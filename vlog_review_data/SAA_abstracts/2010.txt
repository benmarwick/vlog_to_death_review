SYMPOSIUM ABSTRACTS

[1] FORUM · ARCHAEOLOGY NOW: INTERSECTIONS OF THEORY, METHOD, AND PRACTICE IN THE 21ST CENTURY Traditional archaeological activity has been subdivided into discrete categories ­ that are only occasionally subject to synthetic discussion. This balkanization has several negative affects, including theory with little reference to data and methodological incantations that strip the past of nuance or relevance. Recent efforts to reintegrate the various aspects of research in creative ways, however, acknowledge the unity of archaeological practice. This symposium presents five different projects that engage these different "intersections: selected to represent different theoretical perspectives and research contexts, they collectively present a portrait of "archaeology now" that provides promise good and important things to come. [2] SYMPOSIUM · STONE HOES AND BAYONETS IN THE AMERICAN BOTTOM: THE BEGINNINGS OF MISSISSIPPIAN AND EARLY AMERICAN FRONTIER OCCUPATIONS IN GRANITE CITY, ILLINOIS The Alexander Jacob (11MS2288) and the Squire (11MS2244) sites, located in Granite City, Illinois, provide a better understanding of habitation in the American Bottom. The Alexander Jacob site was occupied at the beginning of the Mississippian Period. This planned community was laid out in a horseshoe shape with a large central plaza and an associated mound. The Squire site, occupied one thousand years later, utilized the mound as a family burial area. The farmstead had its own unique character possibly being used as trading factory as well as a gathering point for the local militia. [3] FORUM · RAISING THE PROFILE III: INCREASING PROTECTION FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL (SPONSORED BY GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, PUBLIC EDUCATION COMMITTEE, PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY INTEREST GROUP) This forum concludes discussions held in Vancouver and Atlanta on finding effective ways to promote and strengthen protections for archaeological resources at the local level. The forum will address why local governments benefit from archaeological resource protection, how local programs become established, and what you as archaeologists and citizens can do to bring archaeological resource protection to your communities. As before, case studies will be presented to illustrate effective means of protecting the archaeological record and promoting appreciation of the past at the local level. [4] SYMPOSIUM · RESIDUE ANALYSIS 1: THE TAPHONOMY OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESIDUES (SPONSORED BY SOCIETY FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCES) One issue faced by residue analysts is the taphonomy archaeological residues undergo. One technique utilized to address the questions of how these residues form, of what substances are they are composed, and how they were handled post-excavation, is through experimental archaeology. This enables analysts to create controlled residues for a baseline of comparison. Lab-created residues also allow residue analysts to test different mixes of materials and substances. This session explores the analysis of positive and negative results for experimental residues to better refine and understand the analysis of archaeological residues and the effects post-excavation handling procedures may have on the outcome of results. [5] GENERAL SESSION · AGRICULTURE, ANIMALS AND CLIMATE IN MAYA LOWLANDS [6] GENERAL SESSION · CALIFORNIA ARCHAEOLOGY FROM THE EARLY HOLOCENE TO THE COLONIAL PERIOD

[7] SYMPOSIUM · NAGPRA IN 20/20 VISION: REVIEWING 20 YEARS OF REPATRIATION AND LOOKING AHEAD TO THE NEXT 20 (SPONSORED BY COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN RELATIONS) The passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act twenty years ago changed the practice of archaeology. In spite of the many benefits of NAGPRA, serious deficiencies in the law and in its application weaken tribal authority in regard to cultural heritage, by reducing tribal control and reinforcing the power dynamics that existed prior to NAGPRA's passage. The perceived loss of authority over "specimens" has resulted in an imperialist nostalgia that hinders the development of a truly decolonized profession. Participants in this session will reflect on NAGPRA's consequences and discuss where improvements must be made. [8] SYMPOSIUM · RESULTS OF NEW EXCAVATIONS AT THE MIDDLE PALEOLITHIC SITE OF ROC DE MARSAL The Middle Paleolithic site of Roc de Marsal (southwest France) was originally excavated by an amateur archaeologist in the 1950s and 1960s. Although his work was largely unpublished, the site became famous because of his discovery ofa nearly complete Neandertal child, whom many believe represents one of the few deliberate burials from this time. New excavations took place between 2004 and 2009. This symposium will present the results of this work including detailed discussions of the many hearths discovered there, discussion of the zooarchaeological and lithic studies, and presentation of new interpretations on the deposition of the child skeleton. [9] SYMPOSIUM · THE EARLY FARMING IN DALMATIA PROJECT 20032009: NEW INSIGHTS ON THE SPREAD OF FARMING TO THE ADRIATIC This case study of the spread of farming through the Mediterranean is a multidisciplinary investigation of the inception, development, and impact of an agricultural way of life in Dalmatia. Results of seven years of research at Pokrovnik and Danilo Bitinj indicate that a mature farming system based on numerous domestic plants and animals reached Dalmatia c. 8,000 CalBP. Farming flourished in this new environment, with the formation of large villages that dominated the landscape. The contributors will outline this new evidence and explore its significance for understanding the development of later prehistoric societies in southern Europe. [10] FORUM · SCIENCE IN SUPPORT OF ARCHAEOLOGY: WHAT IS STATE-OF-THE-ART? (SPONSORED BY PALEORESEARCH INSTITUTE) Interactive forum focusing on recommendations for field sampling to match research designs and obtain the most information from archaeobotanic and related scientific analyses. Understanding which analysis is most likely to yield evidence for interpreting the past environment or subsistence questions is the first step in designing an appropriate sampling strategy. Advances in analytical techniques have expanded our ability to ask and answer questions regarding how people lived -- if sampled appropriately. When are analyses complementary and synergistic in their ability to bring the past to life? Our interactive format not only shows what is possible, it encourages questions about specific applications. [11] SYMPOSIUM · THE POWER OF ENVIRONMENT: APPROACHING ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS FROM A POLITICAL ECOLOGY FRAMEWORK With a growing public concern for the environment and an increasing anthropological interest in human-environment interactions, archaeologists are well poised to contribute to critical scholarship on how power relations act on and through the environment. How can archaeology more effectively analyze the dialectical relationship of social and environmental (re)production? And how can the artifactual

2

record be deployed in understandings of the politics of ecology? This panel seeks to confront these issues and present research utilizing theoretical and methodological approaches that address the relations of power present in and part of the environment. [12] FORUM · ESTABLISHING TDAR: THE DIGITAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD Increasingly information about archaeological resources originates in digital formats. Reports are produced, transmitted and viewed in digital form. Digital records of artifacts, features, and other archaeological remains are maintained in databases and analyzed statistically. This situation presents both opportunities and challenges. Digital data are more easily accessed, searched, and shared than paper records, yet digital data are more fragile. Comparability across digital datasets sets must be assessed and addressed for integrative analyses to succeed. The forum describes a disciplinary effort to assemble a digital archive of archaeological reports and data and to provide tools to access and utilize these data. [13] GENERAL SESSION · ARCHAEOLOGY IN MEXICO [14] SYMPOSIUM · WHITHER SOUTHWEST ARCHAEOLOGY? Archaeologists in southwestern North America have led numerous innovations in method and theory, including the New Archaeologies of the early 20th and mid-20th-century. Today very diverse approaches--phenomenological, "processual-plus," and inspired by CAS--compete to produce insight. Meanwhile everyday practice of archaeology changes rapidly as Native Americans increasingly conduct or control their own archaeologies, large databases are constructed, and research production continues to tilt towards CRM. In this symposium we analyze and critique the present and envision desirable futures for the theory, method, and practice of southwestern archaeology. Where would we like to see these centered in 10 years? [15] SYMPOSIUM · CAHOKIA 2010: SITUATING AN ANCIENT INDIGENOUS CITY IN THE WORLD The last decade of intensive and ongoing archaeological and historical research has led to a renewed appreciation that Cahokia, located a few miles east of St. Louis, was a Native American city with a unique historical trajectory. Its peoples' histories were defined by migration, pilgrimage, proselytizing, political-cultural innovation and, finally, diaspora. Participants situate the place, its people, and historical trajectory into continental and global perspective, highlighting the latest findings and multiple interpretations. [16] SYMPOSIUM · COMMON PROBLEMS, UNCOMMON SOLUTIONS? SPECIALIZATION, INTENSIFICATION AND DIVERSIFICATION IN MEDITERRANEAN-TYPE AND ADJACENT ENVIRONMENTS Increasingly, researchers have identified trends of resource specialization, intensification and diversification across the Mediterranean region throughout the late Pleistocene. Key explanations for these shifting strategies include the effects of increasing human populations and environmental change on subsistence efforts. Other regions of the world, though experiencing similar climatic regimes as the Mediterranean basin, have undergone different histories regarding subsistence shifts in response to environmental change and demographic pressure. This session aims to connect current zooarchaeological research in Mediterranean-type environments, with the intention of highlighting different methodologies and theories being applied to understanding subsistence change. [17] SYMPOSIUM · GENDERED LABOR IN SPECIALIZED ECONOMIES (SPONSORED BY WAIG) Current research on craft production suggests that increases in specialization can result in dramatic changes to the gendered division of labor. This session addresses how the manufacture of particular craft items impacted the organization of labor in other sectors of the economy, and/or how shifts in the organization of craft

production resulted from new task allocation in various economic activities. It examines changes to the gendered division of labor in a range of case studies that highlight redefined labor roles for men and women. [18] SYMPOSIUM · THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF HUACAS: EXPLORING THE MATERIALITY, MEANING, AND EFFICACY OF SACRED OBJECTS AND PLACES IN THE ANDES The Andean term huaca generally refers to a sacred thing, be it a place, idol, or image. Given the power huacas were attributed, they constitute an interesting point of intersection with respect to recent discussion concerning issues of materiality, agency, and personhood. The papers in this session approach the agency and efficacy of Andean huacas by focusing on arrangements, relationality, and referentiality between and among objects, contexts, and spaces construed as sacred. A consideration of the relationships between the concept and embodiment of power offers new insights into alternative ontologies and understandings of being in the world beyond the dominant paradigm of Cartesian dualism. [19] SYMPOSIUM · THE VILLAGE ECODYNAMICS PROJECT II The Village Ecodynamics Project seeks to understand long-term interactions between ancient Pueblo peoples and their socio-natural environments. The project is multi-disciplinary and collaborative, and combines empirical research with modeling efforts. Phase II of this project expands the study area in SW Colorado, develops a second study area in the Northern Rio Grande, refines and expands existing paleoenvironmental models, and adds new components to the agent-based simulation. This symposium provides an update on the VEP, introduces Phase II activities, considers the role of multidisciplinary research in archaeology, and addresses the practical matters of running a large, multi-institutional research project. [20] SYMPOSIUM · ONE MORE TANGO AT MAYAPÁN: STUDIES OF URBAN LIFE AT A LATE MAYA POLITICAL CAPITAL Research at Mayapán over the past decade contributes new knowledge regarding the politics, economy, and social life of this Postclassic Maya political capital. Excavations of monumental buildings, dwellings and independent craft workshops enable comparisons of urban life in downtown Mayapán and the distant neighborhood of Itzmal Ch'en. A diverse array of field methods and analyses have generated new data useful for a complex, multidimensional view of the city - by revising estimates of the settlement size and regional context, identifying diversity in occupation, wealth and social identity, and reconstructing the production and consumption economies of domestic, administrative, and ritual features. [21] GENERAL SESSION · PALEOINDIAN STUDIES [22] SYMPOSIUM · ROCK ART IN GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE: THEMES AND TECHNIQUES IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SITE The session is intended to transcend geography in an attempt to achieve a richer and fuller interpretive perspective on rock art. An emphasis is placed on the archaeology of current research. [23] SYMPOSIUM · ACROSS BOUNDARIES: INTEGRATING ARCHEOLOGY & SCIENCE It is unquestionable that technological advances in Archaeometry have revolutionized the way in which we conceptualize Archaeology. This growing transfer of scientific methods of many kinds implies an interdisciplinarity that goes beyond simply working together and that involves collaboration between archaeologists and scientists before, during and after fieldwork. This integration between the sciences and archaeology also requires that the practitioners be broadly educated, well informed and have ample understanding of the archaeological project and the particular problems to be solved. In this symposium we are interested in presentations from projects that have had some success in this integration so we can understand which areas and attitudes promote effective interaction.

[24] ELECTRONIC SYMPOSIUM · PRACTICAL METHODS OF DATA PRODUCTION, DISSEMINATION, AND PRESERVATION This symposium focuses on sharing methods and repercussions of archaeological digital data production, dissemination, and preservation in private sector, governmental, and educational settings. The themes address the scope of changes digital data practices are bringing about everywhere SAA members work, including: (1) relationships between formats, media, representations, models, and archaeological theory; (2) issues between security, career incentives and open access to scientific information; (3) processes of sustainability and preservation of data and the archaeological record; (4) emerging tools, content, standards, and modes of research in an diverse data ecosystem; (5) professional communities, stakeholders, and other 'publics' online. [25] POSTER SESSION · ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. [26] POSTER SESSION · ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. [27] POSTER SESSION · ARCTIC AND SUBARCTIC ARCHAEOLOGY [28] POSTER SESSION · AVOCATIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY MAKING A DIFFERENCE: WHO'S DONE IT AND WHO'S DOING IT- PART 1 (SPONSORED BY THE COUNCIL OF AFFILIATED SOCIETIES) Since the beginning of American Archeology, amateurs, avocationals, and collectors have played crucial roles in our discipline. They have been involved in locating and preserving sites, curating collections, lobbying for legislation, providing financial support for projects and institutions, and in so many other roles we are unable to list individually. It is fair to say that many avocational archeologist have been at the forefront of American Archeology and they continue to be so. In this session we present the past and continued contributions of avocational archeologists from every corner of the Americas. We hope to encourage the general public to become engaged in the past by highlighting the role they can play in our discipline in the future. [29] POSTER SESSION · SITES AND LANDSCAPES IN THE GREAT LAKES AND MIDWEST [30] POSTER SESSION · SUBSISTENCE, HEALTH, AND SOCIETY IN THE MIDWEST [31] SYMPOSIUM · CHANNEL ISLANDS AND COASTAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: RECENT RESEARCH AND COMPARISONS The Channel Islands off the southern California coast provide a unique opportunity to study prehistoric adaptations in an insular environment. Although the broad cultural historical outlines of the region have been examined for over a hundred years, new patterns are emerging from recent research based on more systematic investigations and better controlled samples. Data are presented in this symposium from San Nicolas Island and other areas in southern California, including the Palos Verdes Peninsula, which is sometimes referred to as the ninth Channel Island. Topics include settlement and subsistence patterns, environmental overexploitation, and genetic data on the ancient inhabitants. [32] SYMPOSIUM · LOCAL AND GLOBAL CHANGE: LANDSCAPE, CLIMATE, SOCIO-POLITICAL INTERACTION, AND WORLD SYSTEMS ANALYSIS IN EURASIAN ARCHAEOLOGY This symposium addresses the issues of global variation regional and interaction in different regions of Eurasia, from the Mediterranean basin to the Central Asia steppes. Encompassing a wide swath of time, from the Bronze Age through the Medieval period, case studies will examine relationships between diverse factors such as climatic and ecological changes and socio-political interactions between local communities and confederacies, states, or empires. In exploring the relationship between global and local variation, this symposium seeks to expand upon new and developing

frameworks to re-address the dynamic nature of social responses to driving forces such as climate or socio-political change. [33] SYMPOSIUM · UNWAVERING: CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS ALONG THE U.S. ­ MEXICO BORDER On April 1, 2008, the Secretary of Homeland Security waived over 30 environmental laws and regulations allowing U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to construct tactical infrastructure along the U.S. ­ Mexico border without the constraints of cultural resource legislation. However, CBP and the Secretary were committed to cultural resource stewardship. Assisted by consulting professionals and U.S. Army Corps, CBP developed an internal cultural resource compliance process and completed surveys and mitigation studies from San Diego, California to the Gulf of Mexico in Texas. Papers in this symposium present results from some of the investigations. [34] GENERAL SESSION · EUROPEAN IRON AGE AND MEDIEVAL ARCHAEOLOGY [35] SYMPOSIUM · THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE CENTRAL NAMIB, WESTERN NAMIBIA This symposium explores the results of recent archaeological fieldwork in the central Namib Desert, Western Namibia. This research covers time periods from the earliest hominin occupations of the Pleistocene to the historical period of European contact. The main topics of this symposium include Middle Pleistocene adaptive strategies, modern human origins in the Middle Stone Age, and Later Stone Age forager and pastoralist lifeways. The central goal of this session is to build a better knowledge of the long-term prehistory of this region and generate frameworks for understanding human adaptations to this extreme environment. [36] GENERAL SESSION · HOPEWELL CULTURE LANDSCAPES AND ITS EARLY WOODLAND ANTECEDENTS [37] GENERAL SESSION · IDENTITY AND INTERACTION IN THE DESERT SOUTHWEST [38] POSTER SESSION · AVOCATIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY MAKING A DIFFERENCE: WHO'S DONE IT AND WHO'S DOING IT-PART 2 (SPONSORED BY THE COUNCIL OF AFFILIATED SOCIETIES) Since the beginning of American Archeology, amateurs, avocationals, and collectors have played crucial roles in our discipline. They have been involved in locating and preserving sites, curating collections, lobbying for legislation, providing financial support for projects and institutions, and in so many other roles we are unable to list individually. It is fair to say that many avocational archeologist have been at the forefront of American Archeology and they continue to be so. In this session we present the past and continued contributions of avocational archeologists from every corner of the Americas. We hope to encourage the general public to become engaged in the past by highlighting the role they can play in our discipline in the future. [39] POSTER SESSION · COMPLEX HUNTER-GATHERERS OF INTERIOR BRITISH COLUMBIA: NEW INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH AT THE BRIDGE RIVER SITE The Bridge River site is a complex hunter-gatherer village of approximately 80 large housepits located in south-central British Columbia and occupied between 200 and 2000 years ago. Interdisciplinary archaeological research at the site is currently addressing a wide range of questions emphasizing the development of village life, emergent status inequality, subsistence intensification, uses of domesticated dogs, and village abandonment processes. These posters integrate studies in zooarchaeology, paleoethnobotany, geoarchaeology, lithic technology, and applied geophysics to help create a compehensive portrait of life in this ancient community. They offer new insights into processes of cultural change and continuity.

[40] POSTER SESSION · KIVA: 75 YEARS OF SOUTHWESTERN ANTHROPOLOGY AND HISTORY On the occasion of the 75th birthday of Kiva: The Journal of Southwestern Anthropology and History, posters in this session explore how the support of the avocational Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society and a dedicated group of editors created the Southwest's premier journal. We look at the people and institutions that have made Kiva what it is today. The methodological and theoretical contributions of students and eminent scholars have given Kiva a national and international reputation as one the best places to explore the history and prehistory of the peoples of the Southwest United States and north Mexico. [41] POSTER SESSION · ON THE KNOWLEDGE FRONTIER: THE FIRST DECADE OF CULTURAL RESOURCES DISCOVERY AND MANAGEMENT ON THE VALLES CALDERA NATIONAL PRESERVE Immediately following the creation of this national preserve in 2000, archaeologists began the inventory and resource evaluation in the Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP). This 89,000-acre former private-ranch nestled inside a volcanic caldera in the Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico was an enigma--a high plains Rocky Mountains setting nestled within the American Southwest. As we enter the tenth year of this public land management experiment, we take stock of what knowledge we have built and how our questions about this many-layered cultural landscape have gained momentum or changed direction entirely. [42] POSTER SESSION · TALES FROM THE BLACK RANGE Since 2008 the Gila Archaeological Project, comprising students from Howard University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, New Mexico State University, and the Mescalero Apache Reservation, has been investigating life in the Black Range Mountains of New Mexico during the late 1800s. The focus has been on conflict and coexistence among Apaches, miners, soldiers, and other frontier denizens in and around Hermosa, a small mining community become ghost town. Archaeological, historical, and ethnohistorical research have helped reconstruct the interaction among the different groups. This poster session reflects the different approaches taken to make sense of this critical period in frontier life. [43] POSTER SESSION · THE FRANK CHURCH RIVER OF NO RETURN WILDERNESS PROGRAMMATIC AGREEMENT: CONDUCTING CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN A WILDERNESS SETTING Archaeological fieldwork in the best of circumstances is full of logistical headaches. Adding a wilderness component to the mix can compound a relatively simple task into a complicated one. The Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness Programmatic Agreement between the Idaho SHPO, the Advisory Council, and four National Forests (Bitterroot, Nez Perce, Payette, and Salmon-Challis) is an eight year agreement for managing cultural resources. The document sets up a number of targets to be met over the life of the agreement. This symposium explores the work conducted by each of the Forests in their attempt to meet these targets. [44] POSTER SESSION · HISTORY AND TRAJECTORY OF IRRIGATION AND WATER MANAGEMENT IN THE SOUTHERN SOUTHWEST In 1976 Emil Haury wrote "...Snaketown preserves traces of the oldest irrigation system in the United States and ... is the foremost example of the history of irrigation north of Mexico..." Snaketown's significance notwithstanding, recent research in the American Southwest has expanded our understanding of the developmental trajectory of irrigation technologies, now dated to at least 3500 years ago. This symposium presents current studies of water control in the Southwest from the Late Archaic to the thirteenth century A.D. Environmental, geomorphological, and social parameters are considered in temporal and geographical perspective, underscoring influences of cultural and natural forces on agricultural landscapes. [45] GENERAL SESSION · ARCHAEOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO THE INCA EMPIRE

[46] GENERAL SESSION · ARCHAIC THROUGH LATE WOODLAND CULTURAL DYNAMICS IN THE MIDWEST AND GREAT LAKES AREA [47] GENERAL SESSION · ARCHAEOLOGY OF SOUTH AMERICA [48] SYMPOSIUM · BEYOND THE BIOLOGICAL NEED TO EAT: ARCHAEOLOGIES OF FOOD AND FOODWAYS This session explores new and disparate archaeological approaches to food, which builds upon subsistence and identity-centered frameworks. Participants will interpret food in the archaeological record in theoretically and methodologically innovative ways and apply these perspectives to a variety of archaeological contexts. Topics include: the materiality of food and its role in the construction of identities and subjectivities, field and laboratory methods that facilitate data collection from food-related artifacts, medicinal and other non-subsistence uses of food, and cuisine. The session includes both theory driven explorations and case study-centered papers from a variety of prehistoric and historical contexts. [49] ETHICS BOWL [50] SYMPOSIUM · MEDIA'S IMAGE OF THE ARCHAEOLOGIST THROUGH TIME-- IS THE MEDIA THE MESSAGE (SPONSORED BY MEDIA RELATIONS COMMITTEE) Newspapers are dying and the blogosphere is preeminent, but when newspapers and magazines ruled the news, how did they cover archaeology? How did television and the movies portray us? Through the decades archaeology changed, but are those changes apparent in the media. Is Indiana Jones the stereotype for today's archaeologist or are the bumbling B-movie archaeologists? How was archaeology portrayed when the polio vaccine became available, when men walked on the moon, when gopher was the internet and how will we be portrayed in the future. Media record our lives and our profession, but what is that record like. [51] SYMPOSIUM · CELEBRATING WOMEN IN ARCHAEOLOGY: A RICH AND COLORFUL HISTORY (SPONSORED BY COMMITTEE ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN IN ARCHAEOLOGY) In the last few decades, women have become better represented within the discipline of archaeology. The contributions of women to the discipline have developed over many decades, however, and many of their impacts today are based on the steps that their predecessors took. This symposium seeks to honor the careers of some of the women who have contributed to the development of the discipline and at the same time encourage women to continue to pursue archaeology as a career. Rather than a traditional symposium format with discussants, the participants will participate in an open forum following the symposium. [52] SYMPOSIUM · JOARA AND FORT SAN JUAN: COLONIALISM AND HOUSEHOLD PRACTICE AT THE BERRY SITE, NORTH CAROLINA Archaeologists have discovered few sites that preserve the earliest footprints of European expansion through North America. In 1567, at the native town of Joara, Juan Pardo founded Fort San Juan and manned it with thirty soldiers. Destroyed after just eighteen months, it nevertheless witnessed one of the longest periods of colonial exchange between Europeans and the peoples of North America's interior until the late 1600's. The Berry site in North Carolina is the location of Joara and Fort San Juan. This symposium presents the results of work in the Spanish compound at Berry, focusing on household space and household practice.

[55] SYMPOSIUM · RESIDUE ANALYSIS 2: CURRENT APPLICATIONS OF RESIDUE ANALYSIS TO ARCHAEOLOGICAL QUESTIONS (SPONSORED BY SAS (SOCIETY FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE)) It has become increasingly common for archaeologists to incorporate residue analysis into their regional research programs. The types of data provided from these various studies add new, better and often previously unknown information to the current research, which enables a more nuanced interpretation of the archaeological record. This session pulls together examples from all over the world demonstrating how residue analysis is being used by researchers today to improve the quality of information they uncover. New data derived from residue analyses and how they enhance, modify, or confirm previous site and/or regional models and interpretations are discussed. [56] SYMPOSIUM · FROM THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST TO CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND: PAPERS IN HONOR OF MICHAEL GLASSOW, PART 1 In a career exceeding four decades, Dr. Michael Glassow has exerted a profound influence on the archaeology of California and the Southwest. He pioneered the application of processual analytical methods including ecological, demographic, and evolutionary approaches; promoted the development of cultural resource management; and has been a tireless advocate for the conservation of archaeological sites, quality archaeological research, and professional ethics. The contributions to this session report on the wide ranging results of his influence, encompassing topics from the Pacific Coast to New Mexico and reaching as far as the Kalahari Desert. [57] SYMPOSIUM · RECENT INVESTIGATIONS ON THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF NORTHWEST MEXICO Northwest Mexico occupies a key geographical space between Mesoamerica and the U.S. Southwest. For that reason, this area was previously studied only in terms of outside colonization, migration, and large scale economic systems. As research interest in the area grows, we are finding a much more complex archaeological record, in a wide range of spatial and temporal contexts, which needs to be understood in its own terms. This session presents current investigations in architecture and landscape studies, mortuary analysis, and interregional interaction through ceramic exchange from an array of projects in the modern states of Durango, Zacatecas and Sonora. [58] SYMPOSIUM · THE ROOTS OF THE MIDDLE PALEOLITHIC: AN UNIQUELY EURASIAN EVOLUTIONARY EXPERIMENT The Middle Paleolithic has long been treated as a monotonous interval on the road leading to the Upper Paleolithic and "modern human behavior". Recently, researchers have recognized that, like the hominins that produced it, the Middle Paleolithic represents a distinctive set of evolutionary experiments. Some of its characteristics parallel developments in Africa and some are unique to Eurasia. Likewise, some anticipate the Upper Paleolithic whereas others do not. Symposium participants consider the origins of specific features of Middle Paleolithic behavior, asking when they appeared and what sort of evolutionary processes might have led to their development, spread, and coalescence. [59] SYMPOSIUM · THE BIENNIAL GORDON WILLEY SYMPOSIUM ON THE HISTORY OF ARCHAEOLOGY: SHOVEL READY: ARCHAEOLOGY & ROOSEVELT'S NEW DEAL FOR AMERICA (SPONSORED BY HISTORY OF ARCHAEOLOGY INTEREST GROUP) SAA was founded 75 years ago during the Great Depression. That same year the newly created WPA--the major New Deal work relief program--funded the first of many significant excavations. Today, the US again faces major economic turmoil, and it is time to reconsider the legacy of New Deal archaeology. New Deal excavations continue to shape our understanding of the past as we invoke new technologies and new theoretical approaches to old collections. Archaeologists have also turned to excavating material remains of the New Deal itself. Join our exploration of the past, present, and future of New Deal archaeology.

[60] SYMPOSIUM · THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF INTERACTIONS IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA Elaboration of ritual life, changes in subsistence strategies, and the emergence of social inequalities commonly occur in contexts of increased interactions. This symposium explores the roles of intersocietal contacts in the cultural trajectories and socio-political developments of prehistoric and protohistoric Eastern North America. Individual papers will reflect the variable nature of interactions as well as the need to adapt or combine various theoretical frameworks according to different contexts and scales of analysis. Topics include the role of exchange in the creation of socioeconomic inequalities, the relationship between pan-regional cults and interaction spheres, and the archaeological signatures of inter-societal contacts. [61] SYMPOSIUM · TRAJECTORIES TO COMPLEXITY IN WOODLAND ENVIRONMENTS: EASTERN NORTH AMERICA AND TEMPERATE EUROPE COMPARED The North American eastern woodlands and temperate Europe share a number of environmental and cultural historical similarities: both regions are covered by deciduous forests and over the Holocene both experienced cultural trajectories from simple to complex hunter-gatherers and simple to complex farming societies including technologies and domesticated species imported from other regions. Comparisons between the two regions have been surprisingly rare in recent decades. The session is intended to promote discussion about the methodological and theoretical approaches employed in each area, including debates on possible triggers for developmental dynamics such as socio-political, economic or environmental and climatic parameters. [62] SYMPOSIUM · A DARKER DISCIPLINE: EXPANDING THE FRONTIERS OF WORLD CAVE ARCHAEOLOGY For several decades, archaeologists in many regions have worked with professional speleologists and/or recreational cavers to bring new light to the emerging subdiscipline of cave archaeology. A 2009 symposium on world cave archaeology explored methodologies and interpretations in the study of prehistoric dark zone cave use. The 2010 session will showcase research that further refines our understanding of the archaeology of dark zone caves, with an emphasis on more detailed investigation into the range of prehistoric cave uses, the delineation of ceremonial cave assemblages and activities, and the varieties of data that cave environments can yield. [63] FORUM · A NEW AGE FOR THE SAA: INTERNATIONAL INDIGENOUS ARCHAEOLOGY (SPONSORED BY NATIVE AMERICAN RELATIONS COMMITTEE) Parker's election as the first SAA President was a good start toward involving Native Americans in archaeology. Yet, in 2009, there are still fewer than 30 Native American members. What would increase diversity and take SAA into a new age? Indigenous archaeology can bridge the divide between western science and Indigenous knowledge and provide an incentive for membership. The topic of Indigenous Archaeology will be presented by panelists from Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the U.S. Open discussion will explore Indigenous roles within the SAA and how the SAA might become more active in Indigenous Archaeology nationally and internationally. [64] SYMPOSIUM · ANIMALS AND INEQUALITY IN THE ANCIENT WORLD Wealth associated with animals is commonly derived from a complex combination of the prestige of mastering animals, the role of herds as property, the symbolic role of animals as metaphors for specific cultural values, and the production of meat, secondary products, and offspring. The processes of hunting, herding, slaughtering, butchering and consuming animals and their products are so vital to the practices of everyday life that they inevitably become invested with powerful and dense layers of meaning. Moreover, animal remains and iconography are archaeologically recoverable; the ways in which domestic and wild animals cross the boundaries of nature and culture can tell us a great deal about the ways people organized

6

ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 75TH ANNIVERSARY MEETING

concepts of order, inequality, and difference in past societies, from the divine were-jaguar of Mesoamerica to the bulls of Neolithic Anatolia. This session will explore the diverse ways that animals and their associated products, both material and ideological, constitute sources of wealth and status for hunters, pastoralists and sedentary farmers alike in a global context. [65] SYMPOSIUM · EVERY PLACE IS A NODE: RETHINKING CENTERS, PERIPHERIES, AND PATRIMONY IN HONDURAS Honduras is often described as a liminal place at the intersection of multiple cultures or margins of significant historical events. Under Dr. Darío Euraque, the I.H.A.H. has broadened definitions of cultural patrimony by advancing scholarship across Honduras, fostering national and international partnerships, and promoting community consultation, education, and information dissemination. Reevaluating what constitutes patrimony and its role in the construction of multiethnic identities has decentered narratives about cores, peripheries, and margins. When we reconceptualize every place as a node in multiple networks of sociopolitical relationships, we can consider how shifting practices, hierarchies, continuities, and conflicts define Honduras's past and present. [66] FORUM · THE LIFE OF A PROJECT: NEGOTIATING THE PRACTICALITIES AND ETHICS OF COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH (SPONSORED BY INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS INTEREST GROUP) Our professional training as archaeologists rarely addresses the nuts-and-bolts of how one builds collaborative relationships with communities or deals with the ethical dilemmas that are unique to community-based research. This forum draws upon the experience of participants to discuss the basic strategies used to negotiate access, build community partnerships, and deal with the unanticipated challenges of collaboration. Particular attention will be given to the ethics of collaboration and how researchers navigate issues such as reconciling archaeological narratives with community narratives, and balance their professional integrity with their responsibility to the members of a community. [67] Symposium · Hunting Red Gold: Updates in the Prehistory of Spondylus in South America The colorful bivalve Spondylus is widely recognized as playing an important role in many societies throughout prehistoric South America, but we, as archaeologists, have fallen behind. Many interpretations of Spondylus are based upon works presented in the 1970s, often taking into account relatively few recent finds, of which there have been hundreds, if not thousands. This session will update our knowledge of patterns and variability as well as our interpretations in the use of Spondylus throughout prehistoric South America. [68] SYMPOSIUM · POLYNESIAN DIASPORA: PREHISTORIC CONTACTS WITH THE NEW WORLD The possibility that Polynesian voyagers reached the shores of the New World before Europeans has been considered by scientists and non-scientists alike for nearly two centuries. In North America where the case for contact has focused on sewn-plank boat technology and fishhooks, the possibility was discussed regularly between the 1910s and 1950s. In South America the case for diffusion, based on an array of material and linguistic evidence, was considered as far back as the early 1800s. In the last five years scholars have started reexamining these cases, and in this session we will present recent archaeological, linguistic, and genetic research that confirms prehistoric cultural exchanges between Polynesia and the New World. [69] FORUM · ESTABLISHING PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR FORENSIC ARCHAEOLOGY Forensic Archaeology has made the transition from isolated individuals to an established discipline through a very organic process. As we seek recognition from the forensic community, should forensic archaeology establish a standard code of practise? Should forensic archaeologists be certified in some way, similar to

forensic anthropologists or fingerprint experts, in order to legitamately practise? How can we get the American Academy of Forensic Science and others to recognise forensic archaeology as distinct from forensic anthropology? This forum will discuss such issues and how the forensic archaeology community can continue to solidify itself and its position within the wider forensic community. [70] SYMPOSIUM · FROM EFFIGY MOUNDS TO MIDDENS: CULTURAL CHANGE AND CONTINUITY AMONG LATE WOODLAND POPULATIONS IN WISCONSIN Recent ceramic, osteological, and geo-spatial studies have brought to light significant new data about human behavior during the Late Woodland period (circa AD 300-1100) in Wisconsin. Syntheses of these data have required reappraisals of material culture relationships in this time period as well as to earlier and later time frames in Wisconsin. The papers in this session address previous interpretations of people and places, providing new insights to our understanding of how people used the landscape of Wisconsin during this time period. [71] POSTER SESSION · EVIDENCING ANCIENT CARBOHYDRATE REVOLUTIONS IN SOUTH-CENTRAL NORTH AMERICA Hot-rock cooking features, associated stone tools, plant microfossils, and charred plant foods in south-central North America--Texas and vicinity--attest to ancient carbohydrate revolutions 9,000-2,000 years ago, a timeframe consistent with patterns elsewhere on the continent. Posters explore temporal and functional relationships among geophyte and nut macrofossils and microfossils, as well as known and expected morphological variation in earth ovens and stone-boiling activities. The nature and distribution of cook stone features and the potential of wild plant food microfossils--starch grains, phytoliths, and plant fibers--are explored as reliable measures of dietary change and land-use intensification with bioanthropological ramifications. [72] POSTER SESSION · GREAT PLAINS AND ROCKY MOUNTAIN ARCHAEOLOGY [73] POSTER SESSION · MAPPING, IMAGING, AND MODELING IN ARCHAEOLOGY [74] POSTER SESSION · PALEODIETARY ANALYSES [75] POSTER SESSION · SCIENCE, CHALLENGES, AND CONSERVATION: MANAGING HERITAGE RESOURCES IN THE 21ST CENTURY ON BLM'S NATIONAL LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION SYSTEM With the creation of the National Landscape Conservation System in 2000, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) embarked on a new endeavor to manage 27 million acres of some of the West's most spectacular landscapes, including some created specifically for heritage values. Its challenge is to manage these special places within the framework of BLM's conservation mandate in the context of multiple use. These posters will illustrate an array of archaeological projects, management challenges, technological developments, and the critical roles of partners to create meaningful interpretation, education, and science about the System's Heritage Resources. [76] SYMPOSIUM · KEY ISSUES IN DIGITAL CURATION (SPONSORED BY COMMITTEE ON MUSEUMS, COLLECTIONS, AND CURATION) Technological advances have changed the way museums and repositories curate information and images as well as how they share data with professional archaeologists and an increasingly global general public. The nearly universal use of databases by archaeologists and collections managers and the rise of the World Wide Web and digital photography are improving how we document collections and how we serve the users of collections. Nonetheless, institutions all over the world are now wrestling with difficult issues related to digital curation. This symposium explores, mainly through case studies, how the profession is approaching issues of permanence, funding, standards, and access.

[77] SYMPOSIUM · RECONSTRUCTING HISTORIES AND LAYERS OF MEANING: MATERIAL ANALYSES FROM EL PERÚ-WAKA' AND ENVIRONS The Maya city of Waka' and its hinterlands have been the subject of on-going field research and laboratory analysis since 2003. In conjunction with other data, material analyses are bringing interpretations of excavated contexts and reconstructions of social life into sharper focus. Project archaeologists report on the interplay of material and contextual data as they build syntheses that deepen our understanding of life in the kingdom during its 1300-year history. [78] SYMPOSIUM · PUSHING THE ENVELOPE IN CROSS-CULTURAL ARCHAEOLOGY Archaeologists are quick to champion cross cultural approaches but are generally slow at developing them. This session takes a look at various approaches to cross cultural work in archaeology, and asks where cross cultural archaeology might go. From various standpoints, the contributors discuss cross cultural approaches that focus on larger scale systemic cycling, world systems approaches, ideological approaches, social structural designs, and infrastructural commonalities. Discussion will focus on common problems and potentials in the field, as well as "pushing the envelope" on cross cultural approaches. [79] GENERAL SESSION · ARCTIC & SUBARCTIC ARCHAEOLOGY [80] SYMPOSIUM · SHIPWRECKS AS PART OF OUR MARITIME CULTURAL HERITAGE The same principles of cultural heritage apply to shipwrecks as to terrestrial archaeology sites: both form an integral part of this country's past and should be protected. Just as different techniques apply to excavation and interpretation, different laws also apply. Before 1987, shipwrecks were governed by federal laws. Although the 1987 Abandoned Shipwreck Act gave each state title to shipwrecks in their borders, protection is still an issue. This session discusses what can happen when treasure hunters gain control of shipwrecks, how nautical archaeologists work within the present legal framework, and what more needs to be done to protect shipwrecks. [81] SYMPOSIUM · FROM THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST TO CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND: PAPERS IN HONOR OF MICHAEL GLASSOW, PART 2 In a career exceeding four decades, Dr. Michael Glassow has exerted a profound influence on the archaeology of California and the Southwest. He pioneered the application of processual analytical methods including ecological, demographic, and evolutionary approaches; promoted the development of cultural resource management; and has been a tireless advocate for the conservation of archaeological sites, quality archaeological research, and professional ethics. The contributions to this session report on the wide ranging results of his influence, encompassing topics from the Pacific Coast to New Mexico and reaching as far as the Kalahari Desert. [82] GENERAL SESSION · GENERAL OLD WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY [83] SYMPOSIUM · CURRENT RESEARCH ON THE COLLECTIONS FROM THE ORENDORF SITE, FULTON COUNTY, ILLINOIS Ongoing analysis of artifacts and ecofacts from the several Orendorf habitation sites and human remains, largely from the mortuary precinct, are adding to our understanding of the Spoon River Middle Mississippians of the Central Illinois River Valley. The contents of approximately 300 public and private buildings (many catastrophically burned), and 2500 storage/refuse pits and other features are yielding a richly detailed picture of 13th century life at this fortified temple town. The continuing analysis of the remains of ca 300 former Orendorf inhabitants is adding even more detail to our understanding of the population.

[84] SYMPOSIUM · TURDS, TURKEYS, AND TICKS ON CEDAR MESA: NEW INSIGHTS FROM OLD COLLECTIONS Existing collections from 1970s fieldwork on Cedar Mesa, SE Utah are providing new information for current questions as well as stimulating additional research. Topics include DNA evidence of genetic relationships of both Basketmaker II human and turkey populations; evidence of early turkey domestication and diet; nutritional effects of stone-boiling maize with limestone; and Basketmaker II versus Archaic biface technology. Also reported are two possible Chacoan great houses and their relationships to other Cedar Mesa cultural complexes. Finally, tree-ring data and ceramic attributes (including rim ticks) clarify the timing, process, and regional relationships of 13th century Cedar Mesa depopulation. [85] SYMPOSIUM · ANTHROPOLOGICAL GEOPHYSICS: SCALE AND CONFIGURATION IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD While geophysical techniques are becoming widely used in archaeological settings, few attempts have been made to extrapolate this potential to exploring broader anthropological theoretical issues. Most current applications of archaeological geophysics relate to 1) the use of various techniques to determine more accurately material distributions at known sites, and 2) archaeological prospection to "find" sites. What are the questions that can be addressed, and how do geophysical techniques answer them? This symposium attempts to move beyond assessment of technique and calibration of machines to address questions of scale and configuration in the archaeological record, ranging from monumental architecture to ephemeral campsites. [86] SYMPOSIUM · ARPA AT 30: LESSONS LEARNED FOR THE FUTURE (SPONSORED BY GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE) During ARPA's 30 year history, certain key developments and factors have affected the use of the statute to protect cultural resources. This symposium will analyze these important aspects of ARPA's history to consider the lessons learned from the first 30 years. The goal is to suggest ways that the act either can be used more effectively or changed to better achieve its purpose in the future. Specific ARPA topics to be dealt with are: criminal investigations involving prehistoric and historic resources; new investigative technology; undercover investigations; protection of submerged resources; restitution and civil penalties; and archaeological damage assessment. [87] SYMPOSIUM · DIVERSITY ON THE EDGE OF THE SOUTHWEST: LATE HUNTER-GATHERERS AND FARMERS OF THE JORNADA MOGOLLON Recent investigations in the Jornada Mogollon region of southeastern New Mexico and western Texas demonstrate that the area's late preceramic through Formative periods encompassed far greater geographical and chronological diversity in subsistence, settlement and technology than previously recognized. For example, intensive farming and storage began much earlier in parts of the region than once thought, diachronic changes in mobility and subsistence east of the Pecos look similar to those previously documented in Southern New Mexico, and substantial asynchrony exists in development of agricultural adaptations among various Jornada areas. The session explores these commonalities and contrasts across the Jornada Mogollon. [88] GENERAL SESSION · METHOD, THEORY AND PRACTICE IN ARCHAEOLOGY [89] SYMPOSIUM · ARCHAEOASTRONOMY IN THE AMERICAS New finds of astronomical systems in North and South America resemble well-known Mesoamerican complexes. Solstice and other universal alignments contrast with planetary and constellation alignments unique to the Americas. Archaeological examples include hieroglyphs, light- and shadow-casting instruments, view and reference points, architectural orientations, and gaze. Astronomical systems were widespread in South American before 2,000 BC and persisted through historic times in both hemispheres. Alignments

were calendars and organizers of space; many were used to maintain fertility of the land through management of the sky. Agriculture, religion, political economy, and mythology explain the origin and rapid evolution of astronomical complexes. [90] SYMPOSIUM · IN THE EASTERN FLUTED POINT TRADITION This session presents new research in eastern Paleoindian archaeology. Participants report on the discovery of new sites and re-investigations of some classic sites in the region. New approaches and data provide an opportunity to re-evaluate Paleoindian adaptations during the late Pleistocene, highlighting the importance of eastern Paleoindian studies in understanding the early settlement of North America. Papers from this symposium cover a wide geographical region extending from the Southeast to the Canadian Maritimes. [91] SYMPOSIUM · NEW APPROACHES TO THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF BLUE CREEK AND NORTHWESTERN BELIZE After 18 years of field work, the Blue Creek Archaeological Project has redefined its research foci into a set of intetwined research domain. These include: Modeling Maya Cities and Their Political Economies, Collapse: The end of the World as they Knew It!, Wetlands and Dryland Agriculture, and Elite Behavior. While our work emphasizes the value of long-term field work, we also integrate innovative research designs. [92] GENERAL SESSION · RECENT RESEARCH IN EGYPT, THE NEAR EAST, AND THE GULF REGION [93] FORUM · DIGGING UP THE FUTURE OF PUBLISHING: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE AMERICAS DIGITAL MONOGRAPH INITIATIVE In March 2009, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded a grant to six university presses seeking to enhance book-length monographs in the field of archaeology by incorporating more robust data sets that take advantage of technologies made available by digital publication. Key stakeholders of the Archaeology of the Americas Digital Monograph Initiative and related digital archaeology projects will discuss the complex dynamic of sustainability, standards and specifications, and technology platforms and tools in the effort to expand the range and impact of archaeological publications by providing greater access to important underlying data sets. [94] SYMPOSIUM · ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE VALLEYS OF COCHABAMBA: A SESSION IN MEMORY OF CRAIG MORRIS (SPONSORED BY COMMITTEE ON THE AMERICAS) The valleys of Cochabamba are an essential region in our understanding of the Andean cultural system. This exclusive session dedicated to the valleys will present research work of the last two decades dealing with the complete prehistoric sequence. This research has produced an important set of data that has allowed us to refine some important issues in the evolution of Andean local and expansionist societies. Craig Morris, to whom this session is dedicated, made important research on assessing the high value and tight control of the Inca Empire in Cochabamba. Similarly, important research on previous large-scale societies such as Tiwanaku has made important steps towards fine tuning our understanding of how Tiwanaku society embraces the local political societies. [95] FORUM · THE LIFE HISTORIES OF OBJECTS IN EAST ASIAN PREHISTORY AND HISTORY This forum focuses on the topic of shifts in the meaning and function of artifacts over time in East Asia. The participants recognize the need to incorporate into the study of past societies in East Asia varied theoretical and comparative approaches that have to date been mostly ignored by scholars of this large region. The forum therefore serves as an ideal setting for a discussion of the strengths and limitations of such approaches, as well as their applicability to each participant's research topic. It is planned that the forum will lead to an edited volume on the topic.

[96] SYMPOSIUM · STOREROOMS, TOKENS AND ADMINISTRATIVE DEVICES IN EARLY COMPLEX SOCIETIES This will address the emergence of bureaucratic actions to block, control and record surplus goods and people; it will review the data on administrative devices in early complex societies in Mesoamerica, the Andean Region and the Near East. In the Near East there is increasing awareness of goods levied, their storage, and methods of control. In the Andean Region, we have an idea of how state-controlled storage facilities were disposed along the main roads of the Inca empire, but have yet to trace the evolution of storage facilities. In Mesoamerica very little has been done to trace administrative activity areas and technology. [97] GENERAL SESSION · NEW TECHNICAL APPLICATIONS TO CARIBBEAN ARCHAEOLOGY [98] GENERAL SESSION · RECENT RESEARCH IN COASTAL PERU [99] GENERAL SESSION · MAYA ICONOGRAPHY AND RITUAL [100] SYMPOSIUM · ALLIANCE AND LANDSCAPE ON PERRY MESA, CENTRAL ARIZONA Compelling evidence for endemic warfare has been documented in many areas of the Southwest. Among them is the Verde Confederacy, described as a highly coordinated alliance that encompassed much of central Arizona. In the late 1200s, pueblos were built above the sheer cliffs of Perry Mesa and overlooking access routes onto the mesa top. Was this migration a strategic deployment to create an integrated "castle defense" atop the mesa and bolster the western flank of the confederacy? Or did climatic change attract migrants to a landscape with improved agricultural capacity? Multiple lines of evidence are mustered to evaluate these ideas. [101] GENERAL SESSION · EXPLORING THE EUROPEAN BRONZE AGE [102] SYMPOSIUM · THE LATE PREHISTORIC AND PROTOHISTORIC COMPONENTS AT THE NEW LENOX SITE The New Lenox site is clearly important for understanding the transition from prehistoric to proto-historic lifeways in northern Illinois. Radiocarbon assays with corrected dates ranging from 1278 to 1666 have been obtained from the excavation of over 250 features (including a burial, hearths, processing, storage and trash pits). Several partial structures and three complete structures were uncovered; whole structures include an Oneota long house, a semisubterranean Langford house, and a large enclosure of unknown function. The well preserved flora and fauna, lithics, ceramics and European trade goods seem to suggest only subtle changes during this early contact period. [103] SYMPOSIUM · OAXACA ARCHEOLOGY: RECENT RESEARCH ON PRE-HISPANIC SOCIETIES In recent years archaeologists have carried out research in the Valley of Oaxaca and the adjacent Mixteca Alta and Baja in Oaxaca, Mexico, which has yielded information about the pre-Hispanic Zapotec and Mixtec groups that inhabited these regions. This symposium will disseminate the results of recent interdisciplinary research, addressing topics such as iconography, religion, social hierarchy, settlement patterns, agricultural economics, health and nutrition, and spatial analysis. New proposals for managing cultural resources will also be discussed. [104] SYMPOSIUM · ARCHAEOLOGY WITH STYLE: CELEBRATING THE RESEARCH CAREER OF MARGARET W. CONKEY (SPONSORED BY ROCK ART INTEREST GROUP) Margaret W. Conkey has had a profound research impact in almost all areas of archaeology. Her contributions in the discipline have had global reach and resonate in research agendas from Australia to the Pyrenees. Meg Conkey has been one of the leading voices in the development of both the archaeology of gender and Indigenous

archaeology. The session celebrates and focuses specifically on her contribution to rock art research and her theoretical contributions to style, semiotics, aggregation, gender, and landscape. It recognizes that a major contribution of Conkey's work has been the contextualising of rock art in broader archaeological discourse. [105] GENERAL SESSION · OLD PROBLEMS AND NEW INSIGHTS INTO ONEONTA AND FORT ANCIENT SOCIETIES [106] GENERAL SESSION · OLD WORLD POLITICS AND ARCHAEOLOGY: PAST AND PRESENT [107] SYMPOSIUM · SEDUCED BY THE DARK SIDE, PART 1: EXPLORING CAVES IN MESOAMERICAN ICONOGRAPHY Following David Stuart's decipherment of a glyph for cave, it became apparent that the Maya were indeed writing about their subterranean world. The time is ripe to extend those insights to the larger realm of artistic endeavor. This is the first session dedicated exclusively to the interpretation of iconographic representations of caves, symbols and motifs associated with caves, and iconography found within caves. This session seeks to explore on the breath of representations related to caves to develop a deeper and more nuanced understanding of how Mesoamerican people viewed these important landscape features. [108] GENERAL SESSION · LITHIC AND LANDSCAPE STUDIES IN NORTHWESTERN NORTH AMERICA [109] GENERAL SESSION · MAYA ARCHAEOLOGY IN YUCATAN [110] SYMPOSIUM · TRIALS BY FIRE: ARCHAEOLOGIES OF BURNED SITES AND FEATURES Understanding site formation processes is central to archaeological interpretation. Burned structures, features, spaces, and entire sites occur across every time period and geographic area, yet archaeologists have rarely made a systematic effort to investigate and assess the natural and cultural factors contributing to the creation of burned sites and feature. A cross-cultural study of different cases of burned sites and structures will help archaeologists articulate and understand the varied cultural as well as the physical processes of fire and heat in their dual roles in destruction and preservation of the archaeological record. [111] GENERAL SESSION · ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE PLAINS AND ROCKY MOUNTAINS [112] GENERAL SESSION · MONUMENTAL ARCHITECTURE IN THE MAYA LOWLANDS [113] SYMPOSIUM · NEW APPROACHES IN REGIONAL NETWORK ANALYSIS Archaeological research on interregional interactions has been making increasing use of network analysis. Once confined to studies of island archipelagos, network methods are now seen across a wide range of contexts. The papers grouped together in this session represent this diversity, ranging from Neolithic to Medieval, and from Japan to the US Southwest. By juxtaposing such a range of case studies we hope to tease out some of the pros and cons of network analysis. We will also ask if a more standardized set of methods is desirable, and if so how this might be achieved. [114] SYMPOSIUM · ARCHAEOLOGIES OF INTRUSIVENESS Intrusions into the archaeological record are often considered irksome, destructive events with little heuristic value, and intrusiveness has received little conceptual framing in archaeology. Yet, intrusiveness pervades our inquiry, from past events to issues of cultural heritage and our own status as intruders on the past and its descendant communities. This session aims at exploring the various intertwined aspects of the archaeologies of intrusiveness and will help to understand intrusiveness in archaeology from why and how certain sites are used, abandoned, and re-used over time,

to the distribution of intrusive physical evidence, and methods to ethically deal with intrusive phenomena. [115] SYMPOSIUM · JAMES BROWN AND THE IMPACT OF CAHOKIA IN THE MISSISSIPPIAN SOUTHEAST Understanding the iconography of Mississippian artwork from across the Southeast has expanded recently with the linkage of the art styles to specific regions, and specifically Brown's work tying the Braden school to 13th century Cahokia. Classic Braden style artwork, seen on media of ceramics, shell, copper, and rock, was connected to ritual activities that took place at Cahokia and other Mississippian communities in the greater Southeast. Papers in this symposium explore connections across the Mississippian Southeast as objects made in one community were carried to distant locations, sometimes heirloomed, and brought together and deposited as part of new rituals. [116] SYMPOSIUM · RETHINKING PRECOLONIAL SOCIALITIES IN THE ANCIENT CARIBBEAN Recent approaches in archaeology of the ancient Caribbean have come to focus less on determinative models of social change and top down approaches to social organization. This is in part a result of the application of concepts derived from social, complexity and exchange theories for elucidating the constitution of ancient societies. This symposium presents a series of case studies from the ancient Caribbean influenced by these frameworks and offer alternatives to traditional conceptualizations to social organization and transformation in the region. These studies demonstrate the utility of social theory and related concepts and offer more nuanced view of community, identity, politics, power and migration in the shaping of complex socialites in the region. [117] ELECTRONIC SYMPOSIUM · THE CANVAS OF SPACE: METHOD AND THEORY OF SPATIAL INVESTIGATIONS IN THE 21ST CENTURY In the last two decades, the increasing adoption of spatial technologies has created a series of specialized methodological and theoretical approaches to interpret patterns of human behavior. Unfortunately, the lack of integration between these approaches inhibits our understanding of the creation, maintenance and transformations of space within the cultural landscape. The session highlights how important it is to explore, interpret and connect spatial methods, theories and interpretations utilized within and between these approaches. This will help to develop a more inclusive understanding of the cultural canvas associated with communities and individuals in the past and present. [118] SYMPOSIUM · SEEDS OF CHANGE: EARLY HOLOCENE SUBSISTENCE DIVERSIFICATION AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE ACROSS THE DESERT WEST Stimuli behind technological change and marked shifts in subsistence economy are central questions in archaeology whose explanations often appear linked. One example, the shift toward diverse and low ranked food resources, has been identified through changes in floral and faunal assemblages and increased numbers of grinding tools around 8-10,000 years ago. The goal of this symposium is to present new field and laboratory research concerning the advent of subsistence diversification and its relationship to corollary technological change in arid western North America. Particular attention is given to the adoption of small seed resources, whose intensive exploitation ultimately led to the domestication of cereals. [119] SYMPOSIUM · ARCHAEOLOGY IS ANTHROPOLOGY: CELEBRATING 50 YEARS WITH LEWIS R. BINFORD Lewis Binford is one of the most influential archaeologists in the world, whose intellectual explorations span most continents and human societies from the Pliocene to the 21st century. As the father of New Archaeology, he brought processualism, middle range theory, ethnoarchaeology, hunter-gatherer studies, and global scales of analysis center stage. His living legacy includes students and colleagues who have contributed cutting-edge research for five

10

ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 75TH ANNIVERSARY MEETING

decades. Session presenters will discuss the impact Lewis Binford had on their education and professional careers, and offer perspectives on the ways his work and mentorship have permanently transformed the science of archaeology. [120] GENERAL SESSION · ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE WESTERN UNITED STATES [121] POSTER SESSION · ADVANCE IN EXCHANGE STUDIES THROUGH COMPOSITIONAL ANALYSIS The future of archaeology will rely increasingly on analytical techniques requiring the smallest quantities of material to gather the largest quantity of information to address questions related to the diffusion of goods, people and ideas. Over the past decade, the development of laser ablation ­ inductively coupled plasma ­ mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) has opened new avenues of research. LA-ICP-MS is able to determine in a fast and quasi-non-destructive manner the concentration of a large range of major, minor and trace elements within inorganic materials. In this session, advantages and limitations of LA-ICP-MS will be emphasized through the description of different successful archaeological applications. [122] POSTER SESSION · AN INTEGRATIVE VISION: PAPERS IN CELEBRATION OF THE LIFE AND WORK OF PHILLIP L. WALKER (19472009) Phillip Walker embodied the best of anthropological principles and practices, and as a prolific researcher was instrumental in interdisciplinary studies within bioarchaeology, producing contextualized skeletal biology and interpretations of human life integrating biological and archaeological data. He was involved in regional research such as collaborative works with the Chumash and co-directing the Mosfell Archaeological Project. Nevertheless, he also promoted truly comparative approaches as a co-director of the Global History of Health Project. The papers in this symposium celebrate the interdisciplinary and integrative work that Phil avidly nurtured by bringing together new ideas that speak to the spirit of his research. [123] POSTER SESSION · ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE 2010: PART I (SPONSORED BY SOCIETY FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCES) The astonishing growth in archaeological science during the past decade, driven in large part by advances in technology, has culminated in an increasingly interdisciplinary "type" of archaeology that has allowed archaeologists to address a wider range of questions than previously considered possible. Increasingly, these questions are focused on prehistoric social interactions, cultural exchanges, migrations, trade, and the dynamic nature of group identifications. This session highlights analytical approaches and case studies in which science-based interdisciplinary approaches are used to explore questions grounded in modern archaeological science, i.e., archaeobiology, bioarchaeology, and archaeometry (e.g., dating methods, provenance studies, and prospection). [124] POSTER SESSION · THE UWM MILWAUKEE COUNTY INSTITUTION GROUNDS CEMETERY RESEARCH INITIATIVE: PROGRESS AND PROSPECT Fieldwork in 1992 and 1993 on the grounds of the Milwaukee County Regional Medical Center resulted in recovery of some 1600 individuals originally buried in the institutional cemetery. In December of 2007, the Director of the Wisconsin Historical Society determined that materials associated with excavations, including human remains, be transferred to the University of WisconsinMilwaukee (UWM) for final disposition. UWM has been involved in inventory and stabilization as well as identification of problems associated with the collection with the twofold goal of providing information to descendents and access to interested researchers. This session details the many aspects of that process. [125] SYMPOSIUM · HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY Around 1700, French colonists and enslaved African Americans

began establishing military forts, missions, and villages in this region, basing their economy on fur-trading, agriculture, lead-mining, and salt production. After France's defeat in 1763, and especially after the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, British colonists, AngloAmericans, and German immigrants settled among the French descendant communities in the region. By the 1820s, free people of color began settling in the region in greater numbers. The papers in this session address all of these groups, revealing a rich and varied history of occupation in the middle and upper Mississippi Valley from 1700 to 1900. [126] FORUM · QUIET CRISIS IN AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY The often dysfunctional relationship between archaeology, anthropology and the natural sciences in North America will be discussed in light of the recent paper by David Killick and Paul Goldberg in the SAA archaeological Record on the growing gap between North America and Europe in innovations in archaeological science. Each discussant will give brief 5-10 minute opening comments in response to a number of practical and ethical issues that Killick and Goldberg have argued urgently need to be addressed, and the ideas they have put forward to remedy the current situation. This will be followed by a discussion with the audience. [127] SYMPOSIUM · PLACE AS POLITICAL: ARCHAEOLOGICAL VIEWS ON LANDSCAPE, RITUAL AND SPACE Humans often use and view space and landscape differently, their interactions with their surrounding environments being dynamic and flexible as they change through time. The use of space, whether a localized feature or a massive regional landscape, can be a medium in which to express social cohesion, political identity, power relations, and/or ritual ideology. In this session we employ diverse archaeological data sets from the Americas and the Pacific in a discussion of worldwide perspectives on landscapes, viewsheds, and politically and ritually charged spaces. [128] SYMPOSIUM · RITUAL DEDICATION AND TERMINATION OF ARCHITECTURE AND MATERIAL CULTURE IN THE PREHISPANIC SOUTHWEST Archaeologists are increasingly aware of ritual acts conducted during the construction and retirement of architectural structures and spaces. Such actions are often manifested in the archaeological record by burned features, ritual deposits, and dedication or termination objects. Papers in this session will present examples of ritual dedication and abandonment from several regions of the Southwest. The interplay between the mode and materiality of ritual abandonment, settlement mobility and migration, and regional ecological and demographic contexts provides an intriguing area of inquiry and offers new and innovative ways to interpret the archaeological remains of past settlements and societies of the Southwest. [129] GENERAL SESSION · PLEISTOCENE AND EARLY HOLOCENE IN AFRICA [130] FORUM · FACING UP TO AVOIDANCE: A HARD LOOK AT FLAGAND-AVOID ARCHAEOLOGY (SPONSORED BY NATIONAL TRUST FOR HISTORIC PRESERVATION) A common method for avoiding adverse effects to cultural resources during Section 106 compliance is to "flag and avoid" archaeological sites and route development around them. While this may be appropriate on a small scale, its use for large, or large numbers of, undertakings in specific areas may lead to serious cumulative impacts to cultural landscapes. In addition, future site preservation is not guaranteed. Furthermore, flag and avoid yields little information that can further public knowledge and facilitate long-term site management. Panelists in this forum will discuss case studies and explore theoretical and methodological alternatives to flag and avoid archaeology.

[131] SYMPOSIUM · PUEBLO BONITO MOUNDS RESEARCH: FORMATION PROCESSES AND ARTIFACTS The session reports ongoing analytical results from the reinvestigation of archaeological trenches original excavated at Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon by the National Geographic Society in the 1920s. The contributions to this session focus on characterization of artifacts recovered from University of New Mexico excavations between 2005 and 2007 in two large earthen mounds, and the reconstructed formation history these features. [132] FORUM · QUANTIFICATION AND PRESENTATION: EFFECTIVE MEANS OF PRESENTING PLANT EVIDENCE IN ARCHAEOLOGY Archaeobotany is being applied to an ever-expanding set of archaeological research questions beyond subsistence, including those surrounding farming strategies, crop choice, harvesting styles, ritual, identity, daily practices, movement across and meaning of landscape, semiosis, valuation, agency, object biography, modernday conservation and ecology, and materiality. These questions are leading scholars into new ways of quantification and representation of the archaeobotanical data, as well as new ways to link multiple datasets, with more exploratory data analysis employed. This forum brings together a wide range of active, international archaeobotanical scholars to discuss the current situation, compare and contrast effective analyses and open up new ways of presenting botanical data. After brief presentations by the participants, this forum will open up the floor to all attending so that a wide range of scholars can participate in the discussion. [133] FORUM · SOUTHERN VERACRUZ CHRONOLOGY: ASSESSING THE IMPLICATIONS OF NEW EVIDENCE Recent years have witnessed several new projects in the southern Veracruz Gulf lowlands that beg for a reassessment of existing chronological frameworks and a renewed dialogue that explores the implications for local and regional cultural change. This forum is an opportunity to begin discussing the new data from stratigraphic excavations, including radiocarbon dates and artifact technological styles, and regional surveys. We will compare the cross-correlation of new dates and artifact trends between sites and river drainages. Moreover, we will explore what new chronological evidence suggests about larger demographic transformations and consider some revisions of existing chronological and classificatory frameworks. [134] GENERAL SESSION · CERAMIC AND LANDSCAPE STUDIES IN THE MAYA AREA [135] POSTER SESSION · LEGACIES OF RESILIENCE: THE LAKE PATZCUARO BASIN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT As the core of the Prehispanic Purépecha (Tarascan) Empire the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin, Michoacán, Mexico has long been recognized as a core Mesoamerican region. This session presents preliminary results from the on-going "Legacies of Resilience: The Lake Pátzcuaro Archaeological Project (LORE-LPB). Presentations focus on settlement patterns, ancient architecture, agricultural intensification, and socio-political development. [136] POSTER SESSION · ARCHAEOLOGY OF MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA [137] POSTER SESSION · FROM THE MIDDLE TO LATE HORIZON IN THE PERUVIAN ANDES [138] POSTER SESSION · GENERAL SOUTH AMERICA [139] POSTER SESSION · MAYA ARCHAEOLOGY [140] SYMPOSIUM · THE MOOREHEAD MOMENT: THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF CAHOKIA'S 13TH CENTURY REORGANIZATION Much attention has been devoted to the early half of Cahokia's history with its rapid growth in the mid 11th and 12th centuries. Recent archaeological excavations at Cahokia directed our attention

to the social and cultural changes that transformed this ancient city around AD 1200 centered around a highly ritualized core. Careful delineation of the site's settlement history and of changes in its material record during the 13th century evidence a shift in historical development and reorganization. The papers in this symposium address various aspects pertaining to this cultural hinge in Cahokian history -- the Moorehead Moment. [141] FORUM · TIPS, TACTICS, AND TECHNIQUES: FACILITATING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND THE MEDIA (SPONSORED BY MEDIA RELATIONS COMMITTEE) Today's archaeologist can work with a variety of media in presenting information to the public. Most deal with the media intuitively, without a clear understanding of what various media need or want. Media professionals specializing in print media, documentary, public literature, proposal, and press release production, among other areas, will discuss how archaeologists can work with media specialists in getting their message out to the public. The forum will provide attending archaeologists with an opportunity to directly query the discussants as well as discuss media relations issues which they think are important to the SAA and the profession of archaeology. [142] SYMPOSIUM · NEW FRONTIERS IN CENTRAL AMAZONIAN ARCHAEOLOGY Historically, the Central Amazon has been portrayed alternatively as central and peripheral to cultural development in pre-Columbian Northern South America. Over the last 20 years, methodologies developed and successfully applied within the Negro-Solimões confluence region, an important location within the Central Amazon, have prompted a revision of proposed occupational models. New data allow for a theoretical elasticity that goes beyond dichotomies erected by early models. Scholars are developing methodologies to deal with new kinds of data, deepening knowledge of site variability. Equally, this surge of theorizing has prompted scholars to expand research into adjacent geographical regions to evaluate new models. [143] SYMPOSIUM · CROSSING THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS AND FIELDS WITHIN FEMINISM: AMERICAN/HISPANIC CONTEXTS OF THOUGHT This session aims to present how different theoretical traditions (with especial emphasis on Latinamerican and Hispanic ones) and fields of research (archaeological and rock art studies) intersect within feminism, and have been integrated in it. Bringing together scholars from those different contexts, we intend to show how feminism has been developed in them, and what are the potential contributions for a general feminist practice in archaeology. [144] GENERAL SESSION · FROM ANCIENT ROASTING PITS TO MODERN K-RATIONS: NEW STUDIES IN SOUTHWEST ARCHAEOLOGY [145] SYMPOSIUM · INTERREGIONAL INTERACTION AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN PERU FROM 550-1000 AD The period between 550-1000 AD was marked in many parts of Peru by rapid social change and increasing interregional interaction. Although these trends are commonly associated with the expansion, or lack thereof, of the Wari State, there has been insufficient attention given to both tracing the period's dynamic, complex longdistance relationships and demonstrating the different ways that these relations impacted local developments. In this session, scholars moved us past simplistic labels like 'Transitional' or 'Warirelated' by detailing the links during this period between interregional interaction and social change in different regions of Peru. [146] SYMPOSIUM · NEW PERSPECTIVES ON KIMMSWICK, MODOC, AND THE PLEISTOCENE-HOLOCENE TRANSITION The Kimmswick Clovis-Mastodon killsite and the Modoc Rockshelter are world-renowned sites located along the Mississippi Valley near St. Louis. While both sites were last investigated some 30 years ago, they continue to play a key role in interpretations of early lifeways in North America. In this symposium, these two sites are placed within a regional context by reviewing recent investigations at other early

sites in the Middle Mississippi Valley and adjacent uplands. These recent investigations not only provide new perspectives on these two important sites but also provide new perspectives on human-land interactions during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. [147] SYMPOSIUM · FURTHER CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARDS AN INTERNATIONAL INVENTORY OF PREHISTORIC MINES AND QUARRIES (SPONSORED BY PREHISTORIC MINES AND QUARRIES GROUP) Despite the widespread presence of prehistoric extraction sites in the historic environment, many are overlooked or their importance unrecognised, thus placing them at risk. Currently, catalogues are restricted to certain countries or particular stone types, but this is not universal. This session will build upon initial contributions in the construction of an international inventory of prehistoric quarry and mine sites to enlarge and broaden the database and work towards achieving a directory for those working in the field: contributions will provide an overview by country, region, or stone type, to begin to build an international inventory. [148] SYMPOSIUM · SEDUCED BY THE DARK SIDE, PART 2: NEW INVESTIGATIONS IN MESOAMERICAN CAVE ARCHAEOLOGY Mesoamerican cave archaeology is a relatively new and rapidly expanding area of investigation. Its vigor is reflected in the large number of ongoing field projects investigating diverse questions with a multitude of techniques and methods. Increasingly cave investigations are carried out as part of larger surface projects and there is an ever greater integration of the cave component into the larger project goals. Due to the field's youth, theory, methodology and focuses of interest in cave archaeology are developing and changing rapidly. This session brings together results of the most recent studies from across Mesoamerica. [149] SYMPOSIUM · TRAJECTORIES OF CONTACT IN THE CARPATHIAN BASIN: SPECIALIZATION AND THE CHANGING SOCIO-ECONOMIC DIMENSIONS OF BRONZE AGE TRADE "Trajectories of contact" describe the influx of peoples, goods, and cultural connections associated with trade networks across the Carpathian Basin from the 3rd to 1st millennium BC. This session explores specialization and trade and their relationship to markets, labor organization, and social relationships during vast changes in the political economy. Research from multiple projects samples a spectrum of settlements - agrarian societies to polities - to examine variability in the Bronze Age experience. A strong understanding of specialization and the local and regional markets highlights interconnectivity as settlements aggregate, expand, specialize, and stratify, and continually negotiate individual and group identities. [150] SYMPOSIUM · ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ROCKIES EXPRESS PIPELINE PROJECT MISSOURI AND ILLINOIS Archaeological work was conducted for the Rockies Express Pipeline Project from 2006-2009. The project consisted of a 639-mile long corridor that crossed portions of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Data recovery excavations were conducted on 48 National Register eligible sites that could not be avoided by construction activities. The purpose of this session would be to provide information to the professional community regarding the results of these data recoveries, efforts to avoid eligible sites and overall project information concerning all Phases of the archaeological work focusing on Missouri and Illinois. [151] SYMPOSIUM · ISSUES AND METHODS IN ARCHAEOBOTANY Focusing on new methods of inquiry in archaeobotany, this symposium's case studies will highlight some of the methodological problems (and solutions) in current archaeobotanical research. Examples will be drawn from a variety of different regions and ecological zones that address problems of sampling, taphonomy, and identification, as well as issues concerning data dissemination. [152] SYMPOSIUM · THE LARGO-GALLINA: PREHISTORIC INHABITANTS OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST Extant literature generally has characterized the prehistoric Largo-

Gallina (ca. A.D. 1050 to 1300) of north central New Mexico as conservative, isolated and prone to violence. Although the LargoGallina have been classified as a branch of the Ancestral Puebloan culture, archaeologists have not researched it as extensively as other better-known branches, such as Chaco and Mesa Verde. As a result the Largo-Gallina have been relatively ignored or briefly mentioned in prehistoric American Southwestern literature. Current research and findings presented in this symposium are redefining existing perceptions of the Largo-Gallina and creating a better awareness of these distinctive prehistoric people. [153] SYMPOSIUM · TROPICAL FOREST LOW-DENSITY URBANISM IN THE SOUTHERN MAYA LOWLANDS AND SOUTHERN ASIA: PAST AND PRESENT SUSTAINABILITY (SPONSORED BY ARCHEOLOGY DIVISION OF THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION) Since the 1950s and 60s, comparisons have been made between agrarian-based `low-density' urban centers of the Maya lowlands and those of Southern Asia. We explore how people have lived in tropical forests given the landscape, climate, and noticeable wet and dry seasons. We compare the impact of urbanism, land-clearing and the built environment on local ecology, and the role of climate change in the demise of political systems and the re-organization of people across the landscape. In doing so, we set the stage to appreciate how past and present strategies inform on future issues of sustainability. [154] SYMPOSIUM · ARE WE WHAT WE EAT? CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN FOOD DURING CULTURE CONTACT IN NORTH AMERICA Food preferences have always been strong elements of cultural identity and social interaction. English and Spanish colonies in North America had strong influences and sometimes deleterious effects on aboriginal populations. This symposium presents these influences and effects on Native populations as manifest in their subsistence practices. In doing so, the papers offer the unique insights from the colonial and aboriginal perspectives on consumption and adoption of foods. Together, these two arenas, Native and Colonial food practices, will offer insight into culture contact during times of strong culture change across North America between the 1500s and early 1800s. [155] SYMPOSIUM · CURRENT PROGRESS AND NEW RESULTS IN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIVE FIELDWORK IN CHINA Twenty years ago, international archaeological collaborations became possible in China. Soon after, a number of collaborative projects began (Murowchick 1997), and these have had a positive impact on the development of archaeological methods and questions in Chinese archaeology. Recently, international collaborative projects have proliferated [see SAA Archaeological Record 9(3)] ­ from Xinjiang in the northwest to Liaoning in the northeast, Sichuan in the southwest to Fujian in the southeast. This panel brings together participants in such projects to present new data produced by these collaborative efforts. These projects represent the diversity of Chinese archaeology in the 21st Century. [156] SYMPOSIUM · MESOAMERICAN POLITICAL ECONOMY AND THE POLITICS OF PRODUCTION: PAPERS IN HONOR OF KENNETH G. HIRTH From his early studies of interregional exchange in Central Mexico to his groundbreaking analyses of lithics at the urban center of Xochicalco, for close to four decades Ken Hirth has been making important contributions to how archaeologists study political economy, craft production, households, and urbanism in Mesoamerica. The papers in this session highlight Hirth's many theoretical and methodological contributions to archaeology and also present new research that has been influenced by his impressive body of work. Presenters in this session include many of Hirth's longtime collaborators and colleagues, as well as past and present graduate students.

[157] SYMPOSIUM · THE AURIGNACIAN OF THE SWABIAN JURA, SOUTHWESTERN GERMANY The caves of the Swabian Jura in southwestern Germany have long been regarded as key Paleolithic sites. The recent discovery of a female figurine and musical instruments in the basal Aurignacian deposits at Hohle Fels have drawn attention to the region's unique assemblages of symbolic artifacts and confirm southwestern Germany's importance in our understanding of the appearance and development of the Upper Paleolithic in western Eurasia. The current multidisciplinary research program focusing on fauna, genetics, technology, and paleoenvironments allows for the reconstruction and contextualization of Upper Paleolithic economic, subsistence and settlement systems within a broader European setting. [158] SYMPOSIUM · THE PERFORMANCE OF MORTUARY RITUAL IN THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST Mortuary rituals are performances that engage participants in physical dialogues about life and death. This session emphasizes the examination of full mortuary programs in interpreting the mortuary record of the pre-Hispanic American Southwest. Contributed papers address whole sets of ritual practices surrounding death in different times and places in the prehistoric Southwest. These case studies consider how mortuary practices created new identities for the deceased, and defined spaces and places for the dead. In addition, they begin to highlight the many relationships people in the prehistoric Southwest maintained with the dead. [159] FORUM · REFLECTING CRITICALLY ON THE GOALS AND METHODS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL PRACTICE Many archaeologists advocate community-based and indigenous archaeologies that embrace multivocality while others focus on archaeological responsibility to the past. Responding to increasing fissures over what constitutes good archaeological practice, this forum: (1) openly discusses tensions inherent to the archaeoscape; and (2) takes stock of collaborative methodologies. Why do some researchers embrace community-based models, while others distance themselves? Is the concept of "community" flawed or is increasing knowledge of human history the purpose of archaeology? Practitioners and non-practitioners of collaborative archaeologies will have the opportunity to present their investigatory experiences in the hopes of encouraging dialogue about future methods and goals. [160] SYMPOSIUM · THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PERSPECTIVE (SPONSORED BY THE ICOMOS SCIENTIFIC COMMITTEE ON ARCHAEOLOGICAL HERITAGE MANAGEMENT (ICAHM)) The role of perspective in constructing culture goes beyond the panopticon, but is suggested by it. Even before Foucault's work and the widespread use of aerial and satellite remote sensing and GIS, archaeologists acknowledged the importance of surveillance in determining location, movement, and changing condition of resources, knowledge could be used to harvest, nurture, or defend these assets. Today, models of archaeological landscapes at many places in the world suggest that such benefits can be enhanced or undercut by relationships among people that are shaped by where, when, and how they can see and be seen. [161] POSTER SESSION · ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE 2010: PART II (SPONSORED BY SOCIETY FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCES) The astonishing growth in archaeological science during the past decade, driven in large part by advances in technology, has culminated in an increasingly interdisciplinary "type" of archaeology that has allowed archaeologists to address a wider range of questions than previously considered possible. Increasingly, these questions are focused on prehistoric social interactions, cultural exchanges, migrations, trade, and the dynamic nature of group identifications. This session highlights analytical approaches and case studies in which science-based interdisciplinary approaches are used to explore questions grounded in modern archaeological science, i.e., archaeobiology, bioarchaeology, and archaeometry

(e.g., dating methods, provenance studies, and prospection). [162] POSTER SESSION · CAREER PATHS AND THE UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR: HOW ARE WE PREPARING OUR STUDENTS IN THE SAA'S 75TH YEAR (SPONSORED BY SAA COMMITTEE ON CURRICULUM) The presentations in this session provide snapshots of undergraduate programs and how they prepare archaeology students for future careers. Participants have been asked to provide information on the goals of their programs, the kinds of requirements in place, the sequencing of courses, the attention to building key archaeological skills sets and the inclusion of ethical topics as well as to consider data on the career outcomes for their graduates with bachelor's degrees emphasizing archaeology. These presentations are designed to further on-going discussion of the undergraduate curriculum among archaeologists especially in relation to career preparation for the next generation of archaeologists. [163] POSTER SESSION · CURATION, STEWARDSHIP, AND PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY [164] POSTER SESSION · GOVERNMENT ARCHAEOLOGY - WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE AND THE RESOURCE (SPONSORED BY COMMITTEE FOR GOVERNMENT ARCHAEOLOGY ) The SAA Government Committee is sponsoring a poster session that offers examples of projects and programs currently being undertaken by government archaeologists. Projects range from working on archaeological preservation issues in the Middle East to establishing pro-active inventory and stewardship programs for tribal governments. [165] POSTER SESSION · ONE SIZE DOES NOT FIT ALL: INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO CLIENT PROBLEMS Cultural resource professionals confront unique challenges forcing them to develop practical solutions to meet the interrelated requirements of the various Federal, state, and local regulations. State and Federal agencies have standard procedures; however, these cliché methods do not always meet project needs or provide the best solutions. Creative project solutions and alternative mitigation techniques are gaining acceptance throughout the industry. This symposium presents creative solutions that have been implemented and show the strength and weakness of these new approaches. [166] POSTER SESSION · SITE STRUCTURE AND CONSUMPTION: EXPLORING SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL VARIATION AT MONTICELLO PLANTATION This series of posters uses artifact distributions and assemblage compositions to examine the differences between socio-economic groups: enslaved African Americans, non-elite Euro-American workers, and Euro-American elites. The analytical methods employed here are all ways of understanding site structure and assemblage variation that mark patterns of artifact acquisition, use and discard, as well as identifying specialized and general activity areas on various sites. The methods include frequency seriation, correspondence analysis, and mean ceramic dates for chronological control, abundance indexes of consumer goods, and distributions of artifact frequencies and sizes. [167] SYMPOSIUM · THE BATTLE OF BLAIR MOUNTAIN AND THE LUDLOW MASSACRE: LABOR, ACTIVISM, AND HERITAGE IN THE WEST VIRGINIA AND COLORADO COALFIELDS This symposium discusses two major sites of class warfare in the early twentieth century. Research on these conflicts intersects labor concerns, social activism, and heritage preservation. Both sites deserve recognition and preservation. While Ludlow is a relatively well-known labor heritage site, Blair Mountain remains obscure. Worse, the mountain where the largest labor war in US history was fought in 1921 is currently threatened by mountaintop removal coalmining. Comparative analysis of the two sites elucidates class/labor issues, activism in archaeology, and Appalachian socio-

economic inequalities. Collaboration between researchers at both sites is creating new avenues for future political action at Blair Mountain. [168] SYMPOSIUM · FORENSIC ARCHAEOLOGY: RECENT CASES, CURRENT RESEARCH As forensic archaeology continues to be utilised more frequently by crime scene investigators and law enforcement officials, case studies are of great use to those engaged in forensic work. This session aims to highlight recent projects from those active in the field. In addition, those involved in postgraduate study have the opportunity to address areas untouched by current practitioners. This session also features research projects that will be of benefit to forensic work and criminal justice. [169] GENERAL SESSION · CERAMIC ANALYSES AND FIGURINE STUDIES IN MEXICO [170] SYMPOSIUM · NEIGHBORHOOD ARCHAEOLOGY: VOLUNTEERS, COMMUNITIES, AND LOCAL POLITICS The expanding discussions of public archaeology have propelled consideration of the roles for descendant communities, both genealogical descendants and those with social ties to the peoples whose lives are being studied. Consideration of local communities has included the economic potential of heritage tourism and the dynamics of civic engagements. This session seeks to extend consideration of public archaeology as civic engagements within urban neighborhoods. The integration of volunteers, the significance of archaeological sites and historic structures for communities, and the local politics involved in historic preservation focus the papers in this session. [171] SYMPOSIUM · COMBAT IN THE GRASS: DIVERSE PLANS OF ATTACK FOR WARFARE STUDIES OF THE NORTH AMERICAN GREAT PLAINS, PART 1 Research on warfare has a long-standing tradition in the Great Plains, with topics as diverse as the region itself. Recent archaeological studies of armed conflict during the precontact and early contact periods have focused on such diverse data as fortification systems, demographics, human skeletal remains, rock art, and resource availability. Challenging the dueling stereotype of the Plains Indian as ruthless warrior and peaceable ecologist, papers in this symposium reveal a complex mix of ritual warfare, territorial disputes, plunder, and taking of captives for trade and to rebuild local populations following epidemics. [172] SYMPOSIUM · THE AVENUE OF THE SAINTS ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT IN NORTHEAST MISSOURI A multidisciplinary team conducted archaeological investigations at 55 sites in conjunction with the Avenue of the Saints highway project in Lewis and Clark Counties, Missouri. Extensive data recovery investigations were conducted at eight of these sites. The excavations ranged from plow zone stripping/feature excavation to hand excavated blocks within deeply buried alluvial or colluvial deposits. Early Archaic through Late Woodland and historic components were investigated. The analyses included paleolandscape and paleoenvironmental reconstruction along with more traditional archaeological analyses. The papers in this symposium provide an overview of the major sites excavated and analyses conducted of the recovered materials. [173] SYMPOSIUM · THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN ARCHEOLOGY (CAA): IMPACTS BEYOND KAMPSVILLE For more than 50 years the CAA and collaborating institutions have conducted archaeological education, outreach, research and stewardship in west-central Illinois, serving as an entry point for hundreds of future archaeological educators, museum professionals, and archaeological researchers now distributed globally. In parallel, thousands of students of all ages have enjoyed the "Kampsville experience" and thus developed a greater appreciation of past peoples and their environments. This symposium highlights the

CAA's contributions to archaeological method and theory, especially interdisciplinary archaeology, including paleoethnobotany, zooarchaeology, geoarchaeology, and bioarchaeology. Other significant contributions include public outreach and the impact of Koster site research. [174] FORUM · GENDERED SELVES: EXPERIENCES IN AND OUT OF THE CLASSROOM (SPONSORED BY WOMEN IN ARCHAEOLOGY INTEREST GROUP) Whether explicitly teaching about gendered topics or not, as social scientists we know that our intersecting identities -- of gender, race, sexual orientation, nationality, age, ability and other facets -- impact our classroom practices. These differences inform our presentations, influence our interactions with students (with their own intersecting identities), and affect the ways in which students interpret and assess the materials we present. This panel brings together archaeologists with a variety of experiences to discuss how gender and its intersections with other aspects of identity have positively, negatively and/or uniquely impacted experiences with students in and out of the classroom. [175] SYMPOSIUM · SOCIAL ARCHAEOMETRY: PROMISE AND PROSPECTS IN THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES Due to anthropology's historical ambivalence toward the natural and physical sciences, archaeologists trained in North American universities usually receive a rather narrow education in the scientific method. This unfortunate predisposition often results in researchers unable to identify the potentials and limits of theoretically-driven archaeometric methods and techniques, unequipped to utilize them in formulating testable archaeological hypotheses and ill-prepared to anticipate novel research questions and opportunities. This symposium reclaims the relevance of archaeological science to anthropological archaeology, demonstrating how international researchers are innovatively applying natural and physical science method and theory in formulating a new Social Archaeometry for the 21st century. [176] SYMPOSIUM · UNDERSTANDING OHIO HOPEWELL EARTHEN ENCLOSURES Earthworks occur throughout Eastern North America, but are densely concentrated in southern Ohio. Ohio Hopewell earthen enclosures have been recorded in a wide range of shapes and sizes. Although largely overlooked by early archaeological studies focused on mounds and mortuary remains, recent scholars recognize the significance of these ancient monuments and the massive amount of labor invested in their construction. Papers will address a wide range of topics relating to when the enclosures were built, the methods of wall construction employed, the purpose or uses of these enclosures, and the role the enclosures played in Ohio Hopewell society. [177] SYMPOSIUM · HUMAN RESPONSES TO YOUNGER DRYAS IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE: THE OLD WORLD (SPONSORED BY INQUA (INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR QUATERNARY RESEARCH)) Although its causes are currently under debate, the Younger Dryas (c. 11-10.2 kya uncal) event was a sudden and regionally often severe return to glacial conditions, after the marked warming of the Last Glacial Interstadial. Whether, to what extent and in which specific ways YD may have affected human population densities and distributions, mobility, subsistence, technology, social organization and other cultural behaviors throughout Eurasia, from south to north and from west to east, will be explored by this symposium, with an emphasis on broad, comparative regional syntheses and stressing the possibility of significant variability in human responses (if any). Participants are specialists who work in Europe, Siberia, East and SW Asia. [178] SYMPOSIUM · THE ANCIENT MAYA OF YUCATAN: PAPERS IN HONOR OF E. WYLLYS ANDREWS V, PART I E. Wyllys Andrews V has made lasting contributions to our

understanding of the ancient Maya of Yucatan. The Middle American Research Institute Dzibilchaltun Project, of which Will was the last director, provided the first long duration archaeological sequence for the northern lowlands. Will's work at Komchen revealed Middle Preclassic occupation in Yucatan. His writings contributed to our understanding of the rise of Chichen Itza and the end of Classic Maya civilization in the northern lowlands. We honor Will in this session by presenting our recent research concerning the emergence of complexity in Yucatan, the rise of Terminal Classic states, and reorganization during the Postclassic and early historical periods. [179] SYMPOSIUM · ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ROCKIES EXPRESS PIPELINE PROJECT INDIANA AND OHIO Archaeological work was conducted for the Rockies Express Pipeline Project from 2006-2009. The project consisted of a 639-mile long corridor that crossed portions of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio. Data recovery excavations were conducted on 48 National Register eligible sites that could not be avoided by construction activities. The purpose of this session would be to provide information to the professional community regarding the results of these data recoveries, efforts to avoid eligible sites and overall project information concerning all Phases of the archaeological work focusing on Indiana and Ohio. [180] SYMPOSIUM · BEYOND THE BROCHURE 2.0: PUBLIC OUTREACH IN CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (SPONSORED BY PUBLIC EDUCATION COMMITTEE; CONSULTING ARCHAEOLOGY COMMITTEE) Public outreach and education in cultural resource management (CRM) moved beyond the brochure years ago yet many outside of the industry remain unaware of the range of approaches CRM uses to increase the public benefit of projects. This symposium will highlight current strategies, review what the industry has been doing, and explore new perspectives and innovations to engage the public. [181] SYMPOSIUM · HOW ARCHAEOLOGY MAKES ITS SUBJECT(S): GROUPS, THINGS AND EPISTEMIC (IN)JUSTICES Archaeologists have used objects as defining characteristics of what they suppose are bounded social groups, people presumably connected through a shared material culture. Such characterization tends to reduce inquiry into the dynamics of how social and cultural entities develop and engage with their social worlds because an "identity" is already pre-determined. In the contemporary world, such labels can lead to troubling 'epistemic injustices' of static identities and a resulting discrimination. This session addresses impacts of archaeological and epistemological practice on the control and construction of modern identity and how this affects descendant groups and their political, social, and economic access. [182] POSTER SESSION · ASPECTS OF AFRICA ARCHAEOLOGY [183] POSTER SESSION · EAST, WEST, AND SOUTH ASIA [184] POSTER SESSION · EUROPE BETWEEN PALEOLITHIC AND MODERNITY [185] POSTER SESSION · NEW PERSPECTIVES ON LAND, SPACE, AND IDENTITY ALONG COASTAL IRELAND Drawing upon archaeological research, oral histories and historical records, researchers from the Cultural Landscapes of the Irish Coast project seek to develop a multi-faceted understanding of the changing social and economic context of coastal life through time. Presenters utilize comparative perspectives to draw attention to local understandings of the land and the use of coastal areas, from the prehistoric through historical periods, and shed new light upon the dynamics of cyclical abandonment and habitation of coastal Ireland. This research demonstrate the potential for developing nuanced interpretations for changing concepts about space, place and social and geographic landscapes in coastal Ireland.

[186] GENERAL SESSION · FROM THE MID PALEOLITHIC TO BRONZE AGE IN THE NEAR EAST [187] SYMPOSIUM · FROM MOUNDS TO BRICKS: ARCHAEOLOGY OF 19TH-CENTURY ST. LOUIS Known as the Gateway to the West, St. Louis was one of the fastest growing urban centers during the mid-1800s. The city's contributions to the development of American commerce and industry reached its pinnacle during the late-19th century, at which time St. Louis boasted perhaps the most modern infrastructure of any American city. In contrast to this rich history, historical archaeological research has largely overlooked the city and its people. This oversight has slowly been corrected over the past 15 years, but more work remains to be done. This session was organized to highlight recent work in and around the City of St. Louis, and to provide direction for future research. The papers in this session address a wide range of topics including the pre-industrial development of brass manufacturing, the archaeology of a Civil War-era hospital, the usefulness of geophysical survey on urban sites, and the material culture of working- and middle-class households. [188] SYMPOSIUM · RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN SOUTHERN PERU: THE COLLESUYO REGION OF AREQUIPA Archaeological research in southern Peru has emphasized Moquegua and Puno. Meanwhile, the neighboring region of Arequipa has received less attention over the past few decades. Recent work by archaeologists in the upper, middle and coastal sections of Arequipa, offer unique and complimentary interpretations of the interaction between different cultural traditions. This research encompasses sites ranging from the formative to the colonial period, with a special emphasis on the relationship between Wari and Tiwanaku. This session will review research from this area that challenges previous models regarding altiplano imperial expansion and local interaction in the southern Andes. [189] GENERAL SESSION · RECENT RESEARCH IN SOUTH AND EAST ASIA [190] GENERAL SESSION · ARTIFACT STUDIES: MODELING AND EXPERIMENTATION [191] ELECTRONIC SYMPOSIUM · LOOKING BACK, LOOKING FORWARD: SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS OF ARCHAEOLOGY IN PACIFIC CENTRAL AMERICA Seventy-five years ago archaeologists working in Pacific Central America were engaged in fundamental research aided by historical accounts of Mesoamerican relations in the region. Today many of the same issues persist, and while archaeological methods are greatly refined some of the same questions guide research. This symposium brings together scholars engaged in investigations in El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica that are specifically interested in regional interaction. Specific topics for discussion include the definition of archaeological `cultures,' exchange interactions, political organization, settlement patterns, and external influences from the north and south. This is intended as an electronic symposium, in which participants will submit papers in advance and be prepared to discuss them in relation to specific themes.
AFTER

[192] SYMPOSIUM · THE MIMBRES REGION IN THE U.S. SOUTHWEST A.D. 1130 The post-A.D. 1130 period in the Mimbres region of the U.S. Southwest is one of great diversity in a formerly relatively homogeneous area. Recent research has focused on a number of subareas defined by varied sets of geographic, ceramic, and temporal characteristics. This session brings together the disparate research on this area and time period to improve our understanding of both how traditions in these areas differ, and what similar attributes they share. Papers discuss where local traditions fall temporally within the Postclassic time period, and the nature of their connections to previous traditions and to contemporaneous and later developments.

[193] SYMPOSIUM · VECINO ARCHAEOLOGY AD 1780-PRESENT What's in a name? Sustained scholarly interest in Hispanic communities of the northern Rio Grande, from the Bourbon reforms through New Mexican statehood, demonstrates that a name can have far reaching implications. Vecino is ethnically descriptive and action-oriented; it conceptualizes intellectual exchange and downplays unproductive debates. This session, dedicated to Frances Leon Swadesh Quintana, celebrates 75 years of the SAA. It assembles papers that establish Vecino Archaeology as a dynamic field of anthropological and historical inquiry. Current research transcends theoretical significance by contributing to grass roots initiatives, land and water legislation, and education, while engaging the traditional values of paramount concern to descendant communities. [194] SYMPOSIUM · CONSTRUCTING AND ASSESSING EXPLANATIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS Much of what archaeologists do is concerned with explaining and interpreting cultural events and phenomena. The explanations they give mainly focus on how things were in the past and why, as well as how we know. The goal of this session is to investigate how archaeologists actively construct and assess explanation in their work. We will engage with historical or contemporary examples to understand the history of the discipline and suggest future directions in archaeological explanation and interpretation. [195] SYMPOSIUM · INVESTIGACIONES ARQUEOL?GICAS ACTUALES EN MÉXICO En esta ocasión queremos presentar algunos resultados de las investigaciones más recientes de nuestro pasado prehispánico. En la actualidad sabemos de la existencia de numerosas regiones culturales disímbolas y, en muchos territorios, se están realizando diversos y complejos estudios que dan lugar a que este simposio presente un panorama general de la arqueología que actualmente se realiza en México. Debido a lo numeroso de las investigaciones que se están realizando sólo podremos abarcar una reducida muestra de algunos de los lugares donde se desarrollaron las antiguas culturas de la República Mexicana. [196] SYMPOSIUM · SHIFTING FROM OBJECT-CENTERED RESEARCH TO PEOPLE-FOCUSED APPLICATION: CURRENT APPROACHES TO PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY FROM LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN - PART I (SPONSORED BY SAA PUBLIC EDUCATION COMMITTEE) This symposium presents some of the different philosophies and approaches towards a public and applied archaeology as implemented in current programs in Latin America and the Caribbean. Throughout these regions, several projects have begun moving archaeology from an object-centered, academic subdiscipline to a people-focused, holistic endeavor. These projects involve working intimately with local peoples to address such issues as community development, heritage education, constructing community museums, and archaeotourism. As the significance of these projects becomes increasingly recognized, it is imperative that project members share their experiences ­ both best practices and challenges. We hope that this symposium will provide such a forum. [197] SYMPOSIUM · MODELING CONTINUOUS AND DISCONTINUOUS INTENSIFICATION: IMPLICATIONS FOR SOCIOECONOMIC CHANGE The concept of intensification figures prominently in most explanations of socioeconomic change on archaeological time scales, hunter-gatherers through complex civilization. Following Boserup, the concept of intensification has become nearly synonymous with gradual, continuous socioeconomic change. However, evidence can be found in the archaeological record for discontinuous, or abrupt socioeconomic transformation. Participants in this symposium review the role of intensification in commonly used models of continuous change, and present a series of different models that can account for discontinuous adaptive shifts. The models come from behavioral ecology and other recent developments in the evolutionary sciences. We include a discussion

of the implications of these models for the rate and character of cultural evolution, and for the means by which we identify such processes archaeologically. [198] SYMPOSIUM · PERSPECTIVES ON THE ETHICAL ENGAGEMENT OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PRACTICE (SPONSORED BY INDIGENOUS PEOPLES INTEREST GROUP) There are many cooperative and collaborative work efforts between tribes and universities that address the relevance of archaeology to Indigenous peoples and the perceived lack of Indigenous voices in the telling of the history of their own ancestral places. Archaeologists in the private sector also grapple with balancing the requirements of the ethical inclusion of Indigenous perspectives and communities in archaeological work and the constraints imposed by a profit-driven enterprise. Tribal archaeology programs and archaeologists working in the federal sector contend with ethical issues that arise in the practice of inter-tribal consultation that may be hampered by historical conflicts between tribes. We invite participants in this session to reflect upon their own experiences and identify ethical issues in their practice of Indigenous archaeology and/or their work with and for Indigenous groups for discussion. [199] SYMPOSIUM · RITUAL, RELIGION, AND IDEOLOGY OF THE AZTATLÁN TRADITION OF ANCIENT WEST MEXICO Widely acknowledged as representing the northernmost expansion of Mesoamerican culture, the Aztatlán tradition recently has received renewed recognition as a significant prehispanic cultural development and an important link between cultures of Mesoamerica and the US Southwest. The papers in this session detail recent insights on the nature of religious beliefs during the Postclassic Period (AD 900-1521) in West Mexico. Research explores questions of how beliefs and ritual practices are variously manifested in mortuary practices, architecture, art, and symbolism, and necessarily includes discussions about how religion is inextricably intertwined with economic and political organization and interregional interaction in Aztatlán tradition societies. [200] POSTER SESSION · CLAY, ROCKS, AND MINERALS: CURRENT RESEARCH IN THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST [201] POSTER SESSION · NEW PERSPECTIVES IN CARIBBEAN ARCHAEOLOGY [202] POSTER SESSION · NICARAGUAN ARCHAEOLOGY Many diverse groups of peoples inhabited precolumbian Nicaragua. This session primarily focuses on the areas of Granada/Managua and the site of La Flor, in the department of Rivas. These posters illustrate the many distinct faces of these prehistoric peoples. [203] POSTER SESSION · RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN NORTHWESTERN NORTH AMERICA [204] POSTER SESSION · THE USE, ABUSE, AND LACK OF ARCHAEOLOGY IN HERITAGE TOURISM AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE BAY ISLANDS OF HONDURAS The Bay Islands of Honduras have a long history of economic development and ethnic conflict, stretching back to the 1600s when English, Spanish, and Dutch settlers variably tried to establish settlements on Roatán Island alongside indigenous communities that had occupied the region since at least the sixth century AD. This poster symposium brings together past and current archaeological research in the Bay Islands to consider the role of archaeology in shaping and representing the island's identity for residents and visitors. The posters also address the consequences of modern development taking place on the islands and the effects of the growing heritage tourism industry.

[207] GENERAL SESSION · SETTLEMENT, SUBSISTENCE, AND SOCIAL CONTEXTS IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST [208] FORUM · CRITIQUING MICHAEL B. SCHIFFER AND HIS BEHAVIORAL ARCHAEOLOGY Over three decades ago (Schiffer 1972), Behavioral Archaeology was proposed to address the deficiencies of Processual Archaeology and thus complete the Kuhn-like paradigm shift in archaeology. Such a shift to Behavioral Archaeology, or any type of archaeology, never transpired as planned. Instead, Behavioral Archaeology has become but one of a number of players in an ever expanding theoretical landscape. What then has been the contribution of Behavioral Archaeology? A group of distinguished scholars, none of them self-identified Behavioral Archaeologists, have been assembled to assess the role of Michael B. Schiffer and his Behavioral Archaeology in the history of archaeological theory. [209] FORUM · FOOTPRINTS OF THE ANCESTORS: INTERGENERATIONAL LEARNING OF HOPI HISTORY AND CULTURE Archaeological sites and the oral history surrounding them cultivate an understanding of past cultural traditions that are linked to today's Hopi people. Hopi youth, elders, and archaeologists participate in cultural activities at ancestral sites sharing knowledge and stories about these places. Hopi youth produce a "Digital Hopi Youth Guide" for each site in the form of DVDs and websites. Service projects also help Hopi youth take responsibility and give back to their communities. This forum discussion among Hopi youth, elders, archaeologists, and multimedia developers presents our intergenerational collaboration that assists Hopi communities in preserving and perpetuating Hopi culture. [210] SYMPOSIUM · CLOVIS CACHES: WINDOWS INTO EARLY PALEOINDIAN TECHNOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION AND LAND USE First recognized 45 years ago as a distinctive component of Clovis, caches of flaked stone and bone artifacts continue to be found and to fascinate archaeologists. While it is likely that caches reflect multiple behaviors ranging from ritual to mundane, they are united by offering glimpses of artifacts set aside at early stages in their histories of use. These papers focus on both recently discovered caches and current research on more familiar caches, offering new insights into Clovis lithic technological organization, mobility and land use patterns, and the colonization of late Pleistocene North America. [211] SYMPOSIUM · NEW DISCUSSIONS ON SOUTHERN NEVADA ARCHAEOLOGY The session brings together archaeologists who study the prehistory and history of southern Nevada and nearby regions. Information about on-going research, recent discoveries, and innovative approaches set the stage for discussions, promote interest in the region, and help to frame future investigations. Following the presentations, our discussant will lead an open forum in which participants may join in. [212] SYMPOSIUM · SHIFTING FROM OBJECT-CENTERED RESEARCH TO PEOPLE-FOCUSED APPLICATION: CURRENT APPROACHES TO PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY FROM LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN - PART II Despite the countless advancements in our scholarly understandings of prehispanic cultures and societies, this knowledge is not often actively shared with or presented to the local peoples, with whom archaeologists work in the field to obtain the data on which our interpretations are based. Certainly this is not always the case, as attested to by the growing awareness that is manifested in the projects and programs that exist, whose primary aims are to include and integrate local people in the process of creating and applying archaeological knowledge. [213] GENERAL SESSION · SUBSISTENCE, RITUAL, AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION IN THE DESERT SOUTHWEST

[214] SYMPOSIUM · CURRENT RESEARCH ON ISOTOPIC ANALYSES IN ARCHAEOLOGY AND ZOOARCHAEOLOGY Isotopic Analyses continue to provide insights into past human behavior. Archaeologists use isotopic data from both human and non-human animals to address a wide range of questions including how humans interact with their environment, changes in subsistence, climate change and adaptation, seasonality and astral mobility, and social and political organization. [215] SYMPOSIUM · THE CENTER FOR AMERICAN ARCHEOLOGY (CAA): CURRENT RESEARCH AND EDUCATION Grounded in a rich history of cutting edge research and education, programs at the CAA continue to inspire generations of students and scholars. This symposium highlights a suite of ongoing CAA programs including fieldwork at the Woodland Period Mound House site and the historic African-American community of Rocky Fork, macrobotanical and starch analyses of Archaic material from the multi-component Koster site, geomorphology of Koster landscapes and related landforms, constructing a baseline for current lead pollution studies, a historic images database project directed toward environmental research, and award winning programs in archaeological and environmental education for students of all ages. [216] SYMPOSIUM · UNDERSTANDING THE USES OF GROUND STONE TOOLS: NEW DIRECTIONS AND DEVELOPMENTS This symposium brings together the results of new research aimed at improving our understanding of ground stone tool use. Ground stone is one of the major components of the archaeological record worldwide. Four main strands of investigation are considered including experimental, ethnoarchaeological, use-wear, and organic residue studies. These strands are contextualized within an overview of the significance and current status of ground stone studies in Old and New World archaeology. Initiatives to improve web-based digital data sharing among ground stone researchers are also discussed. [217] GENERAL SESSION · WOODLAND AND MISSISSIPPIAN PERIOD RESEARCH IN THE SOUTHEASTERN US [218] SYMPOSIUM · AMONG THE MAYA AND THEIR NEIGHBORS: PAPERS IN HONOR OF E. WYLLYS ANDREWS V, PART II Links from the Maya heartland extend in all directions. In this session, the Maya experience is reexamined by present and former students of E. Wyllys Andrews, V. A range of theoretical vantage points are presented, focusing on recent advances in ceramic analysis, household and landscape archaeology. The dialogue about Maya political organization continues with the development of complex society under scrutiny. Models and data come from excavation, survey, ethnohistory and personal reminiscence at Copan, sites in Belize, El Salvador and even further afield. [219] GENERAL SESSION · ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE HISTORIC PERIOD: NORTHEAST, SOUTHEAST AND MIDWEST [220] SYMPOSIUM · COMBAT IN THE GRASS: DIVERSE PLANS OF ATTACK FOR WARFARE STUDIES OF THE NORTH AMERICAN GREAT PLAINS, PART 2 Research on warfare has a long-standing tradition in the Great Plains, with topics as diverse as the region itself. Recent archaeological studies of armed conflict during the precontact and early contact periods have focused on such diverse data as fortification systems, demographics, human skeletal remains, rock art, and resource availability. Challenging the dueling stereotype of the Plains Indian as ruthless warrior and peaceable ecologist, papers in this symposium reveal a complex mix of ritual warfare, territorial disputes, plunder, and taking of captives for trade and to rebuild local populations following epidemics. [221] SYMPOSIUM · OBSIDIAN REFLECTIONS: EXAMINING THE SYMBOLIC AND RITUAL DIMENSIONS OF OBSIDIAN FOR INTERPRETING THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD OF ANCIENT MESOAMERICA Over the past 20 years, Mesoamerican scholars have begun to more

ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 75TH ANNIVERSARY MEETING

deeply explore the meaningful associations of obsidian in terms of ideology, world view, religion, and social life. Nonetheless, much of this work has remained largely divorced from interpretations of archaeological patterns of obsidian procurement, distribution and consumption. In this symposium, participants will assess the degree to which obsidian's symbolic and religious connotations may have affected decision making in the selection, trade and utilization of obsidian in Mesoamerica. [222] SYMPOSIUM · CARAVANNING ACROSS THE AMERICAS: RESEARCH INSPIRED BY THE WORK AND MENTORSHIP OF DAVID L. BROWMAN This session is dedicated to the archaeology and ideas of David L. Browman. Browman has conducted archaeological research in North and South America since 1963 and has mentored many PhD, Master's, and undergraduate students during his nearly 40-year tenure at Washington University in St. Louis. This collection of papers represents: 1) current research building upon themes he advanced in the Andean region of South America (camelid pastoralism, iconography, Formative and Tiwanaku periods) and 2) research throughout the Americas that was inspired by his academic mentorship (craft production, paleoethnobotany, historical ecology, and peopling of the Americas). [223] SYMPOSIUM · CELEBRATING A DECADE OF DISCOVERY, ARCHAEOLOGY, HERITAGE EDUCATION, AND OUTREACH ON THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT'S NATIONAL LANDSCAPE CONSERVATION SYSTEM In the ten years since the creation of the National Landscape Conservation System, the Bureau of Land Management, its partners, and researchers have created a body of work that has contributed to the science of archaeology and a better understanding of BLM resources; BLM has been a leader in Native American involvement in planning, research, and outreach; and broadened the field of heritage education. This symposium explores the strides that have been made and the steps for the future. [224] SYMPOSIUM · HUMAN RESPONSES TO YOUNGER DRYAS IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE: THE NEW WORLD (SPONSORED BY INTERNATIONAL QUATERNARY ASSOCIATION (INQUA)) Whatever its causes, the abrupt, sharp Younger Dryas climatic event (ca. 11-10.2 kya uncal.) was a major reversal of the warming trend that had been underway since the beginning of the Late Glacial Interstadial, with all the consequences this had for regional habitability, vegetation and fauna. This symposium will explore whether, to what extent and how specifically humans may have responded to environmental and resources changes in terms of their distributions, mobility patterns, subsistence strategies, technologies, social relations and even belief systems in North America. Speakers will present specific case studies and syntheses from particularly well-studied regions of the continent. [225] SYMPOSIUM · MEMORY, MATERIALITY, AND ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE INDIGENOUS AMERICAS Objects, bodies, places, and landscapes have increasingly become important in archaeological research in regards to the time transcendent role they have in social memory. Serving as points of active social engagement in processes of re/creation, re/appropriation, and conflict/resolution the significance of these material expressions allows archaeologists to develop deeper understandings of the processes in which continuities, transformations and discontinuities occur. Yet these processes are not simply an issue for past understandings but may also inform present interactions. Focusing on Indigenous communities in the Americas, this session explore these processes and their significance to both past understandings and contemporary archaeological practice. [226] GENERAL SESSION · MORTUARY ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE AMERICAS

[227] FORUM · ETHICAL ISSUES IN GLOBAL ARCHAEOLOGY (SPONSORED BY COMMITTEE ON ETHICS AND THE REGISTER OF PROFESSIONAL ARCHAEOLOGISTS) The Forum's goal is to expand discussion of ethical issues in archaeology from a global perspective. Archaeologists grapple with issues including relationships with descendent communities, commercialization of archaeology, and looting and vandalism, among others. How do these issues affect practice outside the US? Which issues matter most to those working or educated in other countries? How do the relationships between archaeologists and descendent/local communities differ globally? How do ethical issues of commercialization vary? In an increasingly globalized world, in archaeology and in life, it is valuable to gain a broader understanding of ethical issues that arise in different archaeological contexts. [228] SYMPOSIUM · ENGINEERING MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPES: AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF SOCIAL INVESTMENT Since the early Holocene, humans have occupied mountain environments and relied on mountain resources throughout the North American continent. We explore the archaeology of mountain dwellers and habitual users of high-elevation resources as representative of "social investment." Social investment, or the intergenerational commitment of individuals and groups to particular landscape uses, left material imprints that are archaeologically visible in unique ways, from anthropogenic fires to vision quest sites. However subtle or definitive, heartlands or hinterlands, engineered landscapes found in remote locales and seemingly inaccessible mountains, in principle, should reflect both the fully intended and unintended consequences of social investment. [229] SYMPOSIUM · VALLEYS OF STONE, RIVERS OF JADE: NEW INVESTIGATIONS ALONG THE ANCIENT MAYA WESTERN EXCHANGE ROUTES AND IMPLICATIONS FOR POLITICAL ECONOMY AND TRADE The northern Verapaz and southern Pasion valley and river system formed a principal exchange route for the ancient Maya world, connecting highlands and lowlands, linking the valleys to the Pasion and Chixoy lowland river highways and intersecting with the eastwest Caribbean-to-Mexico "transversal". These routes transported to Maya cities not only obsidian and salt, but their most precious sacred goods, including Pacific shell, pyrite, quetzal plumage and, above all, jade. Yet this critical region has remained virtually unstudied. Now recent international projects and findings, described here, are changing our understandings of ancient Maya production, exchange, and political economy. [230] SYMPOSIUM · THREE DIMENSIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL MODELING: NEW DIRECTIONS IN RESEARCH, METHODOLOGY AND THEORY Three dimensional site/artifact modeling draws much attention in the field of archaeology. Advances in technology are opening this field up in new and exciting ways. The benefits of these models for presentation to a general audience are apparent, however, how these new and evolving technologies are being used to enhance academic research is less so? Moving beyond aesthetic modeling this session looks at how 3D models are creating testable interfaces. Papers will present various uses of three dimensional models to answer research questions; as well as comment on the methodological and theoretical developments that come with these developing analytical techniques. [231] SYMPOSIUM · CURRENT INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES TO NORTH-CENTRAL TEXAS PREHISTORY Recent interdisciplinary investigations along the upper Trinity River within north-central Texas have shed new light on geoarchaeology, subsistence patterns, paleoenvironment and chronology for the region.

[233] POSTER SESSION · GEOPHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA Undergraduate and graduate students from Indiana University of Pennsylvania have conducted research during this past year on historic and prehistoric sites in western Pennsylvania using a variety of geophysical instruments. Through this research we have gained new insights into the regional archaeology as well as much experience in the use of the instruments. This session provides examples of our research and results. [234] POSTER SESSION · LARGE GAME PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES [235] POSTER SESSION · WHAT'S NEW IN SOUTHWESTERN ARCHAEOLOGY? [236] GENERAL SESSION · PALEOINDIAN, ARCHAIC & LITHIC STUDIES IN THE SOUTHEASTERN US [237] SYMPOSIUM · MODALITIES OF VALUE(S): EXPRESSIONS OF HERITAGE IN CURRENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIALOGUE (SPONSORED BY HERITAGE VALUES INTEREST GROUP) The language used to describe, label, and conceive of (in)tangible archaeological heritage fluctuates with changing modalities of value. This session confronts issues of "value" that are increasingly significant in the representation of past material objects, landscapes, and cultures. It offers perspective on the ascription of value: How is heritage value attributed, recognized, and/or officially endorsed? By whom? What occurs when values do not cohere? Session participants pose these and other questions in addressing why an understanding of heritage--and of how value is ascribed--within differing cultural contexts is fundamental to current archaeological dialogue. [238] FORUM · SAVING THE PLANET . . . AND ARCHAEOLOGY! (SPONSORED BY PUBLIC EDUCATION COMMITTEE) More than a decade ago, adult natural resource education and volunteer service programs began with the Texas Master Naturalists. Since then, thousands of participants in 35 states began volunteering in similar programs. Panelists in this forum will describe how they incorporate archaeology into natural resource programs. Along with teaching the volunteers, we need to work with professional managers, some of who view archaeological site preservation as an impediment to restoration efforts. This session will involve panelists and the audience in discussing approaches to working with local to national-level environmental stewards, an audience that is vital for the future of public archaeology. [239] GENERAL SESSION · NEW PERSPECTIVES ON MISSISSIPPIAN IN THE GREATER CAHOKIA SPHERE [240] SYMPOSIUM · SEARCHING FOR STRUCTURE IN CERAMIC ANALYSIS: APPLYING MULTI-SCALAR FRAMEWORKS AND TECHNIQUES TO THE INVESTIGATION OF POTTERY PRODUCTION This session is intended to provoke thinking about ceramic structure--specifically, the analytical relevance of structure to the study of production and the necessary instrumentation for such investigation. By re-examining pottery structure from micro-, meso-, and macro-scales, the participants support the idea that the analysis of formation techniques, firing procedures, and decorative technologies can significantly contribute to the holistic analysis of past ceramic economies. When coupled with innovative instrumental techniques, this approach generates detailed ceramic production data that serve as a full and rich partner to the exchange dynamics illuminated by various forms of compositional analysis. [241] SYMPOSIUM · PALEODEMOGRAPHY: ADVANCES AND NEW TRENDS IN AGRICULTURAL POPULATION IN MESOAMERICA As a demographic subdiscipline, paleodemography includes a variety of phenomenon of concern to archaeology, physical anthropology, ethnohistory, and human ecology. This session reconnects the archaeological phenomenon of population with its demographic baggage, at the same time encouraging uses of

paleodemographic information from different disciplines for a better comprehension of agricultural populations of the past in Mesoamerica. Through this perspective, papers deal with topics such as the size and distribution of ancient populations, as well as their origins, migration patterns, and resource use. They also compare the results of different sampling techniques or methods of demographic analysis within the study of agricultural populations in Mesoamerica. [242] SYMPOSIUM · LANDSCAPE LANDMARKS AS SOCIAL AGENTS Most of the time the landscape has been understood as a space, with a symbolic content. This does no more than reproduce the Cartesian division between object and subject. It is necessary to look toward traditional societies where a defined separation of it doesn't exist. Animals, plants, rocks or mountains can be understood as part of the social world. So the landscape is the thing that structures the human action and at the same time is structured by it. This session will present works of theoretical reflections on landscape, identity and agency, as well as practical applications. [243] SYMPOSIUM · NEW APPROACHES IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF MEDIEVAL EUROPE This session highlights contemporary research projects being conducted on the archaeology of medieval Europe (c. AD 500-1500). Medieval archaeology is experiencing a renaissance of innovative, sophisticated theoretical and methodological approaches, thanks to a new generation of scholars who are drawing on a variety of models from the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. The overall goal of this session is to bring medieval archaeologists into greater communion with the wider American archaeological/anthropological community, by showcasing the groundbreaking work being done in the Middle Ages by scholars from both the US and Europe. [244] SYMPOSIUM · PAPERS IN HONOR OF WILLIAM S. DANCEY The papers in this session are presented in honor of Dr. William S. Dancey, who recently retired after a distinguished career of over 30 years in the Department of Anthropology at The Ohio State University. The session participants represent a selection of Dancey's Ph.D. students. The papers reflect the theoretical, methodological, and empirical influence which Dancey imparted upon us as archaeology students at OSU. Dancey concludes the session with comments and a discussion of how he sees it all "fitting together". [245] SYMPOSIUM · RECENT ADVANCES IN THE ZOOARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LAKE TITICACA BASIN The waters and surrounding high plains of the Lake Titicaca Basin have recently become the geographic focus for a number of zooarchaeological specialists. Data derived by these researchers contribute to a diachronic understanding of human-animal interaction from the Archaic Period to the Late Horizon. Papers in this session will explore various modes of primary and secondary resource extraction for subsistence and ritual activities. This symposium provides unique opportunities to discuss the role of terrestrial, aquatic, and avian species in the development of social complexity within a discrete region. [246] SYMPOSIUM · SETTLEMENT PATTERNS OF VIKING AGE ICELAND: THE METHODS AND RESULTS OF THE SKAGAFJORDUR ARCHAEOLOGICAL SETTLEMENT SURVEY The Skagafjordur Archaeological Settlement Survey (SASS) has developed and refined methods to complete a survey of Viking Age and Medieval farmsteads over a small area of Northern Iceland. The subsurface survey employed coring, electromagnetics, and test pits to identify, date, and assess the settlements. Several farmsteads were selected for resistivity, GPR, and excavation. In this symposium we will outline the methods and results. We find that the end of the Viking Age in Iceland is marked by a change from widely spaced self-sufficient farms to a mosaic of manors and dependent farmsteads, suggestive of the transition from chiefdom to state.

ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 75TH ANNIVERSARY MEETING

[247] GENERAL SESSION · ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE EASTERN UNITED STATES [248] SYMPOSIUM · BEING OR BECOMING? LATE HOLOCENE RESEARCH ON FORAGERS AND EARLY FARMERS IN THE DESERT WEST The US Southwest and Great Basin share environmental characteristics, including aridity, topographic variability, and widely distributed resources. At a broad scale, much of their archaeological record is similar, too; featuring long periods of mobile foraging and an uneven incorporation of farming into the suite of subsistence strategies. Despite these commonalities, regional archaeologists often employ different approaches to examine prehistoric lifeways. The papers in this session emphasize new theoretical perspectives and methods to examine Late Holocene foragers and early farmers across the arid West, with the hope of stimulating dialogue among western archaeologists. [249] SYMPOSIUM · BEYOND THE MINIMUM, CONTRIBUTIONS TO ARCHEOLOGY Many archeologists work for the government or as private contractors. They provide a specific service as part of their job, often this does not require much in original research; however, many exceed their job requirements. They provide useful cultural resource research, going beyond the minimum required by their job. This symposium illustrates and recognizes their work. [250] SYMPOSIUM · COASTAL SEASONALITY: METHODOLOGIES AND SUBSTANTIVE APPLICATIONS Archaeologists working in coastal settings typically recover multiple biological proxies for human seasonal behavior. Questions of archaeological seasonality are uniquely linked to settlement patterns, resource availability, environmental relationships, landscapes, and social complexity, such as: Why is seasonality important to the study of human behavior? What does this knowledge tell us about life in dynamic estuarine systems? What methodologies are available to address fundamental questions? Papers in this symposium will discuss methodologies appropriate for assessing seasonality in common biological proxies and substantive applications with particular reference to the archaeology of St. Catherines Island and the Georgia Bight (USA). [251] SYMPOSIUM · CURRENT RESEARCH ON THE POVERTY POINT CULTURE In the last few years archaeologists have conducted a wide range of new field and laboratory research on the Poverty Point culture. This includes excavations at the Poverty Point site and Jaketown, remote sensing of plaza and ridge features at Poverty Point, and a variety of analyses of lithics, ceramics, poverty point objects, and other artifacts. This symposium will present the results of these studies and discuss their implications for new understandings of one of the most important and renowned archaeological complexes in North America. [252] Symposium · Lessons Learned and Advances Made: Looking Back Over the New York State Millennium Pipeline Project, 1997-2009 At inception, the Millennium Pipeline required one of the largest corridor surveys ever completed in the northeast. Millennium understands the value of these studies and reaches out to the professional community with the results of over a decade of work encompassing the prehistory and history of New York's southern tier. This session is diachronic, beginning with the methods and models employed in the archaeological survey, progressing to detailed information gained from the project about historical development, cultural landscapes, and the environment, and culminating in the management and dissemination of public information at project's end. [253] SYMPOSIUM · ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ARIZONA STRIP Archaeological evidence indicates that the Arizona Strip was heavily

utilized in prehistoric times, most notably by farmers associated with the Virgin and Kayenta puebloan traditions. Despite its rich archaeological heritage, the area remains one of the most understudied areas in U.S. Southwestern archaeology. This situation is beginning to change, largely as a result of several field schools and other large-scale projects during the last a few years. Using information obtained from these projects, this symposium explores such questions as, interaction of the Arizona Strip occupants with adjacent populations, the role of long-distance exchange in the area, and the subsistence strategies. [254] SYMPOSIUM · REGIONAL AND INTERREGIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE MEXICAN GULF COAST The Mexican Gulf Coast possesses a rich, diverse cultural heritage. The cultural traditions and historical trajectories of the area provide important information concerning regional and interregional socioeconomic trends across Mesoamerica. This symposium covers a broad geographic range from the Northern Huasteca to the Southern Gulf Lowlands, spanning the Formative period to the Early Colonial period. Recent projects contribute new insights into Classic period political organization, Postclassic period economic development, and Colonial period interregional interaction. These studies add to our broader understanding of state formation, diverse regional political forms, and local impacts of social and technological changes. [255] SYMPOSIUM · TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATIONS ON THE COLONIAL FRONTIER: NEW WORLD CONTACT AND EARLY HISTORIC PERIOD TECHNOLOGIES OF INDIGENOUS AND HISTORIC POPULATIONS New World Colonial exploration and expansion generated new cultural interactions within and between Native Americans and Europeans. The transference and transformation of technologies was an important component of these interactions. European goods (metals, glass, high-fired ceramics, etc.) were introduced to native populations, and these native groups modified new materials for specific purposes and often attempted to learn and adapt new transformative technologies (e.g., smelting and metalworking). Symposium participants will present new data illuminating and contextualizing the technological, social and economic conditions of the use, adoption, adaptation and spread of new materials and their associated technologies in the New World. [256] SYMPOSIUM · RECOGNIZING SKILL-LEVEL AND WHAT IT REVEALS CULTURALLY ARCHAEOLOGICALLY

The recognition of how skillfully material culture is manipulated has tremendous implications for how we interpret the archaeological record. Are two objects two distinct types, or the same type produced by a master and novice? Do broad technological changes through time reflect an increased ability to skillfully manipulate material mediums? Can archaeological skill-level recognition lead to broader inquiries such as the identification of individuals and their age, socio-economic status, or social grouping? These are just a few of the questions the contributors in this symposium will examine, while also attempting to formulate how to recognize skill in different material mediums. [257] SYMPOSIUM · IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF GLENN BLACK: NEW RESEARCH AT THE ANGEL SITE The Angel site (12VG1), a Mississippian town on the Ohio River near Evansville, Indiana, is best known through the important work of Glenn Black, published posthumously in 1967. New research undertaken during the past few decades has greatly expanded our understanding of the site. This research includes studies of ceramic seriation and technology, geophysical mapping of buildings and the interior of mounds, an enhanced and more detailed site occupation history based on AMS dating of structures and earthworks, isotopic and DNA studies of the Angel people and, finally, several years of excavation of structures that spanned occupation at the site.

[258] SYMPOSIUM · ON THE VALLEY FLOOR: REGIONAL VARIATION AND CULTURAL DIFFERENCE IN SOUTHEAST MESOAMERICA The Ulua, Chamelecon, and Motagua rivers carve out extensive valleys where ancient Southeast Mesoamerican cultures flourished. While their inhabitants share elements of construction techniques, architectural forms, and artifact assemblages, there is considerable variation: sites with Copan-style Maya characteristics alongside centers with local architectural canons; settlement sizes ranging from 15 to over 450 structures; and widespread ceramic systems where design elements are re-worked to suit local ideals. This session explores these contrasts, comparing landscape use, ceramic production, storage, architecture, and intra- and inter-site planning patterns during the Late and Terminal Classic periods with an eye to their implications for socio-political practice. [259] SYMPOSIUM · GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH (SPONSORED BY GEOARCHAEOLOGY INTEREST GROUP) The interface between the earth sciences and archaeology encompasses a plethora of research avenues, the pursuit of which has enriched both fields. This session is intended as a forum for researchers in all aspects of geoarchaeology (geochronology, soil science, materials science, sourcing, taphonomy, geomorphology, etc.) working in any region or any time period to share results and methodologies. [260] SYMPOSIUM · COSTUME, DRESS, AND ORNAMENT IN FORMATIVE PERIOD MESOAMERICA AND THE ISTHMO-COLOMBIAN ZONE This session considers aspects of dress, adornment, and ritual costume among the Formative period cultures of ancient Mesoamerica and adjacent areas. It was during this period that many of the costuming practices of this region originated; however, this topic has not yet been addressed synthetically in Precolumbian archaeology or art history. The papers in this session consider a variety of issues relating to this topic including the reconstruction of clothing and non-fabric ornamentation practices, their symbolic dimensions, and aesthetics. These topics are interrogated through case studies that focus on particular sub-regions, sites, monuments, or individuals known through the archaeological record.

ABSTRACTS OF INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS Abbott, David (Arizona State University) and Katherine Spielmann (Arizona State Univ.) [100] Alliance and Landscape on Perry Mesa, Central Arizona Compelling evidence for endemic warfare has been documented in many areas of the Southwest. Among them is the Verde Confederacy, described as a highly coordinated alliance that encompassed much of central Arizona. In the late 1200s, pueblos were built above the sheer cliffs of Perry Mesa and overlooking access routes onto the mesa top. Was this migration a strategic deployment to create an integrated castle defense atop the mesa and bolster the western flank of the confederacy? Or did climatic change attract migrants to a landscape with improved agricultural capacity? Multiple lines of evidence are mustered to evaluate these ideas. [100] First Organizer; [100] First Chair Abrams, Elliot [30] see Weaver, Sarah A.; [241] see Freter-Abrams, AnnCorinne Abramson, Corey [181] see Modzelewski, Darren Acuna, Mary Jane (Washington University in St. Louis), Carlos Chiriboga (Yale University), Marcello Canuto (Tulane University) and Tomas Barrientos (Universidad del Valle) [54] Outlier, Port of Trade, or What? New Preclassic evidence from El Achiotal in Western Peten, Guatemala Little is known about the Preclassic in the western Maya Peten lowlands. Recent research at the site of El Achiotal begins to shed light on this important time period, when early Maya states were emerging. Unlike many Preclassic sites in the central Peten lowlands, El Achiotal does not fit within the pattern. Its distinct features and its location suggest the center played a significant role with other regions to the west. Its individuality also raises questions about the archaeological understanding of the central Peten lowland Preclassic Maya. Adair, Mary (University of Kansas), Donna C. Roper (Kansas State University) and Jack L. Hofman (University of Kansas) [72] Pawnee Life and Technology at 1800: A Perspective from the Kansas Monument site, 14RP1 The interrelated systems of material culture, technology, economy, group interactions, gender roles and status changes are variously expressed in the archaeological record of the Pawnee during the contact and fur trade period. Many traditions apparently persisted, perhaps in modified form, through this period of change, others may have been greatly modified or lost completely. We address the potential relationships between technological changes and other aspects of Pawnee life using material culture from the Kansas Monument site (14RP1) to explore the implications for changes in value systems, status differentiation, gender roles, social organization, and intertribal relationships. Adam, Jagich [184] see Kindler, Lutz Adams, Christopher D. [42] see Big Owl-McArdle, Germaine F. Adams, E. (University of Arizona) [128] Termination Ritual and Migration at Chevelon Pueblo, Arizona This paper explores the material patterns of structure and village abandonment of the ancient Hopi village, Chevelon Pueblo, located on the Little Colorado River in northeastern Arizona. Excavation of 8% of the structures of the 500-room village revealed repeated and extensive practices of structural burning and object placement related to abandonment of individual structures and of the village as a whole. These patterns are discussed in terms of individual, household, and corporate ritual practices. It is argued that these practices are part of lengthy Pueblo tradition related to closure or termination practices associated with long distance migration. [110] Discussant Adams, Jenny (Desert Archaeology, Inc.) [40] Editing Kiva: 75 years of Past Participles and Future Tense Some of the biggest names in southwestern archaeology began their careers as KIVA editors. In the early days of KIVA, most editors were graduate students in the Anthropology Department at the University of Arizona. Since 1935, the size, complexity, and stature of KIVA has grown, as have the responsibilities of the Editor. It now requires several people to shepherd an issue through, from article acquisition to final production. This poster outlines the progression of editors with commentaries from some about their tenure, the issues-of-their day, and their vision for the journal. [216] Discussant Adams, Kenneth [224] see Goebel, Ted Adelsberger, Katherine (Knox College), Benjamin W. Porter (University of California, Berkeley), Bruce Routledge (University of Liverpool), and Danielle S. Fatkin (Knox College) [259] Geoarchaeology at Dhiban: Research Potentials of a Multiperiod Site in Central Jordan The multiperiod site of Dhiban, west-central Jordan, is situated on the semi-arid Dhiban Plateau. Remains from the Iron Age, Classical, and Islamic periods indicate prolonged habitation despite environmental challenges due to limited water availability as well as probable environmental degradation, as indicated by evidence of slope erosion and stabilization measures. Cisterns and a small wadi system provided the only water sources throughout Dhiban`s occupation, making agriculture a challenging prospect and water-catchment a necessity. Geoarchaeological approaches to understanding the influence of these environmental stresses on populations at Dhiban provide the most promising avenues of investigation into humanenvironment interactions in this region. Adelsberger, Katherine [92] see Fatkin, Danielle S; Adkins, Larry (Cerritos College, Norwalk, California) and Robert A. Benfer (University of Missouri) [89] Lunar Standstill Phenomena at the Preceramic Buena Vista Site in Perú We have previously reported lunar standstill alignments from the site of Buena Vista, Perú. Two principle observing centers in the complex are aligned with horizon markers, which identify the onset of the major southern standstill seasons. Here new data show there is an alignment from the temple entryway stairs to the highest nearby mountain peak (Apu) which also correlates well with the extreme limit of the major standstill azimuth. The results are consistent with both a flat horizon moonrise and the "visible" moonrise over a ridge line which blocks off approximately 26° of the eastern sky. Adler, Michael (Southern Methodist University) [128] You`re Fired: Abandonment Signatures in Ancestral Pueblo Village Contexts This paper reviews the diversity of abandonment signatures from a northern Rio Grande pueblo, Pot Creek Pueblo, with a focus on destructive burning. Archaeological models of site abandonment tend to particularize strategies of site occupants, but we can`t lose sight of forces outside the control of those occupants. This paper expands considerations of prehistoric practice to include physical parameters modeling cultural practices and natural forces. Evidence at Pot Creek Pueblo supports a relatively brief, possibly violent set of "burning events" involving domestic and ritual architecture associated with the demise of occupation, followed by a period of scavenging and artifact recycling.

at Meadowcroft Rockshelter, Washington County, Pennsylvania. Beginning in the 1980s, these same protocols --collectively subsumed under the rubric forensic sedimentology--were applied in a succession of successful ARPA prosecutions. The ability to essentially fingerprint sediments was a critical element in all of the cases, which included both open and closed archaeological loci. Highlights of past cases are presented and current descriptive/analytical methodologies are discussed. New developments in instrumentation are also detailed in terms of their applicability to future cases. [90] see Illingworth, Jeff Aguero Reyes, Adriana (Independent) [260] Stone or Clay?: The Significance of Power Elements in the Olmec Ballgame Attire Iconography The ballgame is one of the most important ritual events in ancient Mesoamerica. This paper discusses the sociopolitical importance of ballgame in Olmec society. We will review the iconographic elements that identify ballplayer attire and analyze their context to interpret the ritual. In Classic period Mesoamerica, ballplayers are considered to have been high ranking individuals, but during the Formative, ballplayers were also represented in clay figurines, a medium generally related to the domestic context in Mesoamerican archaeology. Depending on the medium and the context, we can interpret the sociopolitical importance of ballgame in different, contrasting ways. Aguilar, Ana (Ecodesarrollo Papagayo S.A.) and Elisa Fernández León (Universidad de Costa Rica) [191] Questioning the Historical Sources from a Linguistic and Archaeological Perspective in Lower Central America In 16th century Pacific Nicaragua, languages from the Mesoamerican and Isthmo-Columbian linguistic areas were spoken. We believe the stories regarding migration have a strong historical basis; however, there hasn't been an agreement among the archaeologists regarding the fact that these historical descriptions reflect the actual reality of the archaeological societies or if what Kirchhoff once suggested about Pacific Nicaragua being a part of Mesoamerica is true. Here we conduct a conceptual exercise, using already documented cases from Northeastern Costa Rica and Pacific Nicaragua, to present an interpretative model of how this process could have taken place.

An expanded site sample was analyzed using finer temporal ranges to determine if Dalton components correlated better with early or late Early Archaic period segments. Assuming that environmental changes provide the impetus for settlement pattern shifts, the correlations provide information about the timing of changes in resource distributions and use of the Early Archaic landscape. A shift in settlement locations to valley margins that characterizes the Middle Archaic period may have started in the late Early Archaic.

The Lake Pátzcuaro Basin Archaeological Project. Aimers, Jim (SUNY Geneseo) [218] Stockholm Syndrome and Maya Archaeology When I arrived at Tulane in 1992 I was obsessed by Maya architecture and planned to write a interdisciplinary dissertation on that topic. By 1996 that dream had been crushed by the Department of Anthropology and I realized that to graduate from Tulane I would have to find another topic. Unexpected Postclassic period finds at Baking Pot, Belize, sparked my interest in ceramics and since then most of my research has been about Maya ceramics. In this paper I discuss some current debates and approaches in Maya ceramic analysis with reference to the work of E. Wyllys Andrews.

Examining the Susquehanna crossing sites through phased resource assessments afforded an opportunity for staging geoarchaeological research within the structure of the CRM process. This cross section provides an important connection between the better understood segments of the basin further upstream and segments located downstream along Upper Main Stem of the Susquehanna Basin.

The examples also shed light on impacts of Binford's work on archaeological scenes of East Asia, especially in Japan. Ambivalent relations between the processual archaeology and historical orientation of archaeology there are discussed. The theoretical standpoint of technological organizations would alleviate inadequacy in use-wear research strategy which has been influenced by "behavioral reconstruction schools" since 1970s. Observed usewear traces must be recognized as palimpsest phenomena to understand cultural systems movements, rather than as traces from individual behavioral episodes.

This region, located to the east of the Titicaca Basin and nearby the tropical piedmonts, was an important node of interaction between two distinct environments. Based on a regional survey and excavations, we will present data showing the different ways in which Tiwanaku and the Inka sought to gain access to such valuable valleys, the nature of their control, and the complex relations that Inkas and Inkas-of-privilege from the Titicaca Basin maintained with the Kallawaya.

Aldeias, Vera (University of Pennsylvania), Dennis Sandgathe (Simon Fraser University), Harold Dibble (University of Pennsylvania), Paul Goldberg (Boston University) and Shannon Mcpherron (Max Planck Institute) [8] The Mousterian Combustion Features at Roc de Marsal Recent excavations have revealed numerous hearths in the lower levels of the sequence, especially in archaeological layers 7 and 9. These surprisingly well-preserved fire residues, rare in Mousterian contexts, are comprised of cm-thick lenticular features composed of couplets of ash resting on organic-rich substrates, which are between 20 cm up to ~100 cm across. Their detailed study in the field and in the lab (e.g., micromorphology, FTIR) can potentially provide important insights into past human activities and behavior. This paper outlines methods of excavation and documentation in the field and laboratory, and presents preliminary results about their possible uses. Aldenderfer, Mark (University of Arizona) [245] Animal utilization during the Late Archaic-Early Formative Transition: The Evidence from Jiskairumoko Faunal materials as well as complex archaeological features from Jiskairumoko during the Late Archaic-Early Formative transition (ca. 2200-1800 BCE) suggest the presence of herded, possibly domesticated, animals at this critical period. The evidence for this assertion is presented, and the implications of these data within a context of increasing sedentism and emerging sociopolitical complexity are explored. Alex, Lynn (University of Iowa) [238] Discussant Alexander, Rani (New Mexico State University) [178] Maya Collapse or Resilience? Lessons from the Spanish Conquest and Yucatan`s Caste War Recent calls to extricate the Maya from the stereotype of collapse have singled out cultural resilience as the viable new brand for the political present. In this paper I examine two episodes of Maya collapse and resilience in Yucatan-- the Spanish invasion (15111546) and the Caste War (1847-1901). I compare archaeological evidence of the strategies and resistances enacted before each catastrophe with those of the aftermath. My evidence suggests that some of the things the Maya did to survive, resist, and accommodate the Spanish colonial regime and Mexico`s 19th-century progressive agenda were similar to what they did before. Allard, Francis (Indiana University of Pennsylvania) [95] Discussant; [95] First Chair; [95] First Organizer Allen, Mark (California State Polytechnic University, Pomona) [127] Of Earth and Stone: Landscapes of Power in New Zealand and the Western Mojave Desert Lush, yet marginal by the standards of Polynesian horticulture, prehistoric New Zealand saw Maori chiefs` tactical and strategic use of terrain and earthwork fortifications to vie for political and economic influence. California`s Mojave Desert, arid and forbidding, offers cultural landscapes of greater time depth. More subtle, they nevertheless reveal hunter-gatherers` concerns with economics, fertility, and social power. Here, it is rock and stone that tell of place and power. Both regions have seen much archaeology, but usually with a focus on specific sites. It is argued that a contextual approach brings fresh insights to these contrasting natural and cultural landscapes. Allgood, Jessica [172] Analysis of Faunal Remains from the Carskadon Site (23LE348), a Middle Woodland Havana Hopewell Site in Lewis County, Missouri Significant Middle Woodland (Havana Hopewell) and minor Late Woodland occupations were represented at the Carskadon Site (23LE348). Of note from the recovered materials was a very large and remarkably well-preserved sample of faunal materials. The site offers a unique opportunity to better understand faunal subsistence activities from a Middle Woodland Havana Hopewell occupation, as

well as identifying shifts in subsistence behavior through time. This paper summarizes results of the faunal analysis and explores the Middle Woodland subsistence adaptation through comparison with contemporaneous sites in the region. Allison, James (Brigham Young University) [253] Puebloan Sites in the Hidden Hills In 2006 and 2007, the Brigham Young University Archaeological Field School worked in the Hidden Hills area of the Shivwits Plateau, in the western part of the Arizona Strip. The field school mapped, surface collected, and tested a number of Puebloan habitation sites dating from about A.D. 800 to the late 1200s. Architecture includes surface roomblocks, stand-alone circular structures, and pit structures, including one deep masonry-lined pit structure that may be a kiva. Ceramic analysis shows that the Hidden Hills residents participated in ceramic exchange networks encompassing other parts of the Arizona Strip as well as more distant places.

Preliminary estimates of Cahokia`s immigrant community size are provided. [15] First Chair; [225] see Buchanan, Meghan E. Altizer, Valerie (University of Tennessee, Glenn A.

Gourd Creek Cave underwent excavations in 1918 and the 1960s; however, these investigations did not undergo detailed analysis. A revisit revealed that it may be the center of a similar Late Woodland complex. Artifacts obtained in earlier excavations were analyzed to determine the cave`s cultural history and to better understand Ozark settlement. The placement of these complexes on the landscape may be a reflection of cosmological principles by which prehistoric peoples viewed their universe.

Alvarez, Jose (University of Arizona) [136] Art on Rejoneado Walls: Reexamining Symbolism, Expression, and Ideology Iconographic works of art (e.g., frescoes, sculptures or retablos), and other forms of colonial art during the seventeenth-eighteenth centuries suggest that the process of cultural interactions between Spaniards, missionaries, and indigenous peoples after European exploration of present-day central and northern Mexico and southern Arizona was gradual. A type of indigenous artwork that has not received the attention it merits is rejoneado panel art, also referred to as panel art, paneling, folk art, or rejoneado (Eckhart 1975:56-57; McAndrew 1965:190). Exploring whether rejoneado panel art is explained by the process of ethnogenesis and/or syncretism is the principal topic of this study. Amadio, Ayla (Southern Illinois University-Carbondale) [13] Ritual Use of Animals at Formative Period Tayata Zooarchaeology encompasses more than subsistence when it is used to study ritual activity including seasonal celebrations, feasting, funerary observances and autosacrifice. My analysis focused on faunal remains excavated from Early and Middle Formative contexts at the Mixteca Alta site of Tayata, Oaxaca, and comparisons with contemporary sites elsewhere in Mesoamerica. The context of nonexotic fauna provided insight into their use in rituals; when compared regionally, the patterned use of animals in Mesoamerica is pervasive. This study provides a more thorough understanding of the multidimensional utility of faunal analysis within Mesoamerican archaeology. Amador, Edgar [162] see Davis-Salazar, Karla L.

Masai pastoralists in southwest Kenya allow goats to breed anytime because their browsing diet is available all year. Mating of sheep is restricted to July and August in order to optimize access to fresh grass during gestation and weaning. Variation in enamel oxygen isotopes within teeth is controlled by rainfall, and can reflect seasonality of birth. Teeth of goats from one Masai herd show a nonmodal pattern of isotopic variation, reflecting birth in all seasons, while sheep teeth show a unimodal pattern, reflecting a single birth season. This method can be used to investigate prehistoric African caprine herd management strategies.

It is often associated with high levels of artisanship and extra-household exchange and consumption. Artifact replication and morphological and distributional analyses of large artifact assemblages recovered from three large contemporaneous Northwest Coast corporate households shows specialization in ground stone production in elite residential areas. The same tools are concentrated in lower status areas thought to be copper working locales. This consistency contrasts with other production emphases that vary from household to household. These patterns suggest the presence of embedded specialists. Amici, Randy [89] see Scardera, Francis

New Evidence from Vista Alegre Recent research by the Proyecto Costa Escondida at the coastal site of Vista Alegre has revealed surprising new data about the island`s earliest inhabitants. Current models of population movements during the Middle Preclassic have that the original ceramic producing populations moving into the northeast corner of the Yucatan from the west. Evidence for this is based on the similarities between ceramic traditions across the peninsula. The Middle Preclassic materials from Vista Alegre, however, present a more complex picture of these early population movements and show strong affinities to the Mamom tradition of the eastern Petén-Belize area. Amador, Julio (UNAM) and Julio Amador Bech [22] Self-images or Images Beyond the Self? Anthropomorphic Figures in the Rock Art of Northwestern Sonora The meaning of many rock art depictions belonging to disappeared cultures eludes us. In the main Trincheras rock art site of northwestern Sonora (La Proveedora-Cerro San José), while anthropomorphic figures are just 10 percent of all petroglyphs, they are nonetheless, intriguing: their corporal attitudes, gestures, apparent movement, and facial dispositions constitute a source of invaluable information about some of their potential cultural and symbolic meanings. As some specialists have attributed a shamanistic ritual origin to the figures, an origin that implies the representation of supernaturals, shamans` spirit helpers, visions of "the world beyond", we raise questions regarding these interpretations.

They are located in similar structures, have the same basic architectural configurations, and depict processional figures. However, variations in the clothing of the figures and objects accompanying them make them distinct enough to raise certain questions about their function within particular structures. An in-depth analysis reveals that they likely served symbolic purposes which refer to ancient Maya cosmology and rituals involving priests, warriors, and captives. Further, they likely demarcated sacred spaces that have historical relevance at the site. Anaya Hernandez, Armando (Universidad Autonoma De Campeche) and Lorraine A. Williams-Beck (Centro de Investigaciones Históricas y Sociales, Universidad Autónoma de Campeche) [241] Jaina: Gateway to the Underworld In this paper we postulate a series of hypotheses that reconsider fundamental aspects regarding the creation, function, and geographical location of Jaina during pre-Columbian times. Recent review of burial contexts and the number of individuals interred in them shows that the vast majority documented to date is infants and children placed in a fetal position, within large unslipped jars or alone and with few grave goods. These contexts tend to be found in terrainleveling platform fill, low platforms, and in close proximity to the ballcourt. While other authors have emphasized the nature of a high pressure demographical situation for the pre-Columbian residents there and in other surrounding areas within the Yucatan Peninsula as an answer to this problem, it would be a worthwhile endeavor to consider anther interpretation which revolves around a mythical them frequently found in Maya iconography. If this be the case, then the myth could have been restaged during specific annual time frames

(University of Massachusetts Amherst) [117] Scottish Space: A Multidisciplinary Approach Attempts to understand the rural transition of Scotland during the 18th and 19th centuries has been approached archaeologically, historically and geographically with research positioned mainly in the Highland and Island regions. I argue that space should be used as a critique to address the failure of researchers to incorporate the regional variation of Scotland in terms of the process of transition and is the common ground upon which multidisciplinary research should be carried out. I believe this involves exploring how populations in the past understood, created, and manipulated space as well as how present researchers have interpreted changing spatial dimensions.

Anderson, David (Tulane University) [178] The Middle Preclassic Ballgame: Yucatan and Beyond The Mesoamerican Ballgame is a subject that has received a great deal of attention by scholars, largely focusing on the game`s political and societal role amongst Classic and Postclassic period Mesoamerican cultures. Discussions of the game`s antiquity often focus simply on the oldest known Early Preclassic examples of ballcourt architecture, and assume the courts held a similar role as their later counterparts. Recent discoveries of more than 20 examples of Middle Preclassic ballcourts from Maya sites in Northwest Yucatan, Mexico, provide a new source of data on the early Mesoamerican ballgame and a new perspective on its societal role. Anderson, David (University of Tennessee) [61] The Development of Complex Society in Eastern North America: Lessons from Temperate Europe Complex societies characterized by cemeteries and elaborate ceremonialism were present in Eastern North America as far back as the terminal Pleistocene. The construction of massive mound complexes appeared in many areas in the Mid-Holocene, a tradition that persisted until contact. Unlike temperate Europe, domesticated animals were rare, and agricultural food production only became important late. While state societies like those in western South America and Mesoamerica did not develop in the East, most scholars believe they would have eventually. Indeed, some believe that a state did emerge briefly at Cahokia in the central Mississippi Valley around AD 1050.

His well-known distributional approach predicts that goods procured through marketplace exchange should be distributed homogeneously among household assemblages. In this paper, I explore the distribution of polychrome ceramics in the Tepeaca area. Tepeaca was the capital of an Aztec tributary province and site of an important prehispanic marketplace. The distribution of polychrome pottery within the survey area suggests that most households would have had access to polychromes through marketplace exchange during the Late Postclassic (AD 1200 ­ 1519).

The environmental data that I use comes from interdisciplinary collaboration with researchers studying palynology and Quaternary sea-level change, while my own research draws upon the geosciences, landscape archaeology, and anthropology. The ultimate outcome of developing detailed chronological models for each site is to describe the inhabitants` coping strategies from climatic impacts, related to changing sea-level and coastline conditions.

[103] El Análisis Espacial del Conjunto Monumental de Atzompa La presente ponencia versa sobre el análisis espacial del Conjunto Monumental de Atzompa, el cual, con su zona nuclear y área periférica, abarca casi la totalidad de la superficie del cerro El Bonete. Ubicado al Norte de la Plaza Principal de Monte Albán, sus constructores generaron conjuntos arquitectónicos monumentales, asociados a terrazas culturales, unidades habitacionales y áreas de acceso, en las laderas y estribaciones del mismo cerro, cuyas funciones probablemente fueron como área administrativa y puntos de observación hacia los valles. Andrefsky, William (Washington State University), Jennifer Ferris (Washington State University), Justin Williams (Washington State University) and Nathan Goodale (Hamilton College) [120] Geologic Context and Diagnostic Provenance of Chert Geochemical characterization of cherts has generally been ineffective for determining small scale provenance of tool-stone source locations. This is typically due to large scale formation ranges of cherts and multiple phases of genesis in submarine contexts. Recent geochemical characterizations of cherts in the Owyhee Uplands of southeastern Oregon and southern Idaho show promise for diagnostic source locational distinctions. Our study suggests that chert sources that originated as a result of localized volcanic venting through sedimentary parent materials result in reliable geochemical provenance. Differentiating between chert provenance will ultimately increase our knowledge of archaic peoples procurement patterns. Andrefsky Jr, William [232] see Fisher, Philip R.

This paper proposes a first diachronic understanding of the jade exchange systems in that region, based on geochemical information source analysis of Classic period jade found at three principal sites along this trade route (Cancuen, Tres Islas, and Seibal).

Soil rarity, elevation difference within 1km of the sites, underlying glacial settings, and soil drainage all show significance when the nine known sites are compared to the nine random points.

Second, many households appear to have produced their own finished bifaces. Third, an intensive bipolar technology was ultimately applied to many of the obsidian artifacts. Finally, the sources represented imply a measure of economic independence even after Calixtlahuaca became part of the empire.

But hard evidence for this trade has been lacking. This paper reviews the evidence for trade between the Aegean and the Black Seas prior to the Aegean Bronze Age, between 5000-3000 BC, with emphasis on the Usatovo culture in the Dniester-Danube steppe corridor, which seems to have been a center for such trade beginning 3300 BC.

This paper utilizes a modal approach to document the variability of production characteristics of a variety of major types and forms of Late Postclassic pottery assemblages from several Mayapan houselots. Domestic contexts come from neighborhoods near to and distant from the monumental center of the city. Most houses were inhabited by pottery consumers, although one pottery production houselot is represented. Metric and on-metric attributes of ceramic rims permit an evaluation of production standardization and variation in assemblages and types at different Mayapan residences.

Applegate, Darlene (Western Kentucky University) [244] Contemporary Archaeological Systematics: Perspectives from Kentucky Among the many things I learned from William Dancey is an appreciation for critical evaluation and application of archaeological units. Systematics is not just a theoretical endeavor. Systematics shapes the archaeologist`s formulation of research questions, selection of field methodologies, approach to artifact analysis, and, ultimately, data interpretation. In this paper, I consider the current state of archaeological systematics in Woodland research in Kentucky, focusing on Adena and Hopewell. Arakawa, Fumi [19] see DeFrank, Laura Arakawa, Fumiyasu (Crow Canyon Archaeological Center) and Jamie Merewether (Crow Canyon Archaeological Center) [235] Evaluating Chaco Influences in the Central Mesa Verde Region Using Material Culture Archaeologists have assumed that residents of the Mesa Verde region had a more open, frequent interaction with people outside during Chaco Phenomenon (A.D. 1050­1150), but that interaction declined afterward. To investigate this assumption, we compile several artifact types--non-local pottery and lithics, perishable materials, and ornaments--from solid contexts in the late Pueblo II, early Pueblo III, and late Pueblo III periods. Our null hypothesis is that these data support the common assumption about frequent trades during the late Pueblo II period; our alternative hypothesis is that residents of the region may have maintained their own tradition through time.

Arbuckle, Benjamin (Baylor University) [64] Producing, Distributing and Consuming Animals: Evidence for Emerging Complexity in Chalcolithic Anatolia In this paper we explore evidence for complexity within systems involved in the production, distribution and consumption of animal resources in Chalcolithic Anatolia. Although evidence for material differentiation within early and middle Chalcolithic communities is generally lacking faunal evidence suggests that animals may have been important symbols as well as sources of inequality in these early communities. The Early Chalcolithic animal economy therefore may represent a unique 'social theater' to which the expression of inequality, competition, and emerging complexity were confined prior to their expression in other types of material culture in the later Chalcolithic.

Fieldwork led to the discovery of five Late and Terminal Classic settlements sharing spatial and artifactual features. Topographic mapping, surveys and surface collecting allowed us to reveal a cultural portrait of an area that used to remain blank on the Maya world maps. An extensive rescue digging exposed a funerary complex of simple pit burials that probably connect to the phenomena usually referred to as the collapse.

This paper discusses the results, methods, and theoretical underpinnings of an archaeological project on late pre-Columbian hillforts in southern Peru. Several seasons of survey and mapping have given fruitful information about conflict and political process in the region. The project has also made fundamental assumptions about the rationality of past populations at war, for instance in the use of GIS analysis, which implicitly privileges environmental over cultural factors. I discuss this and alternative visions of pre-Columbian warfare, and speculate on the ways we arrive at them. [220] Discussant; [127] see Plourde, Aimee M.

It is thus of major significance for Nicaraguan and regional archaeology. Charcoal paint samples from some of the images in the cave have thus far produced radiocarbon dates spanning from ~1200 B.P. to ~300 B.P. Rock art motif comparisons are being made to attempt to better establish the cultural associations of the cave. The results of these studies provide some of the first archaeological information for northern Nicaragua. Armstrong-Fumero, Fernando (Smith College) [212] When Does it Stop Being Heritage?: Pre-Hispanic Ruins and Contemporary Vernacular Architecture in Yucatán, Mexico The re-use of pre-Hispanic materials to construct house platforms, fences and other everyday structures has a deep history in the lives of rural Yucatec Maya communities, with evidence of selective re-use and transformation of structures spanning from the Pre-Hispanic period to relatively recent times. However, this involves a series of practices that are coded as looting or illegal excavation in the official legal frameworks of the INAH. Reconciling the kind of cultural tradition embodied by the re-use of stone with the demands of contemporary antiquities laws offers a particular series of challenges for thinking about cross-cultural dialogs on heritage. Arnauld, Charlotte (CNRS) [229] New Models to Address an Old Question Classic Maya Highland-Lowland trade relations developed along routes to be defined geographically, but also in socio-political terms. Topography was determinant, but centers operated exchange mechanisms. As it now appears, in both Highlands and Lowlands large settlements were each internally organized according to the altepetl model, an alliance of distinct groups united under one king in one head-city located where their respective territories intersected and where the king lived. Such capitals were gateways locally, some of them were also gateways regionally between Highland and Lowland entities. Such a novel view helps integrate distinct trade modes at several spatial and social scales. [229] Discussant Arnold, Elizabeth [214] see Ambrose, Stanley H.

The general landscape picture is one of long-term paraglacial response superimposed by numerous short-term deviations. Unraveling geogenic causes of observed stratigraphic changes from equally plausible anthropogenic causes remains a challenging task for geoarchaeological research. We focus on the small, upland Allscheid section, close to the bluff-base Modoc Rock Shelter, for a measure of independence in evaluating some of the choices made by the region's Archaic inhabitants.

Until recently dark earths embedding archaeological remains have been considered as homogeneous, dark-colored, poorly-stratified deposits of secondary interest for archaeological understandings. However in past years geoarchaeology has begun to show the enormous potential of studying these soils. In this paper we offer a perspective on the subject based on the comparison of soil micromorphological, textural and geochemical evidence compiled in independent studies of Amazonian and European dark earths. A discussion of questions and observations unpacks the importance of our findings and outlines a framework for the future study of these and other archaeological soils. Arthur, Kathryn (USF St. Petersburg) [17] Reevaluating Gender Roles and Stone Tool Technology in Prehistoric Economies Paleolithic studies continue to describe Stone Age women`s labor as low-skilled, expedient, and homebound including their lithic technologies. This paper reveals a detailed ethnographic study of women and stone tools focusing on the lives and histories of a select group of Konso women, who procure high quality stone from long distances, produce formal tools with skill, and use their tools efficiently and effectively. These Konso women are skilled knappers, who developed their expertise through long-term practice and apprenticeship. Konso stone tool-using women serve as an alternative to the man-the-toolmaker model redefining Western naturalized gendered division of labor in craft production.

In the Mogollon area it is thought to have been communal, while in the Pueblo world it seems to be aggrandizing. Located in the Southern Cibola region, the Chaco era (A.D. 1050-1130) great houses of Cox Ranch Pueblo and Cerro Pomo provide the opportunity to characterize feasting at the border of the Pueblo and Mogollon worlds. Rim arc analysis of plain and painted wares from the great houses and surrounding communities provide inferences about the intra- and inter-site feasting dynamics of Cibola communities. Asch, David (New York State Museum) and Nancy Asch Sidell (Center for American Archeology) [173] Lower Illinois Valley Archeobotany: 1970­1985 By 1970 the Illinois Valley Archeological Program`s flotation system was recovering carbonized plant remains in prodigious quantities. But how was one to use these materials? Between the performance of a prehistoric activity and preservation of an archeobotanical assemblage, so many events of selection, reduction, and disorganization intervene that inferences from excavated remains to prehistoric behavior or environment may seem scarcely feasible. Nevertheless, as sampling, analytical, and interpretative methods advanced, patterns emerged that almost certainly are signals of behavior and environment. Investigation of the economic potential, systematics, and morphology of key species contributed significantly to interpretations of the region`s archeobotanical record. Asch, David [215] see Asch Sidell, Nancy Asch Sidell, Nancy (Center for American Archeology Research Associate) and David Asch (New York State Museum) [215] Early Archaic Archaeobotany of the Koster Site, Illinois Archaeobotanical studies of lower Illinois Valley components span more than 8000 years and record a sequence of plant utilization at first involving minor levels of plant-food harvesting and food storage, followed by major reliance on (managed?) nut masts and (over several millennia) gradually increasing reliance on an annual-plant horticulture. Significant changes in the region's vegetation (anthropogenically induced in part?) occurred during this time. Multiple stratified occupations at the Koster site open a window on

long-term trends at one locality. This paper reports new archaeobotanical analyses from Koster Horizons 11-12, the site's earliest major occupational unit (8700-8100 RCYBP).

My choice of analytical focus is spatial organization, as expressed in architecture, settlement patterns, and landscape. Andrews' findings have profoundly constructive implications for modeling ancient lifeways. Asner, Greg [230] see McCoy, Mark D.

Still ~120,000 individuals remain in possession of Federal Agencies or museums; having been labeled culturally unidentifiable. Many Native American communities view these as ancestors-- naming them grandmothers and grandfathers. The power to determine cultural affiliation and the data required to make such determinations is the central focus of this paper. I argue that if we take repatriation and the intent of NAGPRA seriously, the next 20 years requires focused effort to erase the cultural space existing between naming these individuals culturally unidentifiable and restoring their status as grandparents.

Developing a picture of animal exploitation at Kultepe/Kanesh and KamanKalehoyuk, a major urban center and a small town, respectively, I seek to identify zooarchaeological signatures of socioeconomic inequalities. A large number of cuneiform tablets unearthed at Kultepe/Kanesh offer direct evidence for many aspects of life and hint about food production and consumption during the Middle Bronze Age (2000-1750 BC) in central Anatolia, providing us with a unique opportunity to test the relationships between textual and zooarchaeological evidence. Atkins, Ashley (College of William and Mary), Christopher Shephard (College of William and Mary) and Martin Gallivan (College of William and Mary) [225] Memory and Social Reproduction in the Algonquian Chesapeake Native communities in the Chesapeake have recently invoked memories of places and events of the precontact past in more public ways. We draw connections between these invocations and the circa AD 1300 establishment of several communities with prominent landscape features that served as centers of social construction. During the colonial-era Chesapeake Algonquians continually revisited and reconfigured these places to bury ancestors, sacrifice animals, and inter objects, even after the residential population departed. We conclude by discussing the roles that memory, materiality, and landscape play in precontact social reproduction and the social engagement of contemporary Native communities with the deep past.

Mississippian Morphological Variation in Body Shape and Proportions This study compares body shape variation reconstructed from skeletal remains among and within three broad stylistically distinct Mississippian regions. We hypothesize there is no significant morphological variation among the regions, assuming gene flow accompanied cultural exchange regardless of stylistic regional differences. Results show significant differences between western Caddoan populations and groups from the east, which did not differ from each other. There is significant variation in morphology within the two eastern regions. Comparisons of Mississippians with samples from neighboring Plains Village and Fort Ancient cultural regions, however, indicate relative homogeneity in Mississippian peoples' morphologies, with the exception of the Caddoans.

Between these two regions is the basin of the Ebro River, which flows NE to SW along the southern edge of the Cantabrian-Pyrenean mountain chains and down to the Mediterranean Sea. Its importance as an avenue of communication has long been understood in Spanish prehistory. The goal of this presentation is to compare the Ebro and Mediterranean regions during Greenland Stadial 1--Younger Dryas--focusing on the record of the transition between the Upper Palaeolithic and Epipaleolithic, drawing notably on site distributions, radiocarbon chronology, paleoenvironmental reconstructions and the sequence of archeological evidences for human adaptations in this southerly part of Europe the end of the Pleistocene.

This paper deals with issues between security and open access to scientific information. Many State Historic Preservation Offices, such as the NYSHPO, the PHMC, and IHPA, have made archaeological data and GIS maps of site locations available online. In many cases, access to these databases is limited to archaeology professionals, and the general public can only view a soft version where site locations are not given, and artifacts are not specifically mentioned. These databases are an invaluable tool for the CRM professional, as they limit the need to go physically to an office and pour through past reports, but they also seem to limit the information they provide, often only giving an abstract of prior reports for the area. In addition, while they inform the general public about loosely defined archaeologically sensitive areas,` they do not go further than that and provide no guidance for the avocational archaeologist or history buff that is acting in accordance with the law.

Comparisons with petroglyph motifs in regions to the south and north indicate that Ometepe petroglyphs were more affiliated with a widespread abstract curvilinear tradition found in rock art in lower Central America and probably associated with Chibchan culturals. Indicators of Mesoamerican contact and influence were found, but are a relatively weak presence.

After 1965 there was a hiatus in excavations at the site but, several Indiana University field schools were conducted at the Angel site prior to resumption of annual excavations by Indiana University in 2005. This paper will present the findings of these neglected field schools (1976, 1977, and 1989) and discuss their relevance in light of both Glenn Black`s work and the greater understanding of the Angel site that has developed over the last forty years.

At 9.44 ka the wetland was catastrophically buried. This event was prefaced by a switch to C4 grasses (9.95 ka). Nearly 4 m of sediments accumulated in the arroyo between 9.447.34 ka. Clovis-age pollens and environmental isotopes are compared to a nearby high-resolution speleothem record. The paleoecology and archaeology of the valley is discussed in relation to the BA/YD transition and the development of the N.A. Monsoon. Ballenger, Jesse [234] see Zedeno, Maria N. Baltus, Melissa (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) [15] Community in Conflict? Warfare and Violence in Cahokian History Construction of a palisade at Cahokia in the mid-twelfth century signals to many archaeologists the initiation of conflict. However, aside from a handful of fortified sites, some burned structures, and warrior iconography (created at and dispersed from Cahokia), more conclusive evidence for conflict is lacking in the American Bottom.

This contrasts with the larger region within Cahokia`s influence where there is unquestionable evidence for violence. This paper will explore possible sources and directions of conflict with the goal of understanding how violence became reiterated throughout Cahokia`s history, and, in fact, may have been written into the Cahokia`s history from its inception.

With much of the Sierra del Lacandon National Park currently inaccessible due to illegal settlement, an agricultural potential model was created. The model identifies areas with varying potential for maize agriculture. The model is based on data derived from the AIRSAR digital elevation model (DEM). We tested the model against ground-referenced soil and vegetation data collected in the Sierra del Lacondon and Tikal National Parks. Bamforth, Douglas (University of Colorado) [220] What Do We Know About Warfare on the Great Plains? Archaeological data from the Plains unambiguously document a long history of community-level violence in the region. The fact of war, though, opens a wide range of other questions. Who was fighting? How was violence organized? Why did communities get along at some times and attack each other at other times? This paper identifies a series of important aspects of war on the Plains and considers what we do and do not know about them. [256] Discussant Bandy, Matthew (SWCA Environmental Consultants) [222] Titicaca Basin Archaeolinguistics and Farming/Language MicroDispersals David Browman made an early and important contribution to the study of the linguistic history of the Titicaca Basin with his 1992 article "Titicaca Basin archaeolinguistics: Uru, Pukina and Aymara AD 7501450". In this paper, he explored relationships between archaeological cultures and protohistoric language distributions in more depth than had previously been attempted. I revisit this issue from the perspective of the Farming/Language Dispersal Hypothesis. I hope to demonstrate that protohistoric language distributions in the South-Central Andes can be adequately explained by a combination of Farming/Language Micro-Dispersals and sociolinguistic processes associated with the Tiwanaku state. [87] see Railey, Jim A. Banffy, Eszter (Archaeolical Institute Has, Budapest, Hungary) [61] Same People, Different Environment: The Neolithic Transition in the Carpathian Basin The first farmers, originally part of a large Balkanic cultural complex, separated into well distinguishable groups in the northernmost part of their distribution (6th Mill. BC). The group in Transdanubia distributed in hilly woodlands, while east of the Danube, they lived along flat riversides. Soon, profound changes appear in the Western, woodland culture. These changes can partly be explained as adapting to the new, temperate environmental and ecologic conditions. However, the changes also resulted in different cultural habits, as in differences of their group identities. The reasons may help understanding, why various Neolithisation models existed within a rather small region.

Bardolph, Dana (University of California Santa Barbara) [151] Finding Food in Features: A Spatial Analysis of the Lamb Site Regional comparisons of plant subsistence can obscure understandings of food production, consumption, and disposal by lumping contexts together into site assemblages. This paper presents an intrasite analysis of the Lamb site in the Central Illinois River Valley, where little is known about Mississippian-period subsistence. Exploratory data analysis is used to tease stages of the food process apart by using plant refuse to define feature function. As the Lamb site has no visible architecture, such an analysis can ultimately lend a better understanding of site function as well as everyday subsistence practices in the region.

Analysis of these patterns--both spatial and iconographical-provide opportunities to better understand both the role of SECC objects in antiquity and, more generally, how meaning is conveyed,

construed and constrained by individual iconographic objects.

In order to improve understanding of this topic, we employ a novel methodology based on total organic carbon analysis, protein assays and LC-MS to test experimentally prepared, protein-spiked pottery. Further, we evaluate several extraction protocols to determine an optimal approach. In addition to independently replicating previously reported results, our data shed new light on the nature of protein-ceramic interactions and enable us to provide methodological suggestions for future proteomics-based studies.

Maize farming and storage strategies are modeled within the context of behavioral ecology, and granaries are examined as another dimension of subsistence. By the 800s these people had acquired all the hallmarks of "Fremont" culture and occupied small, seasonal household farms on benches and knolls overlooking Range Creek. A dramatic change in farming and storage practices is indicated circa AD1000, when Fremont began storing large quantities of maize in remote cliff granaries, along with some wild crops.

development of gazelle dominance in the Natufian while examining zooarchaeological data from six Epipalaeolithic assemblages from the northern coastal plain, Israel, altogether spanning the period between ca. 20-11.5 ky BP. Natufian ungulate assemblages are more heavily dominated by gazelles than preceding assemblages. These differences are not consistent with climatic fluctuations or climaticallydriven landscape changes to which Natufian populations were responding. Thus, our results accord the cultural filter hypothesis. Barr, W. Andrew (University of Texas at Austin) and Denné N.

The rodent sample exhibits gastric etching and extensive fragmentation; this evidence is consistent with the activity of a small mammalian carnivore. The rodent fauna is dominated by Meriones cf. maghrebianus, a taxon indicative of a xeric habitat, but not true desert. The presence of Dipodillus campestris reinforces the xeric habitat interpretation. The murine Mus spretus is also present, but is relatively uninformative in regards to habitat. This taxonomic composition suggests a Mediterranean biome comparable to that of the present-day site. Barrett, Jason W.

Barton, Loukas (National Park Service) [197] Disaster and density-dependent habitat selection in southwest Alaska Prehistoric sites in southwest Alaska are strongly clustered around spatially delimited, resource-rich areas characterized by high taxonomic diversity today. Yet severe ecological turnover driven by volcanoes, tsunamis, and tectonic uplift or subsidence characterize the environmental history of the region. These punctuated disasters frequently force local populations of people, plants and animals into prolonged exile. Because re-colonization episodes are commonplace, the region is an ideal setting to evaluate and refine the logic and assumptions of density-dependent habitat selection and the ideal free distribution. This is an effort to examine the patterns of resource intensification in a spatially-structured but temporally volatile environment.

Dissemination of archaeological data to the public has been an important part of cultural resources management archaeology. The inexpensive standby for a public dissemination document has been the brochure or the booklet. Newer technologies that continue to become available allow for more sophisticated and elaborate public dissemination documents to be produced for substantially less money. The use of these tools is limited more by our imagination and our ability to communicate with the general public than the cost outlay. Booklets, pamphlets, brochures, web pages, video productions, exhibits, signs, posters, lectures, etc. are all means of providing the public with information concerning archaeological resources. Each of these mitigative elements, or a combination of several, may be the most appropriate mitigation measure on a specific project. It is important to identify whether the archaeological story can be appropriately disseminated with an "off the rack" solution, or whether a "tailor-made" approach is more appropriate. This paper provides examples of varying uses of media and products that have been successfully employed in an effort to appeal to the varying levels of knowledge and interest represented by the potential target audience. The work is considered within the context that of how the dissemination document can meet the needs of the project, be produced at a reasonable cost, as well as provide information and insights into the past that resonate with the public.

Twenty-four specimens from six Sus scrofa forelimbs were cut using three saws and a knife. Specimens were weighed, photographed, and tool marks were analyzed before and after burning. They were burned in an outdoor fire (277- 770°C) or in a kiln at 600, 800, or 1000°C. Preservation of saw marks was scored on a scale of 1 to 3 (3 being least preserved) using photographic comparison. As hypothesized, higher temperature correlated to degradation. However, retention of saw marks was adequate for some analysis up to 1000°C. Bauder, Jennifer [83] see Wilson, Jeremy J. Bauer, Andrew (University of Chicago) [11] An Archaeology of 'Nature': South Indian Landscape History and the Construction of the Natural A series of environmental features (e.g., rock pools, weathering pits, and soil distributions) were produced during the South Indian Iron Age as a means of appropriating space for politically instrumental ritual activities and privileged access to agro-pastoral production. Yet, despite a long history of human-environment interaction, 19th and 20th century colonial naturalists would later classify many of these same objects as characteristic elements of an a-priori people-less "Nature." What were politicized objects to Iron Age inhabitants became equally political (sensu Latour`s "political epistemology") in a different context when natural science paradigms began categorizing them as natural elements of tropical landscapes.

Excavations at Madera Quemada pueblo were sponsored by the Environmental Division of Fort Bliss and provided a rare opportunity to investigate a Jornada Mogollon pueblo in southcentral New Mexico. The pueblo consisted of a single roomblock of 13 rooms. Several rooms were burned, and deposits of burned roofing debris and support beams were present on floors. Floor and subfloor features were in an outstanding state of preservation and contained intact floor assemblages. The excavations provided important information on architecture, room function, social organization, and ritual abandonment of the pueblo. Beaubien, Harriet (Smithsonian / Museum Conservation Institute) [77] Burial Offerings Made of Painted Perishable Materials at Waka' Ornate objects once made of painted wood, gourd and other organic materials were among the special offerings recently found in several elite tombs at El Perú-Waka'. What has challenged our understanding and appreciation of these types of artifacts is their degraded state when found ­ typically as dense concentrations of paint flakes resulting from complete degradation of the organic substrates. At Waka', field conservation techniques used to recover some of the deposits and technical study of paint flakes from a range of objects are yielding important new data about how they were produced and what kind of offerings they might have been. Beaver, Joseph (University of Minnesota Morris) [73] Hunter-Gatherer Ethnology and the Tyranny of Linear Analysis (with Apologies to H.M.

Such analyses almost invariably involve regression or correlation. Even with multiple regression and partial correlation analyses, there is an implicit assumption that causal variables act independently of one another--that their contributions to outcome variables can be combined linearly. Much recent research in and outside of archaeology suggests that many aspects of human organization and adaptation behave non-linearly. This paper applies fuzzy-set theory to a large ethnographic data set compiled by Lawrence Keeley, demonstrating an alternative to linear analyses. Bech, Julio Amador [22] see Amador, Julio A.

Roughly 100 miles separate the Orendorf site, a Mississippian town, from the American Bottom, and evidence of Cahokian influence is seen in assemblages from more distant Mississippian sites. This paper compares the lithic assemblage from settlement "D" at the Orendorf site with those of American Bottom Mississippian sites, including Cahokia. We address raw material use, a lack of centrally organized and rigid production standards, and the relative obscurity of interregional exchange in the settlement "D" assemblage.

Archaeologists often rely on culture history and its labels of identity while Native Americans often rely on oral traditions and its identity labels. A case study provides a context for considering the genealogy of knowledge inherent in such a claim and the imbalance of power that may lead to epistemic injustice. [180] see Gibb, James G.

Like in similar Patagonian environments, the first recorded occupation occurs at the beginning of the Holocene. The basin seems to have been only occasionally used until 5.5 ky cal BP, when the frequency of radiocarbon dates increases, coincident with the stabilization of the local environmental conditions. The summed probability distribution of the calibrated radiocarbon dates corresponding to Late Holocene ages differs from those recorded at neighboring areas, thus suggesting a rather decoupled pattern of occupation at the mesoscale, whose likely meaning will be discussed during the presentation.

A culmination of 12 years of excavations, demonstrates that Mound 34 is an exemplar of the distinct characteristics of the Moorehead Phase.

Ceramic seriation and a mean ceramic date of c. 1797 suggest an occupation earlier than that indicated by historical documents (c. 1806-1822). We use data from nearby contemporary sites ­ including several occupied by enslaved African-American laborers ­ to consider whether this discrepancy reflects a flaw in

archival records or whether the seemingly early assemblage date, in this and somewhat comparable cases, reflects strategies in ceramic consumption frequent among socio-economically middling families.

Two large centers, El Cafetal and El Paraíso, located 1.5 km apart, formed nodes in Copan`s network of interaction, and together they provide insight into Copan`s regional administrative strategies. In this paper, we explore these strategies to suggest that, while El Paraíso was established by Copan to exert control in the region, and El Cafetal was a local, autochthonous center, patterns seen in rural settlements suggest a complex and contested web of affiliations in the valley and beyond.

Ancestral Pueblo populations in the Central Mesa Verde (CMV) region and the Northern Rio Grande (NRG) developed diverse farming techniques to sustain their communities in the face of everchanging natural environmental and demographic circumstances. Research undertaken as part of the Village Ecodynamics Project-II is examining the similarities and differences between the agricultural systems upon which the pre-Columbian CMV and NRG Pueblo populations relied.

'Ubeidiya, Israel (1.6-1.2 Ma) is one of the earliest site to attest to this dispersal. The cervid guild at the site bears marks of utilization by hominins for meat consumption and may be a used as a proxy for landscape use by Homo. We describe the range of environments utilized by the cervid guild using paleodietary (mesowear) and paleolocomotion (3D geomorphometrics). Results suggest a range of mosaic woodland and open environs and emphasize the role of closed habits in early hominin behavior in contrast in those in East Africa.

Key attributes including overshot flakes, fluted preform, and ochre staining aid in identifying a Clovis affiliation for the cache contents.

Two points, at its extremes, capture light cast by the solstice sun. A personified disk gazes at the setting sun, which casts light on its face. Another line, 2,200 BC, shows helical rise of Andean water constellations over one rock, set on a ridge, and the solstice sunrise over another. Deduced alignments for nearby sites were found.

An applied statistical approach including the use of correspondence analysis has been used on baseline data and pollen concentration values, providing a quantified look at the apparent trends within the pollen record.

from multiple contexts of a single site. In the past, the middens at Back Creek Village (AD 1200-1600), on St. Catherines Island, Georgia, were attributed to refuse that accumulated outside structures occupied by sedentary households. However, intra- and inter-midden variation must be evaluated to determine if these middens represent similar modes of accumulation. This study uses seasonal presence of fishes in the estuary and seasonal growth of Mercenaria spp. to explore seasonal patterns of midden deposition. This will facilitate an assessment of site function and seasonal occupation.

Agents make decisions about farming and herding strategies based upon landscape characteristics (drawn from the GIS) and household subsistence needs. In turn, agent agricultural practices contribute to simulated landscape dynamics. This allows us to carry out 'experiments', as multiple model runs with variable initial conditions, to explore the impact of household subsistence decisions on Holocene landscape evolution in the Penaguila Valley of eastern Spain.

[238] First Organizer; [238] First Chair Bernardini, Wesley (University of Redlands) [100] Ceramic Connections: Documenting Ties between the Hopi Mesas and the Verde Region in the 14th Century A.D. This analysis investigated contacts and movement between sites in the Perry Mesa/Verde regions and sites on the Hopi Mesas through chemical sourcing of Jeddito Yellow Ware pottery. Results indicate that all of the analyzed Perry Mesa/Verde sites shared a similar set of exchange ties with Hopi villages. These ties were dominated by Second Mesa villages, with secondary ties to Antelope Mesa. The relatively homogeneous pattern of non-local pottery acquisition across the area suggests some degree of coordinated interaction with external groups. While similar exchange patterns across Perry Mesa might seem to support the existence of the hypothesized "Perry Mesa confederacy", the fact that neighboring villages in the supposedly antagonistic Verde region share the same exchange patterns suggest that a broader regional phenomenon is at work. Bernardo, Danilo [47] see Strauss, André Bernbeck, Reinhard (Freie Universitaet Berlin) [114] Materiality as Intrusive Temporal Surplus Archaeology is fundamentally concerned with human actions that produce an effect lasting beyond themselves, in Aristotelian terms, with poiesis. Based on our own, consumer based predilection for a world of full of things, we often assume that the making and enduring of things was desirable as well in the past. Based on an example from Neolithic Iran, I claim that we have to consider the possibility of past

societies that were opposed to what I call the temporal surplus of objects. Temporal surplus was seen as restrictive for a society that may have been based on spontaneity and immaterial production. Berrey, Charles (University of Pittsburgh) [73] Domestic Activities and Social Relations: Comparing Household Artifact Assemblages using Multidimensional Scaling Multidimensional scaling (MDS) is an effective analytical tool in archaeology. One of its particularly useful features is the ability to examine how values for different variables might generally increase or decrease across an MDS configuration. Identifying these trends` and the orientations in which they are aligned provides valuable insight into the relationship between variables, and a systematic way to do so would allow for greater utility of MDS in comparative studies. One such method is presented here, and is used to compare household artifact assemblages so as to explore the nature of activities and social relations within different prehistoric communities.

Recent excavations, however, are beginning to change what researchers know about those who administered and lived under imperial Inka rule. The research presented here investigates intra/inter-phenotypic variability of several Inka sites in Peru. These findings are interpreted in context of the Inka`s socio-political organization as an empire and will add to a growing body of literature surrounding the bioarchaeology of pre-colonial imperial societies.

The data set is comprised of thin sections made from a soil column collected from the Chiripa mound and adobes collected at the site, as well as parallel bulk samples. This enables the paper to use more than one line of geoarchaeological data during its investigation of Chiripa. Bettinger, Robert (University of California-Davis) [197] Technological Investment and Intensification The simplified model of technological investment developed by Bettinger, Winterhalder, and McElreath anticipates diverse trajectories of intensification.

Less common is the introduction of a novel design that renders existing alternatives obsolete or fills a niche between them. As in Sewall W right`s shifting balance theory, the first trajectory is that of simple peak climbing in response to economic demand, the second that of peak shifting governed by less predictable forces including the advent of novel technologies and their match with existing sociopolitical structures.

Beyond the Maritime Peninsula, shark teeth have been recovered from Adena contexts ranging from Chesapeake Bay to the Ohio River. In this paper, we explore how sharks were signified in mortuary contexts in the Maritime Peninsula, and what these human-animal relationships reveal about Late Archaic and Early Woodland Period societies. We address how local human-animal relationships were expressed in regional ritual complexes, and more importantly, how these local relationships became entangled in greater Northeastern funerary practices.

This paper focuses on the earliest proposed examples, examining the characteristics and assumptions used to define them as popol nas and their possible role in the evolution of Classic Maya society. Examples from Ek Balam, Kiuic and Labna are discussed in detail in order to consider the reality of popol nas, their function in the development of social stratification in the northern Maya lowlands and how they may also reflect changes in social organization during the

Late Classic. Bey, George [78] see Galaty, Michael L. Beyries, Sylvie (CNRS) [17] Domestic Activities, Craft and Environment Ethnographic research has demonstrated how in many traditional communities (such as Siberian communities), craft production and domestic activities are gender specialized. The organization of craft production within these communities is both economically and socially motivated. However, when these communities are under extreme environmental and social pressures (climate, economy and crisis), the rules of gendered division labor become more flexible. These ethnographic studies enable us to be more flexible for archaeological interpretations.

By reflecting about the social representations of the ruins and the role of these representations to the community`s attitudes towards the site, I explore the underlying logic of looting ­ a common practice - and the subsequent organization of "small domestic collections". My purpose is to understand the relationship between small scale communities and the patrimony as well as to contribute to the political policy concerned to heritage preservation in Amazon.

Only a small number of Portuguese archaeological sites are dated to Dryas III (12,800-11,600 cal BP). In contrast, many sites are dated prior to or after the event. Because highly flexible cultural, economic and technological systems characterize the regional Upper Paleolithic, it seems humans were able to adapt to increased aridity, lowered temperatures, and important changes in vegetation. Here we will focus on: the lack of evidence for human occupation (population decline or formation processes affecting the archaeological record?); climatic and geological processes resulting in the erosion and loss of sites; abandonment and relocation of humans as resource availability shifted.

Northern Iroquoian societies underwent a macro-regional process of coalescence during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries A.D. Settlement data indicate that large, well-planned and heavily fortified communities formed out of previously distinct local groups. One such community inhabited the Mantle site, an early sixteenth century ancestral Wendat (Huron) village in southern Ontario. Recent archaeometric analysis of ceramic material combined with analyses of lithic and settlement pattern data indicate that the Mantle community was also involved in interactions that crossed linguistic, social and political boundaries. This paper demonstrates the efficacy of multi-scalar analytical and theoretical frameworks in elucidating patterns of interaction. Bird, Douglas [118] see Zeanah, David W. Bird, M.

Radiocarbon assays, a newly defined protohistoric ware (D`Friant) and European trade goods allow us to separate some features into temporal categories and provide information about the spatial distributions of the site's components.

Birnbaum, Michelle (University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee) [102] More Than Just a Box of Rocks: Mineralogical and Use Analysis of Fire-Cracked Rock from the Late Prehistoric/Proto-Historic New Lenox Site, New Lenox, Illinois For those working on prehistoric sites in North America, fire cracked rock (FCR) is a ubiquitous artifact. In some cases FCR is the only cultural indicator of human activity, but in the Midwest rarely is FCR collected and analyzed. Due its ubiquity and significant volume this material class is often discarded with only cursory documentation. Mineralogical and use analysis of FCR from the New Lenox Site provides interesting insights into raw material use, reuse and collection strategies as part of a larger pattern of resource exploitation. Bishop, Ronald (Smithsonian Institution) [51] Facing Anna Shepard Anna O. Shepard may be best known by her groundbreaking textbook and her quest for objectivity in ceramic analysis. She is variously referred to as brilliant, scathingly harsh, dedicated, mean, strange, and loving. Undeniably, she fought her way through blatant bias, achieving archaeological fame in her pioneering work as a laboratory specialist. In the end, her unwavering dedication to the role of objective analysis left her despondent, outside of archaeology`s thirst for abstraction through an emerging contagion of ceramic taxonomy. This paper examines the life and times of this diminutive fighter who attempted to further archaeology as a scientific pursuit.

Such "top-down" perspectives not only homogenize archaeological representations but affect the social and political trajectory of indigenous groups such as the Maya. This paper examines the relationship between archaeological research, the production of knowledge, and the creation and recreation of both ancient and modern Maya identities.

Many of these explanations are environmentally oriented, but are limited by the data available at the time they were developed. In this poster, GIS is used to document the environments surrounding effigy mound sites near Lake Koshkonong, and to compare those locations to other Late Woodland sites in the same region. The analysis will also attempt to take into account change through time in site location. The final goal is to highlight the complexity of Late Woodland period in settlement Southeastern Wisconsin.

The implications of each of these possible ages are important, and how to place the art in proper chronological context is a fundamental puzzle in this site that requires technological resolution.

Combat that resulted when they met involved establishment of temporary positions, strategic movements, and the pitched battles of Mud Springs and Rush Creek.

Remote sensing data are particularly useful in providing spatial context for resources and infrastructure supporting past populations. Accordingly, remote sensing data can be a powerful tool for increasing efficiency of archaeological investigations when systematically integrated into investigation protocols. Projects successfully applying remote sensing data have common characteristics including partnerships between archaeologists, remote sensing specialists, and those with GIS expertise. We discuss successful examples of remote sensing data applied to archaeological efforts in diverse environments. Blomster, Jeffrey (George Washington University) [260] The Naked and the Clothed: Embodiment, Gender and Social Identity in Formative Oaxaca and Olman I explore the roles of costume and embodiment in expressing gender and social identity primarily in Formative Oaxaca, Mexico. Examining figurines reveals distinct patterns in how the body is conceived, elaborated and ornamented. Early in the Formative, costumes rarely cover the bodies on these figurines, while headdresses and iconography located on the head occur more frequently; changes in materialization of bodies and their ornamentation during the Formative reflect ongoing negotiations of social identity. Finally, I consider methodological issues in comparing gender and social identity evinced on clay figurines with that expressed in monumental art in Olman.

In 2009 I analyzed the lithic artifacts from the fluted point horizon. Goals of analysis were to determine the technological choices made by the site`s earliest occupants and how these related to toolstone provisioning and settlement organization. In this paper I present details on the stratigraphic context, lithic technology and raw material sources of the Higgins artifacts. The earliest occupants of the Higgins site employed a combination of expedient and formal technologies that were tied to variable toolstone quality and availability. Boatwright, Mark (BLM) and Andreas Charest (BLM) [211] Prehistoric Paiute Use of Yucca in Southern Nevada Ethnographic data suggest that annual plants such as Indian Rice grass formed a substantial part of the Paiute diet in the Great Basin. Optimal forager theory predicts that resources from more reliable perennial plants such as Yucca species would have been more highly ranked by the prehistoric Southern Paiute bands that lived in the Mojave Desert. Ethnobotanical and ceramic residue analyses associated with rock ring features confirm that the prehistoric Southern Paiute sought out locally occurring perennial Yucca species in favor of patchy and unreliable annual plant resources over an

identifiable period of time.

They provide information on vegetation type (13C/12C), trophic web structure (13C/12C, 15N/14N), precipitation and temperature (18O/16O). Bones from various species excavated in caves from the Swabian Jura exhibit excellent preservation. The isotopic data from the Swabian Jura Aurignacian fauna will be compared to those of older and younger periods in the same region, and to those of other regions during the same period. This will help us determining whether the Swabian Jura presented unusual environmental conditions during the Aurignacian period related to exceptional cultural development. Bocinsky, R.

However, the amount of human energy required to extract the marrow has previously not been quantified. This study measures both the amount energy (calories) expended during cold marrow` extraction and the impact forces (Newtons) required to break each bone element. Our results demonstrate that cold marrow extraction is energetically twice as

One such boundary involved a no-man`s land that separated Eastman and Lewis phase effigy mound peoples.

Throughout the coastal regions of southern California, abandonment of coastal estuarine sites like CAORA-64 at the end of the Early Holocene has been attributed hypothetically to the silting of estuaries and declining availability of estuarine resources.

[88] Exploring the Theoretical Basis of Forensic Archaeology Forensic Archaeology has recently gained prominence as an important form of applied archaeology. However, development of a theoretical basis for forensic archaeology has been limited largely to the exploration of taphonomic processes. In this paper, we examine the relationship between archaeological theory and forensics. Specifically, we discuss both agency theory (in terms of the actions of individual and collective agents) and behavioral archaeology (the behavioral chain concept) as useful theoretical models for more broadly explaining and interpreting the roles of perpetrators, victims, investigators, and environmental factors in the creation of a forensic scene.

This paper describes fire pits encountered in excavations, their location, architectural context and associated artifacts. Were these burning events public ritual events, or private actions of intentional destruction by the occupants? In honor of E. Wyllys Andrews V, little speculation is offered about symbolic intentions and rather more is made of archaeological evidence for burning at sites such as Seibal and Copan. Symbolic speculation is strictly limited in favor of focus on accurate placement of recovered data in a defensible temporal and geographic framework.

This paper considers the general category of huaca in light of recent theoretical discussions on materiality, animacy, and personhood. Whether huacas were understood as persons, how this may have been expressed, how we approach such questions archaeologically, and what new insights into native Andean ontologies may obtain are outlined in the paper.

A data recovery excavation on Site 33Wa797, a multi-component site in southwest Ohio, yielded valuable information on Middle Woodland exploited resources. Although no features were encountered, ceramic residue analysis revealed information on exploited EAC resources. One notable result from the analysis was the identification of angular starch typical of starches produced by Zea mays. It should not be assumed that due to the recovery of corn on a Middle Woodland site that corn was heavily exploited during this period. However, this discovery may document the early, slow progression of corn`s movement from south to north during the Middle Woodland period. [179] First Chair

Bremer, J (Santa Fe National Forest) [152] The Big Picture: Thirteenth Century Gallina Archaeology in Northern New Mexico Along the Continental Divide Recent archaeological investigations in northern New Mexico in the Llaves Valley and in the southern San Juan Basin suggest differences with regard to Gallina cultural development between the two areas. Llaves Valley populations appear to perpetuate a conservative lifestyle for 200 years with little or no contact with local populations while a short distance away to the west and south, populations with similar material culture, architecture and settlement patterns show evidence of interaction with adjacent populations in the Basin. This paper summarizes the current status of Gallina archaeology and explores potential explanations for the differences between the two areas. Bremer, J. Michael [19] see Kulisheck, Jeremy R.

Insights into past climate and environment in the region are gleaned from lake and marine sediment cores, speleothems, tree rings, and corals. Paleolimnological studies in the Maya region began in the 1950s. New field and laboratory techniques enable collection of very long cores and high-resolution analysis of proxy variables for climate and environment. We summarize results of paleolimnological studies in the Maya Lowlands, covering the last ~85,000 years, and focus on environmental changes during the Maya Period (~30001000 BP).

Ghairadin Khozhaniyazov (Institute of History, Archaeology, and Ethnography, Karakalpak Branch, Uzbek Academy of Sciences, Nukus) [32] Local and Global Patterns of Socio-Political Integration in Khorezm, Uzbekistan Monumental sites appeared in Khorezm by the sixth century BCE, but strong evidence for domestic habitation remains conspicuously absent from the archaeological record for nearly a millennia. When habitation structures appear more prominently in the fourth century CE, the pattern is one of small, heavily fortified homesteads dispersed along irrigation canals with little evidence for concentrations around monumental sites. This pattern raises significant questions about the relationship between local and global spheres of interaction within the Khorezmian polity, in particular questions about the socio-political integration of domestic communities and their relationship to monumental site activities. Recent excavations at the site of Kara-Tepe in Khorezm suggest two different patterns of change in Khorezm: a possible continuity in the local-level social order that occurred alongside dramatic and rapid changes in the monumental complexes. This paper presents new research from Kara-Tepe that reveals how local inhabitants were integrated within this larger system of shared social order. Brooks, Alison [151] see Henry, Amanda G.

FT-IR analysis was conducted in an attempt to determine if differences in resource utilization existed between the two sub-cultures. Analysis conducted in this study was performed using a Perkin Elmer 1720X FT-IR Spectrometer. Results from laboratory testing support subcultural variation in the types of food and non-food substances that the ceramic vessels held. Brosnan, Patrick G.

The site, located east of Sandy Creek and 3.5 miles east of the Illinois River, produced seven C-14 dates with intercept dates ranging from AD 770-1020. Archeobotanical remains produced evidence of domesticated plants including goosefoot, knotweed, maygrass, pigweed, little barley, and squash. Ceramic types from the site do not conform to known types in the region, but rather they share attributes with several types including Egan Zoned, Jersey Bluff, and Bauer Branch. Ceramic diversity at 11ST544 suggests the site occupied a frontier or crossroads setting among several cultural groups during the later stages of the Late Woodland period. Brown, Claire [185] see Kuijt, Ian Brown, Clifford (Florida Atlantic University), April Watson (Florida Atlantic University) and Ashley Gravlin-Beman (Florida Atlantic University) [178] Wealth and Society at Mayapán Late Postclassic lowland culture at Mayapán used to be described as "decadent." Decadence is, however, a subjective quality that has been widely rejected as an explanation. Rathje subsequently

suggested that the unattractive qualities of the culture derived from a highly efficient mercantile economic system that created a more egalitarian distribution of goods in society. We argue that widespread poverty caused Mayapán`s poor material culture. The distribution of wealth in Maya society indicates that Mayapán society was less egalitarian than Classic Maya society. Mayapán experienced a greater concentration of wealth in a small elite, while the previously robust middle class declined. Brown, Clifford T. [178] see Witschey, Walter R. T.

Pairing the two techniques allows us to take advantage of the in situ and non-destructive nature of pXRF, while utilizing the higher resolution and broader spectrum of elements offered by LA-ICP-MS when necessary.

Settlement location is closely related to proximity to suitable soils, adequate moisture for maize agriculture and sufficient length of growing season. The variable topography resulting from the volcanic history of the Uinkaret Plateau and proximity to raw materials for pottery manufacture (olivine) resulted in some of the highest site densities yet known from upland areas of the Arizona Strip.

Earlier analysis had shown very different distributions of Mill Creek and Dover cherts in the Kincaid area. While Mill Creek appeared to be broadly available in the region the distribution of Dover chert was much more restricted, one that suggested that it was distributed through elite-mediated exchanges. Previously, the only Kincaid samples were from the 1930`s excavations and of uncertain reliability. Here, the issue in the Black Bottom is revisited using data from recent excavations at the Kincaid site. Buvit, Ian and Karisa Terry (Central Washington University) [177] The Twilight of Paleolithic Siberia: Human-Environmental Interactions at the End of the Ice Age Few sites in Siberia are assigned to the Younger Dryas (locally the Nor`ilsk Stade), but occupation persisted despite the re-advance of steppe biota beginning 11,400 BP. Sites are primarily associated with low-energy alluvial landforms where preservation is excellent. Fish bones and other direct evidence of aquatic resource exploitation appeared, while terrestrial animals still were hunted. Technologically there was continuation of microblades, bifaces, and burins, but also harpoons, fishhooks, composite tools, and even pottery in some areas. The Nor`ilsk in Siberia was a watershed between Upper Paleolithic lifeways of the late Pleistocene and more settled Mesolithic traditions of the early Holocene.

As such, greater anatomical knowledge of prey

carcasses probably offered a selective advantage at both intra- and inter-species levels of competition. This study presents experimental data assessing how gained experience affects nutrient acquisition under constraint and how varied butcher experience may be manifest in the zooarchaeological record. These data are discussed in the context of understanding change in hominin carcass processing behaviors through time. Byers, A. Martin (McGill University) [176] The Ohio Hopewell as a System of Cult Sodality Heterarchies Treating the major Ohio Hopewell earthworks as peer-polity alliances is becoming widely accepted. I also treat them as manifesting alliances ­ not polities but mutually autonomous cult sodalities constituting incrementally organized first-order, second-order, and third-order alliances of mutualistic heterarchies that actively pursued the maintenance of cosmic balance through sacred ball games. These games re-enacted the world creation events as represented in historic Native North American myths. The great earthwork locales served as critical monumental symbolic pragmatic devices by which these games were constituted as postmortem sacrificial rituals by which sacred powers immanent in the deceased were recycled back to the world that fed and supported them in life. Byers, David (Missouri State University) and Joan Coltrain (University of Utah) [27] Paleo- and Neo-Aleut Stable Isotope Chemistry We explore two questions important to understanding Aleut prehistory. First, if as Hrdlicka`s craniometric data suggest, the Paleoand Neo-Aleut were distinct groups, are differences reflected in their bone chemistry. Second, did subsistence vary between them and how did food preferences change through time. Our dataset includes isotope data from 80 human skeletons and two zooarchaeological assemblages. Our results suggest that Neo-Aleut pursued higher tropic level marine foods than Paleo-Aleut and that through time Paleo-Aleut diets shifted from offshore to nearshore resources. Finally, the trends in isotope chemistry appear closely linked to the spatial distribution of the human remains.

In this study, tower sites were identified from a review of the ARMS database in Santa Fe, a subsequent review of the original site records, and selected site visits.

The site`s proximity to several distinctive raw material sources, combined with a material culture inventory that spans from Clovis to the Late Woodland period, makes the Breinigsville complex particularly amenable to time-transgressive cultural and technological studies.

[60] From Lithic Distribution to Distribution Network Since the 1950`s, archaeologists have been finding pyroclastic stone artifacts on the shores of the Ottawa and Saint Lawrence rivers. With the discovery of site BiFw-20 (4000-4500 BP), many quickly concluded that we were dealing with a modest Late Archaic distribution network. By better understanding the space, time, lithic sources, fall-off curves and the "chaine opératoire", this study points towards a somewhat more nuanced and complex story of the region. It poses some fundamental questions about archeological methodology involved in bridging the gap between lithic distributions and distribution networks. Cail, Hannah (University of Montana), Anna M. Prentiss (University of Montana), and Michael P. Richards (University of British Columbia) [39] Cultural Implications of Dog Remains at the Bridge River site: Taphonomic and Isotopic Analyses Dogs represent a unique facet of the faunal assemblage at the Bridge River site, a prehistoric village in southern British Columbia. The skeletal remains of at least two dogs recovered from cache pits in Housepit 24 exhibit signs of trauma including perimortem fractures, cut marks, and periostitis. This case is different than the canid assemblage of Keatley Creek, where osteological analysis concludes many of the dogs died of natural causes. The pathologic and taphonomic evidence suggests that the Bridge River canid assemblage results from a single event perhaps associated with a symbolic display of status as associated with feasting. Callaghan, Michael (University of Texas at Arlington) [17] Credit Where Credit's Due: Toward Engendering Preclassic Maya Ceramic Production Ethnoarchaeological and archaeological studies of pottery production in Mesoamerica have demonstrated a pattern of household production where labor is shared between genders or was gendered female. Despite these findings, production and use of ceramics associated with important Maya archaeological contexts is still commonly gendered male. This paper explores the gap between ethnoarchaeological data and archaeological interpretation, endeavoring to address a tacit androcentrism in the interpretation of archaeological contexts. A study of ceramics from Preclassic period caches from the Holmul Region, Guatemala is used to explore the potential role and significance of women in ancient Maya pottery production, exchange, and consumption.

Here we present a broad survey of zooarchaeological data from over 30 Early and Middle Saxon sites in eastern England. These data suggest a shift from a pattern of relative self-sufficiency to one based on specialized production of commodities such as wool. We examine the relationship of this change in animal economies to the social and political transformations that took place in the Middle Saxon period including state formation, urbanism, and the intensification of trade. Campbell, David [241] Contemporary Yucatec, Kekchi and Mopan Maya Home Gardens: What Do They Reveal about Carrying Capacity of La Selva Maya? Maya home gardens have long been recognized as repositories of

native species and the ethnobotanical traditions that pertain to them. We examined the phytosociology, alpha diversity and beta diversity of Yucatec, Kekchi and Mopan Maya domestic forest gardens in western and southern Belize. We examined 37,700 flowering plants in 30 Maya gardens, identifying 515 native species. These gardens are richer in species of flowering plants than the subtropical forests that surrounded them. Indeed, they may be the most species-rich domestic gardens on Earth. What do these statistics reveal about the carrying capacity of the Maya Forest before the "collapse"?

The spatial patterning and number of canoes denotes long-term ritualistic use, as the lake`s size and environment disqualify traditional canoe use. Several canoes show a previously undocumented construction method, suggesting specialization and a newly discovered tradition. The canoes' design and ritualistic use designates the site as highly significant. Recreational divers conducted previous research without documentation.

Its position in the Late Shang capital of Anyang, adjacent to the Miaopu bronze foundry and predominance of cattle bone raise interesting questions. The nature of the assemblage suggests some sort of relationship to the palace-temple area, yet the scale and nature of production suggests wider distribution. This preliminary study will focus on the wider significance of the site, the spatial and temporal distribution of production debris, and the reconstruction of some of the production sequences.

Environmental changes may cause unpredictable biological responses, including the deposition of multiple shell growth breaks. Currently, stable isotope geochemistry is the most effective method for determining seasonality of oysters in the southeast. However morphological indicators have not been consistently correlated with isotopic profiles. This research combines stable oxygen isotope geochemistry with visual analytical techniques that enhance growth structures to establish a simple, low cost method for determining season of capture of oysters in the southeast.

Alternatively, we employ an interractionist approach to model integrative strategies in the western Honduras`s El Paraíso Valley. During the Classic period (AD 250-900) there developed in this valley a complex web of interactions among El Paraíso residents, Maya elites at Copan, and non-Maya groups. Examining El Paraíso and El Cafetal as nodes of multiple interactive networks, we analyze how distinct groups and their leaders sought to structure and control these networks through distinct practices of materialization aimed at community, place-making, and political integration.

By completing a range of molecular analyses on modern and archaeological fish specimens, we contribute to two related issues regarding the application of stable isotope analysis to archaeological fish remains. The first is the potential carbon and nitrogen isotopic values of prehistoric fish (and how these impact human diet), and the second is the lake-fish ecological relationship.

Faunal analysis also shows that secondarily-ranked food resources such as deer and other medium to large terrestrial mammals declined in abundance and taxonomic diversity. Element abundance shifts from equal representations of all parts to more selective (i.e. transportable) leg portions. These trends suggest over-exploitation of secondary food resources correlated with the emergence of socioeconomic inequality late in the history of the village.

Here, we consider the evidence regarding Aztatlán interaction and integration within the adjacent region extending between the Río Mocorito and the Sonoran border; an area encompassing both the Huatabampo and Serrana (Rio Sonora) archaeological traditions. Evidence for interaction vís-a-vís exchange is ubiquitous. While socio-ideological integration may be reflected by both the diffusion of urn burials and the incorporation of Aztatlán materials as funerary offerings, there is, as yet, no evidence that any communities were politically integrated with their Aztatlán neighbors.

Chipped stone artifacts found on Spanish Colonial period and later sites have previously been attributed to mixing of prehistoric materials from underlying or nearby sites with the historic artifacts, or to historic Indian manufacture and use. A similar situation occurs in Colorado. Using archaeological and ethnohistorical data, the argument is made that the modified tools, both lithics and bottle glass, found on historic sites in the Purgatoire and Arkansas Valley region were manufactured by Hispanic New Mexicans and their Colorado descendants.

Castaneda, Quetzil (OSEA) [212] Constructing the Past, Making History: Notes on the Lived Historical Value of Archaeology and the Significance of Autoethnographic Documentation of Archaeological Projects This paper discusses how archaeological research projects have an experiential meaning and historical value for the persons and communities involved in archaeology. In other words, archaeology makes history in the present in and through the relationships it creates with communities. Recognition of this fact creates the scientific imperative that archaeologists figure out ways to start conducting ongoing ethnographic documentation of the social contexts of their research projects. This paper presents concrete ways that archaeologists might actualize such autoethnography or "self"-ethnographic and historical documentation. Castanzo, Ronald (University of Baltimore) [156] Pottery Production in Formative Period Valley of Puebla: Support for the Intermittent Crafting Model Several Formative Period pottery production facilities were excavated in 2007 near the town of San Felipe Tenextepec in the Valley of Puebla. Facility morphology and attributes of the ceramic assemblage suggest part-time household-level economic activity for the purposes of exchange. Since the local population was well below carrying capacity during this time, these households did not engage in the manufacturing and exchange of ceramics out of any need to augment their subsistence regime. For this reason, Hirth`s intermittent crafting model of domestic craft production provides a strong explanatory framework within which to consider early local pottery making.

While social exchanges and ritual practices seem to be a big part of these interactions, violence and coercion were most likely absent. The time period is critical, because it was during this period that he Moche collapsed, that the Transitional phenomenon took shape, and that the Lambayeque eventually took control. These interactions, and their physical manifestations left behind a trail of information that can illustrate the ways these societies interacted, and the measure by which these interactions conditioned their cultural evolutions.

Caulk, Grady (Corps of Engineers) [236] Archaic in South Florida As part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project (CERP) the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District commissioned an update of the Archeological Context and a Cultural Resource Overview and Survey Strategy for the CERP area. Only four Early Archaic and 13 Middle Archaic sites were identified out of the 1,700 pre-Columbian sites recorded in the study area. This paper examines the survey strategies and site evaluation methods used to identify pre-ceramic Archaic sites in South Florida.

Other vessel forms, such as grater bowls, have received little attention as to their actual use by the Maya. Instead, ethnohistoric and ethnographic analogy of indigenous Mexican populations suggests that they were used to crush chilies. While the Maya may have used grater bowls to crush chilies, they may have been used to process other foods. This poster demonstrates that the Maya grater bowls were used to process animals and plants. Cerezo-Roman, Jessica (University of Arizona) [158] Mortuary Practices and Personhood among the Hohokam of Southern Arizona Previous research on mortuary practices in the Southwest largely has focused on the identification of a single aspect of identity. This study employs an intersectional approach looking at the individual as a member of different social networks using the concept of personhood. I contrast the biological profile of individuals with posthumous treatment of the body at two Preclassic Hohokam sites in the Tucson Basin. Preliminary results suggest that social age and gender were emphasized by the mourners. In addition, I look at how transformations in practices and perceptions of the body and individual personhood were accomplished through mortuary rituals.

Middle Sicán elite tomb has allowed us to reconstruct much of the complex, funerary process. This study shows the careful planning of this tomb from the placement, construction, and decoration of the tomb to cautious placement and organization of diverse grave contents. The funerary process continued long after the primary interment with a sequence of natural and cultural events, including rains, ritualized burning of ground surfaces, and the placement of diverse offerings over centuries. Ritualized funerary process seems to have served as mechanisms of preserving memory of the deceased through materialization. Chacaltana, Sofia (University of Illinois at Chicago) [121] Using LA-ICP-MS Method to Observe Imperial ­ Local Dynamics in the Upper Moquegua Valley during Inca Occupation During the Inca incorporation of the Moquegua Valley in southern Peru, the groups inhabiting this area went through an intense socioeconomic transformation that was reflected in the material culture of the region. I present preliminary analyses conducted at the Elemental Analysis Facility at the Chicago Field Museum to determine chemical readings from ceramic sherds collected from storehouses of an Inca waystation and an adjacent local community. This data shows that the empire was using foreign objects (vessels) in new socio-political contexts but continued utilizing local clay sources to manufacture vessels for their imperial activities.

Five hundred eighty-three archaeological sites were identified during Phase I survey. Forty-three of those sites were subject to Phase II testing and nine sites were recommended eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

We draw on evidence of architectural history and structural damage, room, plaza, and midden depositional histories, and natural site formation processes from both early and later Pueblo IV villages to compare the occupational conditions, extent, and nature of these different contexts. We characterize variability in the causes and outcomes of both pre-occupational and post-occupational burning episodes during this period, which implicate conflict as well as accidental fires.

Surviving structures can illustrate social hierarchy. Through architecture, the site of Panquilma illustrates the existence of social stratification. Aerial photos depict the size and complexity of the site. Ground mapping techniques help to establish the variation of structures within. Comparisons amongst each household confirm the dialectics between the common and elite. Common structures generally have: smaller rooms and closed-off quarters. Elite structures generally have: larger rooms, multiple plazas, middens and an open floor plan. Regional comparisons provide guidelines to the identification of Panquilma`s elite structures.

In contrast, archaic sites in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico show the increased use of milling equipment by soon after 8000 B.P.

Charlton, Michael (University College London) [256] The Role of Skill in the Evolution of Ironmaking Technology: Examples from Iron Age and late Medieval northwest Wales The inference of skill-level from bloomery iron smelting artifacts, especially slag, requires the analysis of both yield efficiency and standardization. A comparison of iron smelting activities from Iron Age and late medieval bloomeries in northwest Wales shows that skillfulness is strongly associated with production intensity. While Iron Age smelting recipes gradually evolve to fit an optimal economic strategy, skillfulness amongst ironmasters does not improve. Late medieval recipes, however, rapidly evolve in concert with increasing control of furnace operating conditions. These results imply that ironmaking ability is developed through repeated performance and that skillfulness hitchhikes with adaptive iron production strategies.

[18] What is a Huaca? When is a Huaca? Material complexities of Andean numina defied Spanish colonial explanation, due to historically deep and persistent semiotic and ontological notions of the referential function of symbols and the ultimately incommensurable natures of the agentive and the material. Data from various highland areas show that understanding huaca ontology requires considering the diversity of entities deemed huacas and the temporal conditions of a huaca`s being. Huacas were divine entities, intrinsically material, but unrestricted by or to any particular thing; partitive, but without sharp differentiation between signifier and signified. A brief conclusion suggests how this understanding of huacas may be useful in archaeological fieldwork. Chastain, Matthew (Northwestern University), Alix Deymier (Northwestern University), David Dunand (Northwestern University) and James Brown (Northwestern University) [140] Materials Science Analysis of Copper Artifacts from Cahokia's Mound 34 With the purpose of explaining the techniques used by Mississippian copper workers to reduce nuggets of native copper into thin sheets, copper artifacts deriving from the copper workshop site at Cahokia`s Mound 34 were subjected to metallographic analysis. Replication experiments were then conducted to attempt to recreate features seen on the artifacts under controlled conditions. This research confirmed that sheets were thinned through cycles of hammering and annealing, identified a method used to cut the sheets into shape, explored several relevant aspects of copper`s material behavior, and, more generally, demonstrated a procedure for using the methods of materials science to address archaeological questions. Chatfield, Melissa (Stanford) [137] Connecting Wari and Inca through Pottery Style and Technology The influence that the Wari Empire had on the later Inca Empire in terms of statecraft is a source of scholarly debate in the Cuzco region. The dataset presented here examines lineage iconography present on the tunics of ancestor figurines found at the Cuzco site of Pikillacta (Wari) and traces these design elements using pottery associated with ancestor worship during the Late Intermediate Period and Late Horizon at the multi-component site of Choquepukio, also in the Cuzco Valley. Feasting vessel morphology/technology is compared for the Middle Horizon, Late Intermediate Period, and Late Horizon to demonstrate continuity of Wari practices into Inca times with technological innovation.

Early efforts focused on using aerial images to identify earthworks or segments of earthworks that were not clearly visible, due to their great size and topographic subtlety, on the ground. More recently, efforts have concentrated on documenting landscape modifications that resulted from 130 years of agricultural practices and on understanding alterations caused by ongoing natural geologic processes. The latter use is important as an aid in managing the archaeological resource. The temporal resolution of the aerial photographs ranges from 1934 to 2004. Cheruvelil, Jubin (Michigan State University) [46] Subsistence Decision-Making in Heterogenous Environments: Foraging Simulation in Saginaw Bay Watershed, MI Late Archaic, Early and Middle Woodland hunter-gatherers in Saginaw Basin of Michigan are observed to buffer against environmental variation by resource specialization, mobility and diet strategies. This research tests these past interpretations using a landscape based resource model. Forager behaviors are simulated using historical and idealized landscapes by an agent based approach with the aid of ArcGis and Agent Analyst tool kits. The resulting behavioral patterns are then compared against archaeological site and subsistence data. The statistical evaluation of simulations using archaeological data suggests niche based strategies that vary both spatially and temporally to cope with environmental variability. Chesley, John T.

There are few well-documented sites in the Americas where such sympatry occurs. In 1916, prominent anthropologists, such as Ales Hrdlicka, dismissed the human remains as younger, intrusive burials. However, the rare earth elements (REE) taken up during fossilization by the extinct fauna and the human remains at the Vero site are statistically indistinguishable, thus confirming the coexistence of humans and extinct fauna in Florida.

LA-ICP-MS analysis of a sample of the beads by Dussubieux indicate that most of the beads were imported Middle Eastern soda glass made with plant ash.

Throughout the Middle Paleolithic layers these variables correlate negatively, following patterns found in other parts of Eurasia, but when contrasted with the Acheulo-Yabrudian there is an abrupt change, with no correlation evident. This change could reflect differing modes of site provisioning and organization of mobility, a hypothesis that appears to be supported through other lines of evidence from Tabun.

Teasing apart the contributions of prehistoric and historic introductions to modern Oceanic sweet potato diversity is also important.

Research Geophysical survey at Poverty Point by the authors has identified a diverse set of geophysical features, some of them unexpected, and has stimulated the process of explaining them. As a group they complement the earthworks and emphasize that mound building, long felt to be the most significant activity at the site, was accompanied by off-mound activities with extensive construction. The realization that these exist, supplemented by excavations essential to understanding them, is expanding and changing our conception of terminal Archaic life. Cleghorn, Naomi [234] see Janzen, Anneke Cleland, Robin [136] Of Godly Deer and Hunters` Fear: The Fauna from La Quemada Initial faunal results are presented from La Quemada, a large ceremonial center in Zacatecas, Mexico. Although the size and monumentality of the site suggest an elite presence, rare trade goods are not concentrated in and near the monumental core suggesting that a social stratification approach to faunal analysis may not be the most productive. Instead, this project explores how, and if, ethnographic analogy drawing on current Huichol religious beliefs, animal-use, and bone-disposal practice can inform interpretation of the archaeological faunal assemblage. Particular attention is paid to how size-class and differential disposal affects the faunal record, as well as to taphonomy.

In addition to a number of Magdalenian wall paintings and engravings and various engravings on the ground, human footprints and the hand prints of a child have been discovered, as well as the unique print of a shod foot. The preservation of the cave and the variety of Magdalenian traces and remains makes it an exceptional testimony of human actions underground at the end of the Pleistocene. Coats, Jennifer (Cal State LA) [148] The Stone House in the Cave: Analysis of a Speleothem Structure in Actun Yaxteel Ahau Surface survey and inventory of the upper level of Actun Yaxteel Ahau conducted during the spring of 2009 documented a number of elaborate speleothem structures. To this point, the analysis of speleothems has tended to consider only portable fragments, while these structures appear to have functioned as ritual features. This analysis considers one example that strongly resembles a house structure. The author considers the function of Lot 11 within the Maya concept of Na and the importance of the idea to the ancient Maya of a cave within a cave. Coats, Meredith (University of Cincinnati) [112] Architectural Development at a Classic Maya Secondary

Center, Say Kah, Belize Recent excavations at the Classic Maya secondary site Say Kah, located near the center La Milpa, focused on understanding the architectural development of the site and how the settlement related spatially and chronologically to nearby settlements. Architectural features including large benches and vaulted ceilings suggest a more complex group than hypothesized. Yet, in contrast to surrounding settlements, Group B of Say Kah appears to exhibit only a single phase of occupation. These discoveries allow for clearer understanding of Say Kah`s place in a regional community of related sites and the development of settlement in the La Milpa region. Cobean, Robert (INAH, MEXICO) [221] Symbolic Aspects of Epiclassic Obsidian Offerings in the Region of Tula, Hidalgo, Mexico During the Epiclassic (circa 600-900 A.D.) several transformations occurred in lithic industries of peoples in the region of Tula, Hidalgo. With the decline of the Teotihuacan state, the use of obsidian tools was largely replaced by the production of instruments from local materials such as rhyolite, chert, and basalt. A major Epiclassic use for obsidian objects was burial offerings. We propose explanations for changes in symbolic meanings of obsidian instruments in the Tula area.

Most researchers suggest that interaction across the vast Lapita world fell rapidly and the ensuing isolation of communities and their adaptation to local environments caused the loss of Lapita. To assess the isolationadaptation hypothesis for specific Lapita occupations, we should analyze fine-grained data on community interaction, local environmental and subsistence variation, and changes in ceramic use. New data from Tavua, Fiji, and other Lapita sites, are used to evaluate the isolation-adaptation hypothesis. Cockburn, Denton [19] see Kobti, Ziad Codding, Brian [118] see Zeanah, David W.

This has resulted in remarkable preservation of an ancestral Pueblo community center that was intensively occupied between A.D. 1000 and 1300. Many parts of this archaeological landscape are visible, including ancient roads, footpaths, agricultural fields, and water control features. We explore the utility of quantitatively analyzing various types of satellite imagery and geospatial support data to locate these large-scale archaeological landscape components. The techniques used, and their ground-truthed accuracies, will be discussed. Coffman, Sam (University of Alaska, Fairbanks) and Ben A.

Seasonal occupation at five Late Archaic (4,200-3,100 B.P.) shell rings along the Georgia coast is examined using oxygen isotopic profiles from hardhead catfish (Ariopsis felis) and Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) otoliths. Additionally, vertebrate remains are examined for seasonally sensitive taxa. These data indicate that at all five Late Archaic shell rings more than one season is represented and at several sites, all seasons are represented. This suggests that some portion of the population may have occupied the coast throughout the year during this period.

Sherds recovered from sites separated by wide distances show remarkable consistency in their manufacture, suggesting that many vessels were either produced from few geological sources or potters attempted to replicate a familiar paste with local materials. Variation in ceramic geochemistry is investigated by comparing results of Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis on 103 geological specimens against 162 potsherds sampled from regional Fremont sites, including Baker Village (26WP63), Five Finger Ridge (42Sv1686), and Evans Mound/Paragonah (42IN40/43).

Collar, Anna (University of Liverpool) [113] Networks, Epigraphy and Religious Change in the Jewish Diaspora I here take a network approach to the epigraphic material for the Jewish Diaspora in the Roman Empire. Inscriptions on stone are ideal for tracing social, cultural or religious change as and where it happened, and analysing their distribution with techniques from network analysis makes it is possible to discern patterns in the evidence that reveal processes of religious change over time and space. By looking again at the widely distributed epigraphy of the Jewish Diaspora I show that adoption of rabbinic reforms in the West was widespread, contra the viewpoint that the Western Diaspora was forgotten by the East.

This is perceived as the earth breathing and seen as proof that the earth is a living and sentient being. An examination of Classic Maya iconography documents a similar belief depicted in multiple media. The "breath of the mountain" is closely tied to the fundamentally important concept of life giving and life sustaining rain.

Three centuries before, Alexander the Great found no houses, fields, temples, or anthropomorphic images there. Agriculture and permanent settlements were eschewed. Trade by camel caravan over trackless desert was the engine of wealth. In contrast, Petra by AD 100 was filled with temples, houses, theaters, a nymphaeum, a paradeisos, and monumental tombs, all adorned with humans, animals, and the fruits of nature. Agricultural fields surrounded the city. We examine here the appearance of monumental structures and this transition from trade to agriculture.

and Northern Chihuahua Desert The groove and cupule rock art style is widely dispersed throughout the American Southwest and Northern Chihuahua desert. This rock art style is defined as boulder or rock slab covered with small rounded depressions (cupules), usually one or two inches in diameter and half-inch to an inch in depth, and/or linear grooves that are rarely more than a quarter-inch in depth. Archaeologists have speculated on the function of these groove marks, however, little research has focused on their purpose.

In examining these remains and archival documentation, I trace the decrease in informal systems of community land use and building strategies, and the later emergence of a more formalized process of decision-making by both tenants and owners. The formalization was accompanied by the rapid depopulation of the upland hilly interior townland due to disease and immigration, followed by a shift to coastal areas and new road systems closer to the sea.

I argue that the shape and size of Huari shrines are similar throughout the empire and as such represent the intersection between ritual and sovereignty. Portable objects and an iconography depicting the pageantry of empire provide a back drop to the activities identified in the archaeological remains of the shrines that include human and animal sacrifices combined with libations and burning events. Hence, regional Huari sanctuaries and their contents are metaphorically linked to the principal shrine and seat of power.

Craig, Jessica (University of Kansas) [112] Changing Perceptions of the Built Landscape: Evidence for the Ritualization of Reused Structures and Monuments at the Ancient Maya Site of San Bartolo, Guatemala This work illustrates how the ancient Maya of San Bartolo constructed and reconstructed their cultural landscape over the course of the sites` decidedly turbulent occupational history. The varying ceremonial treatment of buildings and monuments across the site expresses the community`s shifting notions about the past, the present, and the future. More specifically, the residents of San Bartolo utilized both veneration and termination rites as a means for rectifying these changing perspectives. Furthermore, paleoethnobotanical evidence from excavations across San Bartolo indicates that they employed a kind of ritual tool kit in the execution of otherwise distinct religious rites.

We explore the dedicatory deposits of kivas and their intentional retirement (possibly with termination deposits), usually by burning, followed by toppling the walls. The dedicatory objects are relatively consistent in Mimbres great kivas, especially during the Three Circle phase, AD 800-1000, with most objects such as shell bracelets and quartz crystals being broken prior to placement in floor, wall, or roof adobe. Termination deposits other than pottery vessels and objects left on floors are more difficult to identify but may include pottery vessels and dismembered dogs.

The results of this study stress the urgent need for additional interviews, before critical information is lost forever. Crews, Christopher (Texas A&M University) [161] Obsidian Procurement in the Piedra Lumbre Valley: 130 Obsidian bifaces from GR-2 GR-2, Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, has revealed at least 3 meters of deposition. 130 obsidian bifaces, including complete and fragmented points, have undergone X-Ray Flourescence. The results show a reliance on Jemez and Polvadura sources throughout the occupation of the rockshelter. Outliers further our understanding of the mobility and trade practices of the inhabitants of the Piedra Lumbre Valley over the last 4000 years. Crider, Andrea (Environment & Archaeology, LLC) [55] The Use of Residue Analysis in Determining Resource Procurement Strategies: A View from Appalachia Recent excavations at a mountaintop site (46Bo419) in Boone County, West Virginia revealed components dating from the Early Archaic to Late Woodland cultural periods. Various forms of pedoturbation, logging, and looting have disturbed stratigraphy across much of the site. Residue analysis performed on lithic tools, pottery sherds, and pitted stones provided key data concerning resource procurement at the site, including data that did not support commonly held theories of nut mast utilization in Appalachian upland settings. These results could have interesting implications to broader mobility and resource procurement patterns of the understudied interior uplands of southwest West Virginia. Crider, Destiny (Arizona State University) [161] Pottery Paints and Technological Traditions: PIXE Characterization of Central Mexican Epiclassic and Early Postclassic Pottery Surface paints of red and cream painted Epiclassic (ca. A.D. 650850) and Early Postclassic (ca. A.D. 850-1150) pottery from the Basin of Mexico are examined using particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), a non-destructive method of identifying chemical composition of archaeological materials. The samples are representative of diachronic and regional variants from Coyotlatelco, Mazapan/Tollan, and Early Postclassic Chalco-Cholula complexes. Chemical signatures are used to examine spatially and temporally discernable micro-variation among of paint and slip recipes among diagnostic pottery types. Spatial patterns in pigment recipes may reflect the degree of shared technological traditions evident across the region within each complex. Crist, Walter (Arizona State University) [183] Beyond the Rules: An Archaeology of Board Games in the Eastern Mediterranean Despite being an artifact class that is quickly becoming ubiquitous at Bronze Age sites in the Eastern Mediterranean, game boards have received remarkably little treatment in the archaeological literature. This poster examines the spread of the Egyptian games senet and mehen, which spread throughout the Levant and Cyprus during the Early Bronze Age. Through comparison of the morphology and social contexts of these games in Egypt, Cyprus, and southern Canaan, conclusions can be made about the nature of interaction between the cultures. Game boards provide a unique a avenue for studying trade relations, since they show the flow of ideas without an explicit commercial component. Crompton, Amanda (Memorial University of Newfoundland) [219] The Finest Beach: The Changing Landscape at a French Fisheries Colony in Plaisance, Newfoundland, Canada (1662-1713) In 1662, a French colony was officially established in Plaisance, Newfoundland, Canada, to encourage and protect the vitality of France`s overseas cod-fishing industry. The development of the French settlement at Plaisance will be reconstructed with archaeological and historical evidence. The colony was shaped both by its physical topography and by the competing demands of the

people who lived and worked there. Co-operation and conflict between Plaisance`s permanent residents, seasonal fishing crews, military detachments, and administrative personnel shaped the colony`s developmental trajectory. As a result, Plaisance was an atypical settlement that stands in marked contrast to other fishing settlements in Newfoundland. Cross, Sarah [121] see Vaughn, Kevin J. Crossland, Nicole (University of Montana) [39] The Evolution of Domestic Economies at the Bridge River site: A Lithic Perspective The rise of social inequality has been a topic of interest for Fraser Plateau archaeologists for some time and can also be demonstrated at the Bridge River site. The extensive dating at the Bridge River site enables researchers to examine the village intensively through several occupation periods. This research aims to understand the ways in which domestic economies have evolved in relation to the rise of social inequality. More specifically, the paper examines change in lithic tool production and use systems associated with domestic activity areas in large and small houses spanning the transition to inter-household ranking within the village.

The light station became operational in 1875, and through the years experienced periods of construction, modification, and destruction. Today, the BLM has embarked on an ambitious restoration effort at PBLS. Through consultation with the California Office of Historic Preservation, the BLM has resolved adverse effects to the historic and prehistoric sites on the property. This paper will demonstrate how restoration at PBLS has embodied the conservation and preservation goals of the NLCS system. Cui, Jianfeng [175] see Hung, Ling-yu Cui, Yaping [214] see Dong, Yu Cullen Cobb, Kim [26] Riveting Technology! This poster covers research and documentation of a group of Mississippian sheet copper ornaments from the collection of the Smithsonian Institution`s National Museum of the American Indian. The application of rivets to finely crafted copper sheet ornaments is widespread during the Mississippian. The ornaments in this study are hammered into sheets and subsequently embellished with symbolic motifs. Rivets are used to join layers of copper during sheet production sequences or repair fractures or losses in the ornament. Careful examination of rivet application reveals fabrication sequences, starting with the original production of copper sheet, through extensive and ongoing repairs. Culleton, Brendan (University of Oregon), Bruce Winterhalder (University of California, Davis), Cedric Puleston (University of California, Davis) and Douglas Kennett (University of Oregon) [197] The Ideal Free/Despotic Distributions, Social Network Theory and Intensification in the Ancient Maya Dual Economy The development of dual economies, where intensive production serves goals of both domestic subsistence and surplus production for the prestige economy, is a significant but theoretically underexamined aspect of the emergence, integration and transformation of ancient Maya socioeconomic systems. We invoke the Ideal Free and Despotic Distribution models from Human Behavioral Ecology (HBE) and elements of Social Network Theory to examine the tempo and mode of Maya socioeconomic intensification. The theoretical aim is to outline a framework that maintains HBE`s methodological individualism and ecological foundation while accounting for multiple currencies (e.g., calories, status, reproductive success) operating at diverse scales of socioeconomic organization (e.g., individual, household, polity, region). Culleton, Brendan [250] see Kennett, Douglas J. Culley, Elisabeth [22] Models of Pleistocene Image Production and Its Social Consequences: A Defense of Semiotics in Rock Art Research Archaeologists have long flirted with semiotics as a promising heuristic for interpreting prehistoric art and largely with disappointing results. Many semiotic tenets have proven theoretically unsound,

while others are difficult to operationalize in archaeological contexts. This paper returns to semiotics as a way of delineating the cognitive entailments of image-making practices and their social consequences and as a source of rigorous and testable hypotheses. Semiotic models for the initial emergence of non-utilitarian object production and use (artistic expression) and the cognitive relationships among these and other Pleistocene behaviors are presented. Broader applications of a semiotic research program are also discussed.

A glimpse at economic activity in one structure, represented by pollen analysis, indicates processing native resources such as nettle, marshelder, and basswood. Phytoliths recovered from stratigraphic samples hint at the availability of wild rice or a close relative. Organic residues examined from ceramics broaden our understanding of diet with evidence of meat, cultigens, and wild plants. Residue on a scraper, identified as fish scales, indicates scaling perch and suckers.

Antonio (The Field Museum) [116] Archaeological Correlates in the Study of Social Stratification: The Cases of Central Place Theory and Ceremonial Centers Since early on American Archaeology has used a series of correlates to identify and understand social stratification in ancient societies. In this paper, I review two of these correlates: (1) centralized settlement patterns and the use of Central Place Theory and (2) the presence of ceremonial centers. The main argument of the paper is that these two correlates are being used very mechanically and without any discrimination to identify the presence of social stratification, even when other evidence against it exists. After discussing these correlates conceptually, I present ethnographic cases that contradict them. The paper ends with a case study from the Caribbean, the ceremonial center of Tibes. Curewitz, Diane (Washington State Univ.) and R.G. Matson (University of British Columbia) [84] The 13th Century Depopulation of Cedar Mesa: The View from Ceramic Design Previous Cedar Mesa tree-ring dates and ceramic seriations did not explicate the relationship between terminal mesa-top and canyon occupations and the process of depopulation. Using seven design elements (including "rim ticks") developed by M. Hegmon to date assemblages from southwestern Colorado, these ambiguities are resolved; the mesa was essentially abandoned as a unit circa 1250, although Moon House appears to be a later exception. Simultaneous seriation of Central Mesa Verde and Cedar Mesa Pueblo III sites shows close parallels in timing of design element changes, although element abundances vary between the two areas. Curran, Sabrina [205] see Belmaker, Miriam Curta, Florin (University of Florida) [243] Ethnicity in Medieval Archaeology A resurgence of interest in ethnicity in medieval archaeology has recently re-opened the debate surrounding the ability of archaeologists to "get into the minds" of medieval people. The debate was ignited by the idea that archaeologists have no access to the

meaning of cultural traditions. The theoretical malaise at the root of this scepticism verging on nihilism shows that medieval archaeology still has to come to terms with such key concepts as symbols, style, and power. The paper offers a brief survey of the most recent developments in the field. Curtis, Jason [153] see Brenner, Mark Curtis, Jenneth (Parks Canada), Adrian Burke (Université de Montréal), Jamie Brake (Torngâsok Cultural Centre) and Pierre Desrosiers (Avataq Cultural Institute) [147] Documenting the Ramah Chert Quarries in Torngat Mountains National Park of Canada Ramah chert is a distinctive material for chipped stone technology that is well-known for its wide distribution across archaeological sites in eastern North America. Recent fieldwork is increasing our knowledge of several aspects of the quarry sites. This paper provides a review and update on the quarries as a contribution to the international inventory. We explore the geology of the chert outcrops and evidence of cultural activity. This information is further placed within the context of the period of use, products created, and geographical range over which they were distributed. Cushman, David (SRI Foundation) [3] First Chair [3] First Moderator; [3] first organizer Cuthrell, Rob (UC Berkeley) [154] Foodways, Practices, Colonial Experiences, and Elusive Identities: A Comparative Approach Many archaeologists have acknowledged the foodways/practice/ identity nexus as an important space for political and social negotiation in colonial settings. However, because identities are multifaceted, multiscalar, and dynamic, exploring them using archaeological remains involves much uncertainty and ambivalence. This is particularly evident in colonial settings, where identities and identity-signaling practices were often central discursive problems. Using examples from colonial and post-colonial contexts from the east and west coasts of North America, this essay will explore how these issues affect archaeological interpretation. Cutright, Robyn (Centre College) [137] Domestic Ritual in a Provincial Chimu Community, Jequetepeque Valley, Peru This poster explores small-scale domestic ritual in the LIP village of Pedregal, in the Jequetepeque Valley on the north coast of Peru. A wide range of rituals at multiple scales, from small offerings of burnt maize within houses to community-wide feasts, were integral to community life at Pedrega. The use of exotic materials in intimate household-based ritual acts drew Pedregal residents into contact with wider spheres of interaction, while feasting in the public sector of the site served to reinforce integrative community ties. Cutright-Smith, Elisabeth (University of Arizona), Kacy Hollenback and Wendi Field Murray [7] Twenty Years Later: A Quantitative Assessment of NAGPRA's Impacts on American Archaeology The passage of NAGPRA in 1990 forever changed the discipline of archaeology. This legislation mandated repatriation of human remains and certain objects found on federal or tribal lands to culturally affiliated descendant communities, as well as those items in the possession of agencies and museums receiving federal funding. Yet twenty years later, we still do not have a clear picture of how this legislation has collectively changed the discipline in terms of method, theory, or practice. This paper seeks to understand the magnitude and direction of these changes through a quantitative content analysis of major anthropological and archaeological journals. Cyphers, Ann (IIA-UNAM) [156] Subsistence Strategies at San Lorenzo Food production strategies in the lower Coatzacoalcos River drainage are risky due to unexpected fluctuations in environmental conditions.

In the early phases, the San Lorenzo Olmec diversified in a wide spectrum of resources in a mixed economy that incorporates fishing, hunting, and collecting with arboriculture and upland root crop cultivation. As subsistence demands increased through the Early Preclassic period, wetland resource withdrawal and production intensified, and maize agriculture in the wetlands became increasingly attractive despite its higher degree of risk from unpredictable flooding. Cyr, Howard (The Department of Archaeology) [111] Geoarchaeological Research along the Oldman River, Southern Alberta Few early-middle Holocene age archaeological sites have been identified across the Northern Plains, leading archaeologists to speculate as to the effects postglacial environmental change had on the habitability of the area and on differential site preservation. Little is known about the development of Northern Plains river systems following the draining of the glacial lakes or about the impacts that river evolution may have had on both site selection by prehistoric groups and site preservation. This paper investigates the evolution of the Oldman River drainage in southern Alberta and addresses the possible impacts of alluvial activity on archaeological site preservation.

da Gloria, Pedro [47] see Strauss, André Daehnke, Jon (Stanford University) [225] Places of Protocol: Lived Heritage, Memory and Materiality on the Columbia River There is increased demand by Indigenous populations for control of heritage, especially in accordance with their own practices and protocols. While non-indigenous views on heritage often remain attached to the primacy of archaeological objects, it is often these forms of intangible heritage ­ protocol and practice ­ that are most relevant to Indigenous communities. This paper explores the Chinook Nation`s efforts at cultural reclamation, especially their emphasis on "lived heritage". This is demonstrated most clearly by the resurgence of canoe culture, the rebirth of communal longhouses, and most importantly the teaching of the protocols associated with being Chinook. Daggett, Adrianne (Michigan State University) [53] The Chronology of Exchange: An Example from Early Iron Age Southern Africa Research on exchange between forager and agropastoralist communities in the southern African Iron Age focuses on how exchange affects social organization and subsistence for both communities. Spatial and cultural associations between forager and agropastoralist sites are well-documented, but sufficiently tight chronology to demonstrate temporal correlation is often missing. The material record represents relatively short-term events, from which long-term processes are extrapolated. The disparity between the activities represented and their interpretation makes addressing cultural and economic exchange problematic. This paper will consider chronology, inter-site correlation, and interpretation for a better understanding of the dynamics of interaction in Iron Age southern Africa.

[124] see Milligan, Colleen Dahdul, Mariam (University of California, Santa Barbara) [56] Possible Ecological Factors Affecting Variability within the Cahuilla Mortuary System Much of the variability observed in mortuary remains has been attributed to social complexity or status differentiation. What some studies have not taken into account are ecological factors that may have influenced mortuary practices, specifically among prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups. Within the Cahuilla mortuary system, there may have been a relationship between variability and ecological conditions. This paper will explore whether or not ecological conditions at the time of a Cahuilla individual's death was a factor in determining how much energy and material wealth the social group was willing or able to expend on the funerary process. Dahlin, Bruce (Ancient Maya Environmental Studies Center) [5] A Tale of Three Cities: Revisiting the AD 536 Event in the Maya Lowlands Climate scientists and historians have long known that starting in AD 536 a dust veil blanketed the earth, causing extremely debilitating climate changes, crop failures and famines throughout much of the northern hemisphere. Empirical data of various sorts now show that its effects drastically altered climates for a short, but significant, time in the Maya lowlands, and there are reasons to believe that Maya societies were forced to adapt to these changes in ways that fundamentally changed the course of Maya prehistory. This paper will review the data from Tikal, Caracol and Calakmul, the largest reigning polities at that time. [178] see Magnoni, Aline; [20] see Terry, Richard E.

By analyzing and comparing the rates of the complete Rio Muerto M70B Omo skeletal assemblage for the presence and severity of caries, calculus, abscesses, enamel hypoplasia, and attrition with the rates of local and foreign populations of known subsistence strategies, results are suggestive of an agropastoralist economy. With the integration of botanical evidence, as well as previous dietary studies conducted on Chen Chen and Tiwanaku populations, an inter-dependent relationship between all three communities is suggested.

The purpose of this paper is to reevaluate the Roman tesserae, primarily lead or bronze tokens of approximately the first and second centuries AD, in light of modern theories and apply knowledge of them to the study of the Roman economy. To this end, the study analyzes a sample of 2400 pieces from the British Museum and other collections.

We use electromagnetic and electrical methods to locate sites and to identify concentrations of architecture. Once identified and confirmed, we use Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) to define specific structures. Developing GPR as an excavation tool in Iceland has its challenges. The most important methodological refinements have been the mechanical removal of the surface grass; close transects spacing; and appropriate processing of the data using GPR-Slice software. These refinements make GPR an indispensible tool for the excavation of Viking Age turf farmsteads in Iceland. Damp, Jonathan [213] Daily Practice and Early Southwest Domestic Space This study reviews attempts to analyze domestic space during the Late Archaic and Basketmaker periods in the Southwest. I focus on the use of space within pitstructures and ephemeral structures on the Colorado Plateau from the Zuni/Cibola area, Black Mesa, and Grand Canyon. Various methods of analysis are provided to show how social organization through gender or economy (farming versus foraging) may have contributed to the use of domestic space. A GISbased approach best offers insight into daily practice in the early Southwest.

By employing an approach that combines 461 tree-ring dates with a geographic information systembased (GIS) map we have re-defined previous interpretations of the site. As a result, new information on population growth at Tijeras Pueblo, important to exploring aggregation as a process, is slowly unfolding.

Five of the six individuals depicted and their home cities have been identified. But who is the sixth figure? And why is a young woman engaged in auto-sacrifice? This paper examines the vase together with relevant data accumulated over the past half century, to answer those questions as well as how a nice Chama Polychrome from the country made it down river to a tomb in the big city of Altar de Sacrificios, and why it's important. Danis, Ann (Barnard College) [235] Pictured Tipi Site: Biographical Tradition Rock-art in Northern New Mexico This poster reports on a previously undocumented tradition of Western Plains rock art in northern New Mexico. Two seasons of rock art survey in the Rio Grande Gorge have brought to light dozens of detailed images of battles, tipis, horses, parfleches, and other material culture scratched onto basalt boulders. Following the Biographical Tradition known in the Western Plains, the image s recount specific events, represent tallies, and express individual identities and tribal affiliations through stylistic detail. As such, they raise important questions regarding changing attitudes towards identity, landscape, and the construction of personal archives during the turbulent early colonial period.

Mid-level settlements (not quite urban, not quite rural) have often been neglected in water management studies in Mesoamerica that attempt to investigate a representative sample of hydrological features and configurations by focusing on the extreme ends of the urban/rural continuum. Recent archaeological research at Palmarejo, a mid-level settlement, has revealed an unexpected degree of water management complexity involving the use of limestone sinks. Darling, J Andrew (Gila River Indian Community) and Robert Valencia (Pascua Yaqui Tribe) [225] Return to Bacatete: Yaqui Resistance, Reconciliation, and International Repatriation In 1902, the physical anthropologist, Ales Hrdlicka, armed with a letter from Porfirio Díaz and under the aegis of the Hyde Expedition for the American Museum of Anthropology, removed the physical remains and possessions of Yaqui genocide victims from the site of Cerro Mazatán, Sonora. Today, negotiation for their repatriation resides in multiple overlapping political arenas. Some scholars may accuse Hrdlicka of anthropological racism, but such statements are political obfuscations, which downplay tragic historical realities and Yaqui memory.

Darras, Véronique [221] Ritual and Trivial Uses of Obsidian: The Symbolic Dimensions of Blades among the Tarascans By the 13th century, prismatic blades become a common artifact among the Tarascans from Zacapu, Michoacan. The study of their spatial distribution at the site of Las Milpillas shows an undifferentiated distribution in both domestic and ritual contexts. Through these archaeological examples and ethnohistorical data, the symbolic dimension of the blade is considered. Two hypotheses are conceived: 1) the "banalization" of the prismatic blade is compatible with uses other than trivial (especially for bloodletting and ritual cutting of hair); 2) the consumption of green blades from a regional source is probably linked to the symbolism associated with that color.

In this paper I argue that the Aztatlán phenomenon of the Pacific littoral can best be understood as a series of local developments taking advantage of the Postclassic International style in order to generate idiosyncratic claims to legitimacy, rather than as an overriding wave of influence` from Central Mexico. Davenport, James (Tulane University) and Kit Nelson (Tulane University) [137] Cuchimilcos and their Role in Interment Ritual for the Chancay Cuchimilcos have long been recognized as a marker of the Chancay Culture of the north central coast of Peru. Although they are part of the burial ritual, little has been ascertained about the role or significance of cuchimilcos. Specific attributes are examined in light of recent finds including excavations of a tomb near the town of Rontoy in the Huaura Valley and an x-ray fluorescence study of red paint found on both excavated and museum samples of human remains and cuchimilcos. From these data, aspects of internment ritual for the Chancay culture are examined. Davies, Diane (Tulane University) [175] The Value of Chemical Analysis in Understanding the Function and thus Activities carried out in Ancient Structures: Results from the Maya site of San Bartolo, Petén, Guatemala Artifacts collected in excavations are often used by archaeologists to determine a structure`s function. The results can be misleading as artifacts are most often found in secondary depositional contexts. Fortunately chemical signatures are mostly left in primary contexts even when all evidence of past activities has disappeared. Over 300 floor samples from an architectural group in the ancient Maya site of San Bartolo were analyzed for phosphate and potassium. The results, combined with architectural morphology, associated features, and artifacts, proved successful in determining activities carried out in the individual rooms and thus the function of the structures as a whole.

Historic and ethnographic accounts describe farming and herding communities who understood their shared identity and territorial rights as (1) established by ancestors, and (2) conceptualized through relationships with living landscape features. My excavations at Yuthu, a Formative period village in Cusco, Peru (400-100 BC) uncovered a sunken court, ritual canals, and 21 human burials that are material remnants of ceremonial practices shaped by similar ideology early villagers used to establish, renegotiate, and remember their place and privilege in the world. Davis, Hester (Arkansas Archeological Survey), and Glen Akridge (Arkansas Archeological Society) [38] 85 Years of Contributions by Amateur Archeologists in Arkansas Contributions by amateur archeologists to preserving Arkansas's past began in 1925, when Sam Dellinger, Professor of Zoology and head of the University of Arkansas Museum, found that museums in the east were accumulating large collections of Arkansas's prehistoric artifacts. He began an effort to save archeological sites and artifacts for Arkansans. With the creation of the Arkansas Archeological Society in 1960 and the Arkansas Archeological Survey in 1967, these efforts intensified. Amateur contributions continue to this day largely because of the successful Society/Survey Training Program now in its 45th year.

Though crossculturally such urbanization often signals a disconnect from pastoral activities, such is not the case in Muru Ut Pata. Traditional models of social complexity hold that meat-provisioning leads to the emergence of hierarchical systems of distribution. Data from Muru Ut Pata, however, suggests that members of non-elite households had direct access to whole animal carcasses. This paper explores the nature of heterarchical power achieved by residential groups through close connections with camelid herds. [245] Second Chair [245] Second Organizer

Late Pleistocene-aged deposits are contained in all three caves, but are best exhibited in Cave 5. Cave 5 late Pleistocene-aged deposits are primarily comprised of aeolian dust influx and coarse clastic roof fall materials, reflected in lithostratigraphic unit 1a, and a deposit of reworked packrat midden materials combined with aeolian, colluvial, and alluvial deposits, which are designated as lithostratigraphic unit 1b.

Davis, Miriam (Delta State University) [51] Kathleen Kenyon and Women Archaeologists of the British Empire Women were prominent in the archaeology of the British Empire. In the early twentieth century archaeology was still primarily an amateur pursuit; paid positions were rare. Women with independent means could pursue archaeology almost as easily as men. Dame Kathleen Kenyon (1906-78) both made an important methodological contribution to the new discipline and excavated a site that changed scholarly understanding of prehistory. In the 1950s her excavations at Jericho pushed back the accepted date of town life by at least 2000 years and were instrumental in spreading the Wheeler-Kenyon method to the Middle East, where it has continued to influence archaeological field work to the present day. Davis, Sara (Archaeological Investigations Northwest) [108] Stacked rock features along the Columbia River of Oregon and Washington Stacked rock features are typically difficult to evaluate in terms of function and age. Ethnographic and historical information indicate a wide diversity in both functions and ages for these types of archaeological features. Hundreds of stacked rock features have been recently identified in the Southern Columbia Plateau of Oregon and Washington, located in the Columbia Hills and on the broad terrace along the Columbia River. This large data set provides a unique opportunity to assess the function and age of rock features in this area. Analysis of these stacked rock features compares their geographic locations, morphology, size, and associated artifacts to provide general characterizations of stacked rock features in this region.

Dayton, Chris (Cox|McLain Environmental Consulting, Inc.) [231] Excavations at Site 41DL203: New Data on the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric in North-Central Texas The prehistoric archaeology of North-Central Texas remains marked by serious gaps in basic knowledge about subsistence regimes, chronology, settlement patterns, exchange, and paleoenvironment, even in relatively recent periods such as the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric. The region`s archaeology has lagged behind that of neighboring areas, due in part to a lack of multidisciplinary investigations of stratified sites. Recent data recovery excavations at Site 41DL203, a stratified 2,500-year series of near-channel occupations on Rowlett Creek in Dallas County, provide important new data that allow us to more confidently address some of these gaps.

De La Fuente, Guillermo [23] The Abaucán Sur Research Project: initial stages in the collaboration between archaeologists and archaeometrists (Dpto. Tinogasta, Provincia de Catamarca, Argentina). The Abaucán Sur research project began two years ago in the context of exploration and research of a new geographical area. This geographical area was almost entirely unexplored until the 70`s with some few archaeological sites being known and investigated. Most of the archaeological evidence known from this area belongs to the Late (ca. AD 900 ­ AD 1200) and Inka (ca. AD 1480 ­ AD 1532) Periods of Northwestern Argentine region. One of the goals of the project focused in the development of an archaeometry program involving the studding of different types of artefacts, mainly ceramic, to understand certain aspects of ceramic production organization for these two periods (raw materials use, manufacture, function, and trade). The integration of the classical archaeological evidence and the archeometrical data is an ongoing work we are developing at this stage of the project. This paper is concerned with the exploration of the several ways archaeologists do this integration, paying especial attention to the links with local communities they are working in.

Dean, Rebecca (University of Minnesota-Morris) [16] The Mesolithic/Neolithic Transition in Coastal Portugal In Portugal, Mesolithic shellfisher/gatherers persisted in marine environments after domestic economies were established in the interior. It is difficult to generalize about Mesolithic and Neolithic resource use, since faunal remains reflect the variation in terrestrial and marine species available to inhabitants of rocky shores, sandy estuary environments, and inland sites. Where regional trends are masked by variability in available resources, measures of energetic return prove easier to compare than more traditional zooarchaeological data. Assemblages from Mesolithic and Neolithic sites show a general trend toward lower energetic returns from wild resources, whether in shifting species compositions, or in diminution of shellfish.

Migration Production of material goods across space and time should have correlates in the out-migration of people from the Northern Southwest during the thirteenth-century. We aim to link the out-migration of the Mesa Verde region to variation in projectile point morphology by mathematically characterizing the shape of the bases of side -and corner-notched points from the central Mesa Verde and the Northern Rio Grande regions. Along with data regarding projectile point variation as well as temporal and spatial controls, we utilize Bayesian statistics and network graph analysis to examine cultural transmission and migration in the VEP II study areas.

Yet, most southern lowland states simply collapsed. The Cancuen citystate hegemony, however, began a very early transition in political economy and exchange systems in the eight century.

Natural fire plays an important role in Pacific Northwest ecosystems. Regional ethnographic data also depict the importance of humaninduced fire to increase plant productivity and shape surrounding landscapes. One of the most difficult tasks that researchers face when reconstructing fire history is determining if fires were natural or anthropogenic in origin. Fine-grained localized macrocharcoal data can provide us with a better view of anthropogenic fire. Macrocharcoal analyses coupled with climatic and archaeological data from Shingle Point, Valdes Island, suggest that pre-contact peoples may have used fire as a tool to shape the localized landscape surrounding the site.

Though formal long-distance exchange networks have been documented in prehistoric Eastern North America, not all exchange necessarily occurred in this manner. In fact, informal, casual, personto-person exchange through mechanisms such as gifting, may have been equally important in transporting objects over long distances. Specifically, the small number of obsidian artifacts recovered from sites in the Middle Atlantic region documents long-distance exchange. Obsidian, as a chemically traceable and exotic material, provides evidence for informal and more casual exchange in Eastern North America. Such informal exchange may have cemented relationships between individuals and offered a social link to far away lands.

One of the most important sites, Batacosa (SON:S:7:2) is currently the focus of our research including surveys and extensive excavations at the site. Batacosa is located in the municipality of Quiriego in the ancient limits between Yaquis and Mayos indigenous groups in southern Sonora. Preliminary results show that the site was of regional importance because its dimensions, the density of archaeological features, and the presence of local and foreign artifacts. .

for archaeological reconnaissance in densely forested areas. It will focus on the latest generation of both airborne and terrestrial laser scanners, which use the entire waveform of the received laser echoes to distinguish between vegetation and solid structures. These systems have the potential to provide a more accurate DTM as well as better and more detailed information on e.g. buildings within densely vegetated areas. Using several case studies, the paper will present the implications of this new generation of laser scanners for the documentation of cultural heritage. Dong, Guanghui [177] see Elston, Robert G.

However, how, when and to what extent agriculture declined is not well understood in this region. Zongri is a newly defined culture distributed to the south of Qinghai Lake, contemporary with the Majiayao culture to the east. Stable isotope analysis of human remains from Zongri site shows slightly increasing millet and less animal protein consumption through time, suggesting a growing emphasis on agriculture. These data are compared to other contemporary sites with isotopic and/or paleoethnobotanical evidence for agricultural diets during this era. Donner, Natalia (UNAM) and Jonathan Hernández Arana [254] Lithic Technologies at El Carrizal, Veracruz: An Operational Sequence Study El Carrizal, Veracruz is an archaeological site from the Proto-Classic period (100 B.C. ­ 100 A.D.) located in South-Central Veracruz. Recent intensive survey of 13 square kilometers in the immediate vicinity of this area by the Proyecto Arquelógico El Carrizal identified numerous lithic artifacts produced from various raw materials (basalt, flint, obsidian, travertine, etc). The study of these lithic artifacts, based on the Operational Sequence Methodology, covers different stages in their use-life, from procurement to abandonment. This approach will provide new perspectives on the role, use and technologies of lithic artifacts from Terminal Formative through Early Classic Period in South-Central Veracruz.

Doolittle, William (University of Texas) [44] A View from the Other Side of the Fence In 1990 and again in 1993 I hypothesized that irrigation originated in the southern Southwest and spread into Mexico. I also outlined a sequence of technological developments in Mesoamerican irrigation. My first hypothesis was proven correct by work at the Las Capas site. Subsequent work in Mexico proved my other ideas to be less accurate. This presentation brings irrigation research in the Southwest and Mexico up-to-date in a pan-regional context. Doran, Glen H.

Dorshow, Wetherbee (University of New Mexico) [131] GIS-based Landscape Reconstruction of the Chaco Core During the Bonito Phase This paper presents a GIS-based reconstruction of the 11th century landscape in the Chaco Core. The geospatial reconstruction is based on the Archaeoflow GIS framework and draws on stratigraphic interpretations of archaeological trenches in the Pueblo Bonito mounds as well as previous geomorphic and archaeological research in the region. The ArchaeoFlow framework is a geospatial data model and analytical structure for reconstructing past landforms and environments and simulating hydrological processes. Dortch, Joe (University of Western Australia) [16] Late Pleistocene Environmental Change and the Evidence for an Economic Response in south-western Australia Southwestern Australia, a Mediterranean-type region, features flat topography, nutrient-depleted soils, and a diverse and resilient biota relatively unaffected by climatic oscillations. Zoo-archaeological evidence and hunter-gatherer occupational remains dating from c.45,000 BP at limestone caves in the far south-west indicate changes in prey abundances c.10,000 BP, contemporaneous with small shifts in plant associations as documented by pollen and charcoal sequences. Such localized change need have required no major regional-scale innovations. While much work remains to be done in the little-investigated, drier interior, and in assessing social changes, the picture so far suggests shifts in emphasis rather than fundamental economic change. Douglas, Joseph [62] see Blankenship, Sarah A. Douglass, John (Statistical Research, Inc.) and Seetha Reddy (Statistical Research, Inc.) [154] Perceiving Food and Identity during Culture Contact Culture change and continuity are two fundamental aspects of archaeological research. In this talk we discuss culture change and continuity as perceived through food during the contact period in North America - a time of upheaval and change for Native Americans. Contact with European and Hispanic cultures, either through the Mission system and/or through colonization, introduced new ideologies, technologies, and social structures. However, Native American exposure to and incorporation of these new traditions was varied. Our talk focuses on markers of cultural identities among hunter gatherers, and the most prevalent media for expression of cultural identity among hunter-gatherers.

Here we report on the use of digital imaging analysis as an alternate measure of artifact movement. Artifacts were photographed under controlled lighting and analyzed using imaging software. The extracted data create a distribution of assemblage color variation. Isolated data points represent unpaired artifacts within assemblages thus indicating transport from elsewhere. Conversely, point clusters provide a basis for linking artifacts to the same nodule. Results demonstrate the usefulness of color variation for investigating artifact movement within high volume assemblages produced from local materials. Dowd, Elsbeth (University of Oklahoma) [26] The Woods Mound Group: Revisiting a Multi-mound Site in the Caddo Area The Woods Mound Group (34MC104) is a late prehistoric site along the Mountain Fork River in southeastern Oklahoma, in the Caddo archaeological area. A portion was excavated in 1964-65 prior to inundation by the Broken Bow Reservoir. The site, which is situated

within the Ouachita Mountains, includes eight low mounds (0.2-0.8 m tall) clustered into two distinct groups. By obtaining four new radiocarbon dates and stylistically reanalyzing the pottery from these two groups, this project attempts to test whether the mounds were built concurrently and whether socially different groups of people were responsible for their construction. Doyon, Leon (HRAF, Inc.) [67] Once in a Lifetime?: Spondylus Supply and Demand in the Regional Developmental Period Ecuadorian Highlands A sequence of shaft tombs at La Florida, Quito attributable to a generation or three of a middle Regional Developmental period (ca. AD 150-500) elite lineage provides a unique look at the short-term microeconomics of a system of long-distance exchange emphasizing Spondylus. Although social reproduction was highly dependent upon prodigious amounts of Spondylus ultimately consumed in mortuary ritual, supply was spotty and processing probably was local and small-scale. In order to maintain exclusivity, the ruling class was forced to practice strategies of rationing and substitution and, quite likely, personally undertake perilous journeys to the ends of the earth. Drake, Douglas (Washington State University) and John G. Jones (Washington State University) [136] Spatial Analysis of Phytoliths from an Archaic Shell Midden in Coastal Chiapas A detailed analysis of phytoliths from a shell midden in southern Chiapas is revealing information on prehistoric plant use and human activity. Samples collected in 1m increments across a gridded pattern on a prepared clay floor reveal distribution patterns reflecting past plant use. Possible presence of economic types including palms and Heliconia, presumably thatch, should prove to be particularly significant. These patterns have the potential to document the presence of houses or other ephemeral structures. Other phytolith types document nearby forests and potentially significant plant foods. The role of cultigens at this 5500 year old site is also explored. Drake, Eric (Binghamton University/Hiawatha National Forest) and John Franzen (Hiawatha National Forest) [114] Commodity Fetishism and the Looter`s Looter: Casting a Reflexive Gaze Upon the Practice of Archaeology In Capitalism For professional archaeologists, relic hunting, or looting, represents the quintessential antithesis of the discipline; and yet, this wide spread activity has received little analytical attention. In this paper we draw upon examples of recent looting activity in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to explore relic hunting as a social practice structured by the commodity form of historical narrative production. This exercise serves as an entry point for asking the difficult question: "In what way(s) does the practice of archaeology in the context of late capitalism resemble that of looting, and how might this affect our collaborative relationships with descendant communities?" Drass, Richard, Stephen Perkins (Oklahoma State University) and Susan Vehik (University of Oklahoma) [171] Digging Ditches; Fortifications at Bryson-Paddock and Other Southern Plains Villages In 1759, Spanish forces attacked a Wichita village on the Red River. The expedition provided the first description of a Wichita fortification; a roughly circular rampart and stockade surrounded by a ditch. Wichita groups erected similar structures as early as 1500. Magnetometer surveys and excavations at an 18th century Wichita village revealed three concentric ditches representing portions of fortifications. The efforts expended to excavate ditches and build extensive fortifications at large villages reflect intensification of intertribal conflict in the southern Plains by 1700, probably arising from increased mobility with arrival of horses and competition over access to the European market economy. Drennan, Robert D. [155] see Peterson, Christian E. Dretske, Lisa (Illinois State University) [125] German Ethnicity in Missouri

This paper will examine the ways in which German immigrants expressed their ethnic identity in a town dominated by French colonial descendants. The analysis is based on material culture recovered from excavations at the Janis-Ziegler/Green Tree Tavern site (23G272) in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, and historical documentation, including census records, probate records, and newspapers from several archives. Drew, Brooke (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) [124] "Register of Burials at Milwaukee County Poor Farm": Utilizing Historical Documentation in the Analysis of an Excavated Historic Cemetery The analysis of the Milwaukee County Poor Farm Cemetery is an example of the utility of the use of multiple lines of evidence including that of anthropologically-oriented archaeology and historical documentation. Documentation includes a ledger-format book, though incomplete, which includes name, residence, place, cause, and date of death, burial date and grave number. This information, as well as the county death certificates, is currently being inputted into a database to facilitate management and statistical manipulation. This poster demonstrates how this will inform the osteological analysis of the remains and make possible the identification of individuals interned at the cemetery. Drew, Natalie (US Army Corps of Engineers) [76] Meeting the Curation Challenges of the Digital Dark Age Curating archaeological associated documentation has always been challenging but the increasing usage of digital and electronic media in these collections has made it especially so. These challenges can be so daunting that the threat of a Digital Dark Age, where electronically recorded information is inaccessible and the information is irrevocably lost, seems a very real possibility. This paper will discuss some of these challenges (particularly those associated with digital images), identify different types of electronic records, and provide practical strategies for curating electronic and digital records. [76] First Chair [76] Second Organizer Driver, W. (Houston Community College) [112] Building Boundaries: Ancient Maya Architectural Design and the Construction of Social Identity Excavations at the site of Blue Creek in Northwestern Belize documented a wide range of formal variation in the architectural designs of both ritual and residential structures. Further study determined that a consistent set of proportions were present in the design elements that comprise the substructural façades of temples and shrines located within the site core area. Comparisons with formal shrine groups located in the surrounding settlement zone indicate a correlation between shrine façade design and settlement distribution, and provide potential insight into the sociopolitical organization of the polity.

This method is particularly relevant for the study of use-wear features on ground stone tools made of coarse, non-homogeneous, raw material. In this paper, we explore another promising approach: the high magnification (from x50 to 500) analysis of ground stone tools using a metallographic microscope. We discuss the methods used to observe and photograph the surfaces and comment on some of the use-wear features observed in an

DuChemin, Geoffrey (University of Florida) [116] Food and Community: Zooarchaeology in South Central Puerto Rico Recent research from sites in south-central Puerto Rico provides an opportunity to shed new light on the nature of pre-Columbian social organization in the region. Animal remains recovered from three sites, PO-29 (Jacanas), PO-42, and PO-43, are currently being analyzed. Preliminary results are presented here, emphasizing how faunal data can be used to elucidate aspects of social development and organization. Food procurement, allocation, and consumption are communal activities that hold important cultural significance. Careful zooarchaeological analysis offers interpretation of social organization that focuses on the level of the community, as opposed to centralpower models that are often applied when chiefly societies are presupposed. Dudgeon, John (Idaho State University - CAMAS), David Peterson (Idaho State University) and Monica Tromp (Idaho State University) [175] Traces of the Trade: Bronze Age Metal Producers in the Eurasian Steppes Determined Through Skeletal Trace Metals Human skeletal and wild and domesticated faunal remains from the Middle Bronze Age II Kamennyi-Ambar V cemetery (western Siberia, circa 2025-1745 BC) were analyzed for trace metals to determine the probability of identifying copper and bronze producers in ancient populations. Current social models favor sedentary agriculturalists over Eurasian steppe pastoralists, while metallurgy was another significant productive activity during this period. Identifying metal producers is crucial to improving present understandings of ancient Eurasian societies. Signatures of metal production in human bone acquired by LA-ICP-MS and SEM-EDS are compared with results for local fauna to distinguish and quantify non-occupational uptake and diagenesis.

These structures, one of which was likely built to replace the other after it burned, were ritual buildings located in the center of the site: analyses identified a variety of features that distinguish them from domestic contexts, including evidence for ritual animal sacrifice, special architectural construction methods, and communal storage activities. Building from the characteristics of the burned structures, this paper will explore why and by whom these were targeted for burning, as well as the implications for social and political developments in the community and region. Duff, Andrew (Washington State University) [240] Producing Structure: The Role of Ceramic Production in Understanding Chaco-period Communities in the American Southwest Pottery production within a community comprised of kin, neighbors, and more distant others is a conscious act that reproduces societal relationships in material culture. Information encoded into vessels during manufacture is used to reveal differences in learning frameworks among the residents of two Chaco-period communities (ca. A.D. 1050-1130) located at the intersection of two classic Southwestern Culture Areas--Mogollon and Pueblo. Aspects of undecorated vessel manufacture both document and served to reproduce difference, while larger scales of social action signal greater communal unity; both processes are argued to be accurate reflections and embodiments of social relations.

Duffy, Paul (University of Michigan) [149] Trends and locations for Bronze Age crafting in the Lower Körös Basin The fortified tell sites of the Great Hungarian Plain are believed by most specialists to be the area`s centers of craft production and consumption. This paper evaluates the evidence for this claim in the Lower Körös Basin. First, I estimate metal consumption by site for the regional scale. Second, using surface collection material from open and tell settlements for a focus area within the Basin, I consider the evidence for stone tool production and metallurgy over the Early and Middle Bronze Age. The observed patterns at both scales suggest that fortified tells have less authority over craft production than previously believed. Dunand, David [140] see Chastain, Matthew L.

In this paper, I will present the phytolith results from the same squash and gourd artifacts. As part of a larger dataset, starch and phytolith residues provided evidence of taxa not identified in the macroremains, despite excellent preservation. The results of this study have implications for interpreting agriculture in Late Preceramic Peru, as well as feasting and ritual behaviors associated with food.

Dunford, Ashley (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) [124] Examples of Juvenile Scurvy from the Milwaukee County Poor Farm Ortner (2001) and Brickley and Ives (2006) have thoroughly researched and recorded methods of diagnosing scurvy in juvenile skeletal remains in the recent years. This poster details examples of scurvy in juvenile remains from the Milwaukee Poor Farm Cemetery. This research is focused on two temporally distinct areas of the cemetery both used for the exclusive burial of children. These distinct areas of sampled in order to determine the presence of scurvy.

Dungan, Katherine (University of Arizona) [235] Distance and Perception in GIS Visibility Analysis: A Chacoan Example Models of changes in the visibility of objects with increasing distance are crucial to GIS viewshed analysis if our visibility models are to accurately represent human experience. This study uses an approach to visibility derived from the fields of proxemics, architecture, and landscape design to examine intervisibility within the community surrounding the Chacoan great house of Kin Bineola, New Mexico. The distance classification model, in combination with ground truthing of lines of sight, provides a robust model of intracommunity visibility that can then be used to question the apparently straightforward relationship between visibility and monumental, ritual, or community architecture.

Dunn, Stacy (Tulane University) and Kit Nelson (Tulane University) [137] Reevaluating Ceramic Chronologies for the Huaura Valley, North-Central Coast of Peru This study examines both inter- and intra-site variability of Chancay ceramic assemblages during the Late Intermediate Period (A.D. 1100-1435) and Late Horizon (A.D. 1435-1532) in the Huaura Valley, north-central coast of Peru. Unfortunately, Chancay pottery typologies established in the 1920s have not advanced since then beyond basic descriptions of stylistic traits. To address this issue, detailed attribute analysis of pottery excavated from structures at three sites--Rontoy, Chambara, and Quipico--combined with AMS dates allow for the formation of a more refined ceramic chronology. Pottery distributions across time and space are then compared to characterize the Chancay in this region. Dunn, Stacy [98] see Heaton, Ashley K.

An experimental adaptable cell laser ablation system was recently developed for the characterization of archaeological specimens without the necessity to destructively subsample whole artifacts that will not fit in a standard laser chamber. The acquisition of such a laser system reduces the risk of biased samples that a selection of only small or already broken objects could introduce. A

Duwe, Sam (University of Arizona) [19] Coalescence, Continuity, and Change in the Tewa Basin, New Mexico The large Classic Period (AD 1325-1600) sites in the Tewa Basin of northern New Mexico have confused archaeologists interested in population movement over the past century with their sprawling architecture and long ceramic chronological sequences (in some cases over three centuries). This paper will address the results of a ceramic analysis from surface contexts of 10 sites in the region. By comparing ceramic seriations to detailed site maps it is possible to create a high resolution culture history of population coalescence. This research is imperative to conduct studies of cosmological and ecological adaptation during this period of social and residential upheaval. Dwyer, Benjamin [22] see Johnson, Angela K.

The social role of design structure within a mortuary system has not been explored, yet it is a rich resource. The goal of this paper is to systematically examine ceramic design structure against the spatial order of burials as a comparison of mortuary data sets in the burial program of the Late Intermediate Period Chiribaya in Peru.

specialization and trade in the Carpathian Basin during the Middle Bronze Age. There in the Benta Valley, control over particular products, such as animals, appears to be increasingly centralized to central settlements, while other specialization, such as in ceramics, was not centralized; ceramic production and exchange involved numerous, local producers. Why this happened will be analyzed, as well as how control over exchange, rather than over production, apparently drove a restructuring of the political economy and an increase in social stratification.

While variously interpreted as sky bands, terrestrial bands, or schematized monster maws, the bands share a vocabulary of forms and structuring principles. We explore how these forms and structuring devices relate to textile and costuming traditions, and consider the conceptual overlap between these mechanisms for delineating space, wrapping scenes, objects, or persons, and literally framing narratives or imagery. These framing bands also extended into the architectural domain, evidencing the fluidity of this motif as a communicative device that may have carried locative associations.

To develop culturally relevant pedagogy and understand the impact and value of knowledge about history and cultural heritage, it is important to explore ideas students already have about these concepts and how students interpret and transform information they gather. In North-Central Belize, through contact with archaeological resources, research projects, and curriculum initiatives, students develop ideas about and interests in "the Olden Days," archaeology, and "the Mayas."

Ebeling, Jennie (University of Evansville) [216] The More They Stay the Same: Use of the Bible and Palestinian Ethnography in the Study of Ground Stone Tool Use in the Bronze and Iron Age Southern Levant This presentation will begin with an overview of the use of the Hebrew Bible and nineteenth and twentieth century Palestinian ethnography by archaeologists to illustrate ground stone tool use in the Bronze and Iron Ages. Due to changes in grinding technology, recent ethnography does not necessarily inform our understanding of the archaeological material; likewise, the biases of the biblical writers make the texts unreliable for reconstructing ground stone tool use in

the past. I will demonstrate how use-wear analyses can be used to reconstruct function, and suggest reasons why archaeologists essentially overlook the artifacts when discussing food preparation activities.

Potters in these villages produced basalt tempered pottery that has been recovered throughout the Rio Grande region. Due to the lack of successful petrographic provenance studies, archaeologists have been unable to pinpoint production of this pottery to a specific village or group of villages. A pilot study applying LA-ICP-MS to pastes and basalt tempers from Rio Abajo pottery was done to see if this technique can be used to determine production provenance in this region of the American Southwest. Edmonds, Jason (Mississippi State University) [236] Mobility and Population Change in Northeast Mississippi: An Object-Based Seriation of Projectile Points as a Relative Paleodemographic Indicator Considerations of mobility have primarily focused on the differences in and among the kinds of mobility, rather than addressing why settlement patterns were mobile. This study addresses such questions within evolutionary theory. Using the concept of bethedging/waste, it is argued that mobility was selected for its population limiting properties. Relative changes in the numbers of projectile points in seriated classes were taken to indicate relative population change. The result suggests that rapid growth occurred only with the abandonment of mobility in the Gulf Formational period and indicates that in this instance mobility was a bet-hedging behavior. Edwards, Matt (University of California, Santa Barbara) [127] Building a Landscape of Power: Middle Horizon Infrastructure of The Upper Nasca Valley During a period of rapid territorial expansion that began around AD 750, the Wari empire engaged in extensive construction of administrative and economic infrastructure throughout the Peruvian Andes. While these administrative centers, roads, and agricultural improvements surely served specific functions; when taken together they also would have formed an imposing political landscape upon which the power of the state to shape the world would have been clearly manifest.

the Schmeling site (47JE833), The Twin Knolls site (47JE379), and Carcajou Point site (47JE814). Each of these sites contains an Oneota occupation dating to circa A.D. 1200-1400. The GIS is used to illustrate the environmental variables that were most important in determining settlement locations for the Oneota inhabitants of the region. To accomplish this goal, data on Oneota resource exploitation is combined with a model of prehistoric environmental conditions of 13th Century Lake Koshkonong. The model is based on examination of the General Land Office Survey notes and maps as well as study of the soils surrounding the four sites.

Ferguson (Desert Reserch Institute) [211] The Density Dilemma: The Challenge of Defining, Interpreting, and Managing Diffuse Lithic Scatters in the southern Great Basin Archaeologists still struggle with how best to define and interpret diffuse lithic scatters within local and regional contexts, while government agencies have been charged with managing these important low-density resources. Typically, diffuse scatters are treated as discrete sites with boundaries determined by changes in artifact density. This approach focuses on higher-density concentrations within a continuous distribution while masking the nature of the intervening landscape. Searching for better balance between research goals and management needs, we examine a siteless survey approach and the utility of the archaeological district to investigate diffuse lithic scatters in three geologically distinct areas of southeastern Nevada.

Traditionally, this shift has been attributed to an ill-defined climatic shift that is used to explain an observed reduction in the number of known sites and the transition to mobile pastoralism. Both phenomena are possible responses to climatic shifts, however the two prevalent theories explaining these changes rely upon opposing climatic scenarios, underscoring the problem of simplistic climatic models. This paper explores these changes from a landscape perspective, attempting to break the circular arguments of previous approaches.

Within the past 15 years, our understanding of the cultural landscape of the late prehistoric period in northern Wisconsin and surrounding areas reflects greater cultural diversity than was formerly recognized and a greater dependence on horticulture than was thought to exist in the "northwoods."

Panels on sandstone cliffs at a ranch near Post, Texas display influences of at least two native populations present on the Southern High Plains. Variations in the style of structures, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures, and differences in the display of interaction between elements, indicate the influence of Southwestern and Plains peoples in the area. Specific elements that demonstrate different authorship include structures, a possible threetoed turtle, possible representations of agriculture, and people. Superimpositions show temporal differences, indicating that different groups influenced or were responsible for the creation of these petroglyphs. Ehrhardt, Kathleen (Illinois State Museum) [102] The Protohistoric Copper-base Metal Industry from New Lenox Over 170 pieces of copper base metal have been recovered from securely dated early protohistoric contexts at the New Lenox site. Formal, technological, compositional, and comparative analyses reveal that at least some of artifacts in the industry occur both in earlier late prehistoric and in later protohistoric assemblages documented elsewhere in the region. Native and European-derived copper-base metals are used to manufacture New Lenox artifacts, and the technological means through which the metals are manipulated appear to remain consistent throughout these critical periods.

These data reflect a shift from regional, inland-focused interaction spheres to larger-scale, international linkages via coastal trade routes by the end of the Late Classic Period. This is most clearly indicated by participation in the Canbalam ceramic sphere, which encompassed coastal trade centers between Yucatan to Tabasco. These changes were part of a general pattern of increasing pan-Mesoamerican cultural linkages that characterized the Terminal Classic/Epiclassic period.

During construction, a late prehistoric semi-subterranean housepit was identified before it was bulldozed into the ocean with most of the associated artifacts. In 2006, another housepit and a midden were uncovered and subsequently excavated. This well-preserved Late Western Thule site was salvaged through the combined efforts of the Army Corps, volunteers from the Nome Eskimo Community and the City of Nome.

Young Adult Perspectives on Irish Archaeology This case study of 18-26 year olds in Dublin uses a combination of interviews and surveys to answer the question: Does archaeology matter to Ireland`s young adults? By targeting three key areas: 1. Interest, Knowledge, and Participation, 2. Archaeology and Identity, and 3. Archaeology and Society, archaeologists can understand the role archaeology plays in young adults` lives and make informed decisions for the future of archaeology. By synthesizing these findings with previous research in North America and Europe, we can begin to identify the global trends and social phenomena that impact public perceptions of archaeology and consequently, archaeology itself.

Examining these effects requires precise temporal control over environmental and cultural events, which is currently lacking. Moreover, in some areas, such as the eastern Great Lakes, observed changes may correlate with factors not related in a direct manner to the Younger Dryas event like forest succession. Nonetheless, in more northern areas of the western Great Lakes region there are some suggestions that after initial penetration by Clovis-like groups use of these areas was minimized, perhaps in response to the Younger Dryas.

Partial and complete structure burning has long been known from this area, with little consensus among archaeologists as to its nature. Suggested causes include ritual-, accidental-, and conflict-related events. Data on structure burning from 400 pithouses throughout the Hohokam area indicate that this practice was not homogeneous, but locally specific, suggesting the possibility of intraregional differences in ritual. This study supports previous research suggesting a high degree of behavioral diversity within the Hohokam area.

Contradictory mono-ethnic versus multi-ethnic interpretations of Cahokian identity have emerged in the literature. We suggest that a multi-ethnic model better fits known regional evidence, especially given the shortcomings of past trade models. We review the redundant signatures of extra-regional connections, most notably with the Trans-Mississippi South, and the hints of relocated non-local contingents at Cahokia. We also review Skiri Pawnee ceremonialism and the implications of Caddoan-like fineware pottery in the region, leading us to call for more sophisticated models of Cahokian identities and descendants.

In the northern steppe frontier, nomadic pastoral cultures arose and one of the strongest confederacies to emerge were the Xiongnu, who posed a threat to Chinese states. Bioarchaeological analysis of arthritic patterns in skeletal collections from sites in China and Mongolia dating to this turbulent time offer insight into the toll of changing subsistence strategies and increased warfare.

the period traditionally considered the "Classic Maya Collapse." The end of the 8th century sees dramatic changes in political and social structure at this lowland center and holds a unique perspective on the events. Dating and tracking which events took place in which order requires a tight chronological control with especial attention paid to the subtle changes in ceramic slip, paste, and shape found in the site's indigenous potting tradition. These subtle changes are explored here and the results may serve as a metric for other sites in the Peten, regardless of their own events in and around the end of the Classic period.

Erickson, Clark (University of Pennsylvania) [222] Historical Ecology of Totora Reeds in Lake Titicaca Andean peoples are often portrayed by archaeologists as powerless in the face of climatic fluctuation or degraders of their environment. In contrast, historical ecologists and landscape archaeologists show that they created and managed landscapes effectively. Although misinterpreted as wild, the natives have been cultivating and managing totora reeds for millennia. Totora is used for roofing, boats, mats, basketry, floating settlements, and food, and thus, critical for dense populations in the development of complex societies in the Lake Titicaca basin. I compare the demand for totora to the distribution, reproduction, growth rates under human management to evaluate sustainability and environmental impact.

Pike/Baehr and White Hall/Weaver are the predominate types represented. However, almost no Havana ceramics or transitional Havana-Pike to White Hall ceramics were identified.

Despite severe climatic conditions, however, it seems that the process of colonization continued and several scholars have argued that even the, now submerged, North Sea continent (Doggerland) was settled by the Ahrensburgian hunters. The present paper will review recent Scandinavian research dealing with the timing and nature of the colonization process in relation to the younger dryas environmental preconditions.

We will discuss aspects of the design and collaboration to complete a large multi-disciplinary project. The Tutu project, a landmark project in Caribbean Archaeology, will be used to demonstrate the integration of work from specialists in physics, geology, chemistry, archaeology and others to studying the Tutu Village Site occupation and reconstructing social organization, diet, technology, and various other important aspects of life on PreColumbian St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands Fash, Barbara (Harvard University) [153] Enclosed Courtyards as Watery Realms in Maya and South East Asian Environments Although the reservoir systems in SE Asia and the Maya area were the primary urban water retention features, smaller enclosed courtyards that collected and channeled water into the reservoirs allowed for retention on a personal scale. Symbolism often associated with courtyards indicates their importance in architectural layouts and their associations with water and fertility. Comparing from both tropical culture areas, this paper will explore the role the enclosed courtyard played in past social organization and water management, and how their water features can impact sanitation and sustainability issues. Fast, Natalie (BLM- Canyons of the Ancients National Monument) [75] Canyons of the Ancients National Monument Cultural Landscapes Established as a National Monument by President Clinton in June 2000, Canyons of the Ancients contains 164,000 acres administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Since 2000, several large block intensive cultural resource inventories have been conducted. These inventories covered 13,500 acres and recorded 1,192 sites. Almost 26% of the Monument has now been inventoried, an unprecedented coverage for a BLM area, and approximately 6,350 sites total are documented. This poster presentation will provide a synthesis of inventory results and new information on Ancestral Puebloan settlement and land use in the Monument. Fatkin, Danielle (Knox College), Andrew Wilson (University of Liverpool), Benjamin Porter (University of California, Berkeley), Bruce Routledge (University of Liverpool) and Katherine Adelsberger (Knox College) [92] In Search of Empire: On-Site Survey at Dhiban (Jordan) Researchers excavating multi-period sites have the challenge of how best to understand their site's long-term habitation history without excavating the entire settlement. Dhiban, Jordan, poses similar issues for its excavators. Although archaeologists have worked here for many years, periods of the site's history remain obscure. The current investigation of Dhiban's habitation history is necessary to distinguish between true indications of settlement expansion and abatement and apparent abatement due to lack of data. By combining GIS, surface collection, and test pits with old excavation data, the survey team was able to identify and investigate changes in settlement size.

Much has been made of the role Tlaxcala played in the Spanish Conquest of Mexico. Our understanding of Postclassic period Aztec Realpolitik comes predominantly from a Mexica worldview. What we know about Tlaxcala settlement and political orientation in earlier periods is based on Garcia Cook or Snow`s work from the late 1960`s and 1970`s. The role of Cholula or Teotihuacan in earlier time periods is alternately viewed as huge or marginal. The multi-component site of Calcahuas, located close to the present-day city of Tlaxcala in the municipio of Totolac provides a small scale perspective on these issues. Faust, Katherine (UC Riverside) [260] Skin Deep: A Comparison of Formative Period Olmec and Postclassic Huastec Body Iconography The Formative period Olmec and Postclassic Huastec cultures of the Gulf Coast Region developed two of the major Mesoamerican iconographic traditions. Separated by time and space, both cultures depicted human bodies "tattooed" with abstract symbols in a unique manner when compared with the material productions of other Mesoamerican cultures. Thus, although the Las Limas statuette and the sculpture known as the Huastec Youth belie distinct aesthetic and ideological systems, they share important stylistic and conceptual features. This paper explores the style and meanings of these bodily inscriptions and considers the possibility of recognizing echoes of Formative period Olmec iconographic style in Postclassic Huastec art. Fauvelle, Mikael (California State University, Northridge) [134] Feasting and Social Complexity at La Blanca, Guatemala Feasts provide venues through which individuals and groups can publicly compete for wealth and prestige. As such, competitive feasting provides an attractive model for studying the emergence and development of social complexity. This paper presents data on the distribution, size and form of ceramic feasting vessels at the Middle Formative site of La Blanca, Guatemala. Comparisons between house mounds allow for the examination of differences between elite and non-elite consumption and of the role of feasting as a means of elite aggrandizement. Results are contextualized with regard to the regional development of social complexity during the Formative Period. Faux, Jennifer (SUNY Buffalo) [169] Mapping the Past: An Assessment of the Half-Conical Figurine Workshops at Teotihuacan The figurine assemblages of Teotihuacan have been intensively studied by archaeologists in the past, yet little is known regarding the Half-Conical figurines; specifically the location of the figurine`s workshops. This paper will address the distribution of the Half-Conical figurine assemblages at Teotihuacan in hopes of determining the specific location of Half-Conical workshops at Teotihuacan. Based on the results of the maps the possible location of Half-Conical workshops was evaluated. Fay, Amelia (Memorial University of Newfoundland) [27] Mikak`s House: Excavations of a Late Eighteenth Century Inuit Settlement In 1767, Mikak was one of nine Inuit captured by British sailors off the coast of Labrador, Canada, and later taken to London, England. Mikak helped secure the Moravian missionaries` proposed land grant, enabling them to establish their first mission station in Nain in 1771. Mikak lived at Khernertok, a sod house settlement on Black Island, Labrador in 1776. Excavations at Khernertok will foster our knowledge of the changing late eighteenth century Inuit economy. The Inuit and their lifeways were not entirely superseded by Europeans; they were active agents in the changing social and

Patrick (University at Buffalo) [243] Reassessing the 'Proper Study' of Medieval Archaeology: Twenty Years Later Over the past several decades, medieval archaeology (AD 500-1500) has become one of the fastest growing subfields in our discipline, thanks to an increase in urban rescue projects as well as continued interest in identifying the sociopolitical origins of "Europe". More importantly, medieval archaeologists are developing increasingly sophisticated research agendas that transcend just "proving" or "disproving" traditional historical narratives. However, with few exceptions, medieval archaeology remains largely outside broader theoretical and methodological debates within mainstream Anglophone archaeology. This presentation examines some underlying reasons for this unfortunate lack of dialogue, and calls for more concerted attempts to bridge this disciplinary gap. [243] First Organizer ;[243] First Chair Feathers, James (University of Washington) [72] Dating Buried Soils Below Rock Structures Stone circles ("tipi rings") and other rock alignments are common archaeological features in the northern High Plains and adjacent Rocky Mountains. Although important for understanding huntergatherer adaptations and settlement in this region, most of these features have not been dated. This poster presents the application of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) of sediments underneath the rocks in order to date when the rocks were placed. Results from rock structures from the Absaraka Mountains of northeastern Wyoming and from the Kutoyis bison jump site in north central Montana show that reasonable dates can be obtained.

Although environmental changes were substantial during the Younger Dryas, we have identified three bear hunting sites dating to this time. Elsewhere on the Northwest Coast a small number of sites contain components of this age. Together these sites provide a small window on early human occupation despite most Younger Dryas era shorelines having been drowned to at least 75 m below modern levels.

Chesley (University of Arizona) [255] Transmissions and Transformations in Protohistoric Baja California: Copper-Based Metals from Laguna Guerrero Negro An assortment of Colonial Period objects were recovered through survey and excavation at protohistoric Cochimi residential sites along Laguna Guerrero Negro (LGN), central Baja California, Mexico. A sample of copper-based objects recovered from residential loci in the LGN region was subjected to compositional and isotopic analyses with the purpose of exploring provenance for the materials. Furthermore, metallographic analyses also were employed to examine modifications and adaptations of materials by indigenes for local usage. Preliminary evidence suggests that LGN brasses were imported, from Europe or possibly East Asia, while unalloyed copper objects originated from other locations, potentially mainland Mexico.

Fennell, Christopher (University of Illinois) [125] Multivalent Histories and Archaeology of a Diverse Frontier Town Several universities, a state museum, and local and descendant communities are collaborating in exploring the histories of a town established in 1836 on the American frontier. New Philadelphia, Illinois was founded by a free African American, and it grew over several decades of existence into an integrated town with residents of African American, European American, Canadian, Irish, and English heritage, among others. This project addresses the challenges and rewards of analyzing past multiethnic and interracial social relationships through interdisciplinary methods, and of serving the interests of diverse groups presently focused on enhancing the national memory and heritage of this town. Fenner, Lindsay (University of Nevada Reno) and Chrissina Burke (University of Nevada Reno) [232] What pluvial beach ridges say about prehistory: New investigations along Pleistocene Mud Lake, Nye County, Nevada Investigations at Pleistocene lakes throughout the twentieth century provided a great deal of knowledge concerning the prehistoric peoples of the Great Basin. Continuing this tradition is the most recent work conducted at pluvial Mud Lake, Nye County, Nevada. This project, focusing on beach ridges, geologically active areas, and previously known sites, aims to provide more information concerning the chronology, subsistence, and mobility of the prehistoric inhabitants of this area. With temporal diagnostics of Paleoindian age through the present, Mud Lake continues to be a unique investigation into prehistory. Fenner, Sr., Dale [234] see Zedeno, Maria N.

Similar ceramics are found in very limited quantities on El Paso Phase sites in south central New Mexico. Recent compositional analysis of carbon-painted ceramics from the Pinnacle, Gallinas Springs and Roadmap sites has identified characteristic chemical signatures that suggest local production. These data are compared with a limited sample of carbon-painted sherds from an El Paso phase site in the Tularosa Basin.

(University of Arizona) and Barbara J. Mills [14] Reuniting Southwestern Ethnography with Archaeology A Southwestern ethnologist recently told us that most of the interesting research in Southwestern ethnography was now being done by archaeologists. This situation has resulted from a number of factors including fewer sociocultural anthropologists working in the Southwest, increasing numbers of archaeologists responding to the demands of heritage management, the desire of tribes to become active partners in research, and renewed theoretical perspectives that require linkages between the past and the present. In this paper we evaluate how and why this situation has come about and what this might mean for the future of Southwestern archaeology.

Fernandez, Gerardo (Universidad Autonoma de Zacatecas) [23] La Arrqueometria en el Contexto de la Educacion Superior A raíz del desarrollo constante de nuevas técnicas en arqueometría, se discuten los enfoques que pueden utilizarse para incluir este corpus de conocimientos científicos en los programas formativos para arqueólogos. Las alternativas se desglosan en dos vertientes: Incluir materias técnicas en los programas correspondientes (lo que involucra una decisión sobre qué especialidades deben ser incluidas en una propuesta curricular limitada), o bien, se puede optar por la interdisciplina incluyendo especialistas de diversas áreas en la formación de estudiantes. Cualquiera sea la ruta que se tome, la inclusión de la arqueometría en los programas formativos debe considerar limitaciones institucionales, el tipo de profesionista que se está formando y el mercado laboral disponible. Fernandez, Patricia [191] Costa Rica Metallurgy: Local Productions and Social Networks Established with CR, Panamá and Nicaragua This paper presents the results of a study in which has been possible to characterize the pre-hispanic metallurgical production in Costa Rica in terms of the provenance ore sources, technology and contextual variables. The analytical study on pre-hispanic metal artifacts and ore sources from Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panamá use diverse techniques, such XRF and EDS through is possible to identify social networks between Panamá, Costa Rica and Nicaragua. This study pretends to contribute to the discussion about regional interaction related about production and circulation of metallic objects. Fernández León, Elisa [191] see Aguilar, Ana Cristina Fernstrom, Katharine (Towson University) [247] Archaeology and the Construction of Euro-American Identity: Tiffany & Co. at the 1893 Chicago Exposition The surveys and excavations of Squier and Davis, in the midwestern US, form one cornerstone of 19th century scientific knowledge and debates about pre-European America. These arguments and debates were not limited to scholarly texts, but were also incorporated into popular culture, and into decorative arts created for public display at the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition, and for private display in the home. For example, Tiffany & Co. produced one set of silver vases incorporating and contradicting Antiquarian Stephen Peet`s religious arguments; these vases underscore the pervasive cultural importance of archaeology to the infrastructure of American identity. Ferreira, Francisco [18] see McEwan, Colin Ferring, Reid (University of North Texas) [231] Geology and Formation Processes at the Aubrey Clovis Site The Aubrey Clovis site is buried 7.5-9 m below the flood plain of the Trinity River in north central Texas. This large multi-component occupation was situated near a spring fed pond and the river channel. Artifact and faunas in two camps and a bison kill/processing area were quickly buried by fine-grained overbank deposits, preserving an excellent record of features and artifact clusters, documenting a range of activities dated to ca. 11,550 rcybp. Data from soils, bone taphonomy and spatial patterning are used to reconstruct the site formation processes during and after the brief occupations. Ferris, Jennifer [120] see Andrefsky, William Ferris, Neal (University of Western Ontario) [60] Constant Contacts and Profound Localisms: The Implications of Interregional Interaction for "Contact" Archaeology The importance of interregional interaction in the Eastern Woodlands has been long established. Nassaney, Sassaman, Fox, Jamieson and others point to prosaic, spiritual and non-material manifestations of interaction to underscore how knowing the world - conceptually, materially, cosmologically - beyond the palisade or local drainage helped shape internal innovation among societies. But this growing cosmopolitan sense of the world in the centuries before European contact has been characterized as a period of "profound localism" by

scholars buttressing post-contact assumptions of dramatically changed Indigenous behaviour. Acknowledging the sophistication and antiquity of interregional interaction re-contextualizes European "contact" within this long term and ongoing Native-centric worldview. Fie, Shannon (Beloit College) and William Green (Beloit College) [162] Archaeology at Beloit College: New Approaches for an Established Program Beloit College trains many undergraduates who become professional archaeologists. Archaeology at Beloit also engages students who pursue other careers. On-campus museum and archaeological resources, and Beloit anthropology`s longevity and tradition of innovation, contribute to our success. Current restructuring of the anthropology major offers new opportunities for students interested in archaeology. The goal is to provide students with the necessary skills to conduct research. Key elements of the revised curriculum include distinct stages at which students develop, present, and assess research. Along with continuing field and lab opportunities, the new curriculum promises to engage students more deeply in doing anthropology. Fiedel, Stuart (Louis Berger Group) [90] Is That All There Is? The Weak Case for Pre-Clovis Occupation of Eastern North America After decades of futile exploration and argumentation, the case for a pre-Clovis human presence in eastern North America still relies on just a handful of sites. The evidence ranges from nearly credible (Cactus Hill, Meadowcroft, Wisconsin kill sites) to very implausible (Topper, Saltville). Despite credulous acceptance by mass media, wildly speculative hypotheses, suggesting a European origin of the Clovis complex and its abrupt demise due to a comet impact, are probably fallacious.

[72] A Pilot Provenance Study of Intermountain Ware Ceramics in Western Wyoming In this study we examine 50 sherds from four sites to understand ceramic vessel source area variation in the Central Rocky Mountains and Wyoming Basin. Intermountain Ware ceramics are a diagnostic marker of Shoshone ethnicity, and our central hypothesis explores changing mobility during the terminal Late Prehistoric and early Historic Periods ca. AD 1700-1830. We use instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) and petrographic analysis to characterize clay and temper mineralogy. INAA places ceramic artifacts into four groups with some overlap between sites in southwest and northwest Wyoming. Temper composition supports INAA indicating ceramic vessels may have been transported long distances before their eventual discard. Finley, Judson Byrd [228] see Scheiber, Laura L. Finney, Bruce [175] see Misarti, Nicole; [27] see Lech, Veronica Fischer, Alysia (Miami University) [17] Gender and Glass: An Historical and Contemporary Consideration Cross-culturally, glassblowing has historically been a man`s profession. There have been many barriers to women becoming glassblowers, including cultural beliefs about women`s roles in society and assumptions about women`s physical abilities. Beginning in the 1960s, studio glassblowing was practiced in the US within an art, rather than craft, context and found its way into universities. Though this shift made it possible for women to engage in glassblowing, written histories continue to highlight achievements of men and rarely mention women. This paper reconsiders that history, the demographic changes since that time, and the continued barriers to women working as glassblowers. Fischer, Ben [165] see Davis, Judy L. Fish, Paul (University of Arizona) and Suzanne Fish (University of Arizona) [242] Trincheras Sites: Landscapes, Summits, and Ideology After A.D. 1200, hill sites proliferate across vase areas of northwest Mexico and the southern reaches of the U.S. Southwest. This transregional pattern is often linked to the intensification of conflict. However, we argue that ideology provides an equally vital and valid framework for understanding the societal significance of this late prehispanic phenomenon. Using case studies from the Rio Magdalena Basin of northwest Sonora and the Tucson Basin of southern Arizona, we examine trincheras sites as differential elements of settlement pattern and landscape and their features and summit precincts as facilities of ritual practice. Regional ethnography offers intriguing models for the nature of summit features, their relationship to ceremonial cycles and settlement hierarchies, and the ritual landscapes into which they fit. Fish, Suzanne [242] see Fish, Paul R. Fisher, Chelsea (College of Wooster) [204] Resorting to the Resort: A Museum's Relationship With the Archaeology of Roatán Island, Honduras Despite over 100 years of informal and formal visits, surveys, and excavations, little is known about the prehistory of the Bay Islands, Honduras. Recent and ongoing construction associated with the growing tourism industry on the islands has had a significant impact on the island`s archaeological resourc es. Yet, tourism has also popularized interest in the island`s ancient inhabitants. This poster considers the structure and function of an archaeology museum at one resort on Roatán Island, and assesses its perceived effectiveness in conveying information about the prehispanic islanders and the need to protect archaeological sites.

Using data from this site, I discuss how butchering and consumption practices of the past can be elucidated from statistical analysis of faunal remains. Supporting evidence from human coprolites and experimental data on rabbit roasting and boiling are presented to provide additional lines of evidence. It is anticipated that such data will offer important information for understanding processing decisions at a site possibly related to communal jackrabbit drives. Fisher, Lynn (Univ of Illinois Springfield), Corina Knipper (University of Mainz), Rainer Schreg (Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum) and Susan Harris (University of Tübingen) [184] Neolithic Chert Acquisition Features on the Swabian Alb, Germany Recent investigations at the chert quarry site of Asch-Borgerhau, near Blaubeuren, Germany, documented visible surface features and chert acquisition pits dating from the Early/Middle to Final Neolithic. This poster investigates the form and fill of quarry features in 6 test trenches. Variations in pit fill and in the density and distribution of raw material, artifacts, and charcoal suggest that a diverse set of chert acquisition and production activities shaped this extensive archaeological landscape. Comparisons to quarry features in neighboring regions are used to frame hypotheses about the organization of Neolithic chert acquisition on the Swabian Alb limestone plateau.

A sequence of 11 radiocarbon dates was used to partition the Middle Archaic occupation along the Owyhee River in southeast Oregon into distinct assemblages. Principal Components Analysis was used to assess similarities and differences in assemblage composition during this period of occupation. The 11 assemblages consist of various lithic artifacts, shell, mammal, and non-mammal bone. Results show the site was used for different activities over a 3,000 year span of time.

understanding aspects of cultural evolution and the underpinnings of social complexity. Whereas conventional anthropological applications of intensification` focus most often on evolutionary results of intensified production (more food per capita), behavioral ecologists seek to explore individual motivations and consequences of intensified effort (more work per unit output). This paper will explore a key semantic confusion arising from the juxtaposition of these two approaches as a means of developing a bridging model linking the two aspects of intensification at both adaptive and evolutionary scales.

Floss, Harald [157] Lithic Raw Material Procurement Patterns in the Aurignacian of the Swabian Jura, southwestern Germany The Swabian Jura belongs to the most important areas of palaeolithic occupation in Central Europe. The Swabian Aurignacian has yielded an outstanding amount of information about early Upper Paleolithic chronology and the arrival of anatomically modern humans in that area. It has as well yielded about 50 examples of mobile art and numerous items of personal adornment. The analysis of lithic raw materials tends to detect mobility patterns of early Upper Paleolithic hunter gatherers and to confront these results with those of the last Neandertals in this part of Central Europe. Flynn, Christopher [219] see Walz, Gregory R. Fogelin, Lars (Univ. of Arizona) [194] Fallback Philosophy: The Worst Offense is a Perfect Defense This paper critiques the use of the negation strategy by processual archaeologists and constructivism by post-processual archaeologists. I argue that archaeologists rarely employ a negation strategy or constructivism in the creation of archaeological explanations. Rather, archaeologists only deploy these theories in defense of explanations created using other means. In either case, archaeologists create an impregnable fortress of skepticism that only diminishes their archaeological conclusions. Foley Winkler, Kathleen (University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee) [105] Oneota and Langford Mortuary Practices from Eastern Wisconsin and Northeast Illinois Two archaeologically identified mortuary programs for Developmental Horizon Oneota in southeast Wisconsin suggest different underlying social and/or political structures. Three key issues are addressed. First, a case is made for the ways that burial data are expected to inform about social, political, and economic structures in the late prehistoric Midwest United States. Second, eastern Wisconsin Oneota burial programs are compared with contemporaneous Langford and Oneota sites of northern Illinois. Last, data collected provide a regional discussion of culture contact and diversity and are used to examine whether or not violence was present among the Wisconsin Oneota sites. Follensbee, Billie (Missouri State University) [260] Gender-Neutral and Gender-Ambiguous Costume in Formative Period Gulf Coast Cultures, and its Implications Recent studies of sex and gender in Formative Period Gulf Coast art and archaeology reveal that certain costume elements are strongly gender-associated, while others are gender-neutral. Still other attire may be more strongly associated with one gender, but in certain, specific situations may appear on members of the opposite gender. These more ambiguous garments appear to be primarily associated with a status or an office. The fact that costume associated with different levels of status appears on both male and female figures, and on individuals of differing age, is particularly meaningful for our understanding of Formative Period Gulf Coast society. Fontana, Marisa [217] Of Walls and War: Fortification and Warfare in the Mississippian Southeast This paper explores late pre-contact indigenous fortifications in the American Southeast to examine what these constructions can tell us regarding the nature of Mississippian warfare. I use the Mississippian site of Canebreak in east-central Alabama as a case study to illustrate how archaeologists can determine the difference between defensive and non-defensive architecture in the context of Mississippian warfare. The timing of the appearance and development of fortifications has the potential to show patterns that document the evolution of sociopolitical relationships between neighboring sites and/or polities--the cycling of raiding and trading, or war and peace.

Yet they all experienced a long process of collapse, apparently associated with climate change. This paper will investigate the logical issues involved in cross-regional analyses of relationships between community behavior, and the long-term ecological interaction between lowdensity urbanism and global climate change. The analysis has implications for the potential trajectories of the increasingly prevalent, low-density urban settlements of the industrial world.

Nevertheless, an experiment is most useful if it can be replicated, and an experiment`s results are most valuable when all major influencing inputs are reported and understood.

Foor, Thomas [39] see Prentiss, Anna Marie Ford, Anabel (UCSB) [241] The Sustainable Landscape of the Ancient Maya From the initial settlement of the Maya lowlands 3,000 years ago, populations grew, cities ebbed and flowed, and land use became intense. The prosperity of the Classic and the continuity of language and practice into colonial times underscores successful adaptation to the landscape built on experience that back into the Archaic and founded on the milpa-forest garden management system. The Maya adaptation depended on an intimate understanding and dynamic use of their landscape. Based on our predictive model of the Maya settlement, we present a model of the land use and calculate a population density for the El Pilar area. [241] Discussant Ford, Ben (Texas A&M University) [247] Changes in Perception and Perceptions of Change on the Lake Ontario Shore Littoral environments are never static; water rises and falls, transportation networks open and close, and resource come and go on daily, seasonal, and longer time scales. The perception of these changes also shifts with time and variations in culture. Perceptions of less mutable features of the Lake Ontario shore (e.g. the international boundary and the threat of storms) have shifted with time as well. How maritime cultures perceived both change and continuity affected their interactions with the shore environment and the substance of the archaeological record. Data for this analysis was drawn from a combined terrestrial and maritime archaeological survey. Ford, Ben [19] see Crabtree, Stefani A. Formica, Tracy (URS Corporation) [179] Lithics Really Do Talk Back: A Comparison of Sites 33PE838 and 33PE839 Phase III archaeological investigations at 33PE838 and 33PE839, both multi-component Archaic, Woodland, and Late Prehistoric period sites in the Rush Creek watershed, Perry County, Ohio, yielded some 18,000 lithic artifacts. As lithics are enduring and the most common type of artifact generally found at prehistoric sites in the Ohio Valley region, site interpretation generally is heavily weighted by lithic data interpretation. This paper compares the lithic assemblages from sites 33PE838 and 33PE839. To aid interpretation of archaeologicallyderived lithic assemblages, the results reiterate the need for a flexible analysis framework, gathering information from multiple lines of evidence, and experimental replication studies.

Long term studies using compositional analyses have permitted us to determine manufacturing sources and subsequent routes of dissemination. Archaeological recovery has generally resulted in Chablekal Fine Gray being placed earlier in the ceramic sequence than Fine Orange Ware. Recent investigation at Cancuen however, has revealed the presence of an early Fine Orange, which appears to come from newly recognized sources. Here, we present these new findings and situate Cancuen`s involvement in a long distance movement of pottery. [229] First Chair Forsman, Leonard A. [203] see Lewarch, Dennis E. Forsythe, Lauren (Southern Illinois University Carbondale) and Heather A. Lapham (Southern Illinois University Carbondale) [26] Cut Mark Analysis and Tool Identification at the Berry Site Using

Scanning Electron Microscopy Fort San Juan, built in 1568 adjacent to Joara, a large Native American town in western North Carolina (known collectively as the Berry site), provides a unique opportunity to examine the relationships that developed between the Spanish soldiers and the native townspeople. We examined cut marks left on animal bones discarded in fort middens using a scanning electron microscope to determine if stone or metal tools were used to butcher and prepare meat for consumption within the garrison. Our results indicate the butchery scars were made by stone tools, which suggests the soldiers were supplied with meat by the native Joarans. Forte, Maurizio [230] 3D Collaborative Environments in Archaeology This paper aims at introducing an innovative approach to cyberarchaeology in relation to the need to investigate what happens in 3D immersive collaborative environments where every user is embodied in cyberspace through participatory activities. Different virtual platforms of participatory learning and collaborative environments are able to create diverse outcome for research and training. UCM is currently working on the creation of a network of collaborative immersive environments. They will allow scholars to collaboratively interpret and reconstruct archaeological artefacts, sites and landscapes on the basis of participatory immersive interactions (Powerwall, Teleimmersive Systems) and 3D web virtual cyberspaces. Fortier, Andrew (Illinois Transportation Archaeological Research Pr) [30] Preliminary Analysis of Prehistoric Dog Coprolite Samples from the American Bottom, Southwestern Illinois Coprolites are fossilized feces that are rarely encountered in open-air archaeological contexts in the Midwest. Recent Excavations at the Janey B. Goode site in metropolitan East St. Louis have recovered just over 100 discrete, well-preserved, desiccated coprolite samples that date from A.D. 900-1000. Preliminary analysis indicates that these coprolites are from dogs. Analysis is ongoing and is aimed at reconstructing diet, health standards and the genetic make-up of this dog population. Macro-analysis has revealed the undigested remains of animal bone, teeth, fish scales, plant remains, sinew and hair. Future blood panels, and parasite/bacteria analyses will be conducted to determine levels of health and nutrition. Fortin, Louis (Washington State Univ.)

A.D. 1050 ­ 1130. Research was completed to aid in the identification of the depositional processes that affected Cox Ranch Pueblo during post-abandonment, specifically Roomblocks 1 and 4. Off-site natural samples were also collected for reference. Samples collected from these units were put through a suite of pedological analyses (pH, electro-conductivity, % organic, % CaCO, particle size) to determine the differences in natural and cultural strata. Results were then compared with previous geoarchaeological analysis of alluvial processes to identify regional similarities in the deposition sequence. Foster, Elise (U.S.D.A. Office of the General Counsel) [86] Proposed Amendments to ARPA on Restitution and Use of Funds Collected ARPA enforcement since the statute was enacted has shown that fines and penalties collected in enforcement actions can be applied to restoration and repair of resources. However, this does not uniformly occur. The Government can optimize archaeological resource protection without an increase in spending by enacting certain amendments to ARPA. The suggested amendments will: 1) make restitution mandatory in ARPA enforcement cases; and 2) create statutory authority for agencies to use funds collected through penalties, fines and restutiton to fund restoration and repair of resources or to otherwise further the purpose of ARPA.

Foster, Jennifer (University at Buffalo) [243] Social Circles: Raths and Status in Early Medieval Ireland Over 40,000 raths dot the countryside in Ireland; these defensivelooking bank-and-ditch enclosures have long been considered the homes of the middle and upper classes of the Early Medieval period. But recent archaeological evidence suggests otherwise: not all raths have yielded "high status" material upon excavation, while others may have remained vacant. This paper will examine the multiple roles raths held in the Early Medieval landscape: who lived within their walls and who did not, where other people lived, and how perceptions of "status" cloud archaeological interpretation. Fowler, Catherine (University of Nevada) [211] Discussant Fowler, Don (University of Nevada Reno) [248] Discussant Fowles, Severin (Barnard College, Columbia University) [14] On Narrative in Southwest Archaeology I propose a return to the grand narrative in Southwest archaeology-- or, at least, a return to a serious engagement with those metahistories inevitably constructed from archaeological statements by the public. Over the past three decades, critiques of social evolutionary theory have prompted widespread retreat into questions of the individual, the short-term, the historically contingent and the idiosyncratic, accompanied by a growing theoretical focus on more intimate matters of meaning, memory, perception and agency. Fine. But ignoring old metahistories hardly makes them disappear. Compelling counternarratives are needed, and here I look for guidance to both indigenous Pueblo and anarchist perspectives. Fox, William (Canadian Museum of Civilization) [60] Reciprocal Symbols Individual examples of symbolically equivalent item exchange over considerable distances during the early seventeenth century are presented.

This paper compares the variation in frequency and type of production reflected in shell and stone tool-making debris at domestic contexts across the city and identifies several localities where surplus production and multicrafting is evident. Major lithic workshops focused primarily on late production stages while all phases of marine shell-working were commonly represented. We identify differences in the continuum of production between houses with modest quantities of debris and surplus workshops and the significance of these patterns for understanding occupational specialization at the city.

Freedman, Jacob (Gray & Pape, Inc.) [252] Deep Testing Methodology, The Black Dirt Peat Deposits, Warwick, New York This paper describes the methods used to investigate the Black Dirt peat deposits located in the Town of Warwick, New York. Fieldwork consisted of 2, 3- by 3-meter hand excavated environmental boxes. These boxes permitted the recovery of bulk soil samples to the base of the peat deposit, approximately 2.2 m.b.s. To accomplish this, dewatering, hydraulic shoring, a manually operated crane, and fall protection systems were used to permit safe, OSHA-compliant excavation. These samples will be used to reconstruct the post glacial environment to better understand the Pine Island Archaeological District and general climate trends in the Northeast.

The enclosed court at La Venta, with its restrictive construction and placement of caches and sacred bundles, served as an Olmec architectural configuration that also functioned as a cosmic diagram serving as a stage for rituals of world renewal. The commonality in cosmograms at these two exemplary North American ceremonial centers suggests the presence of a foundational religious sensibility informing ritual practice in these two cultural areas.

Archaeological research in the Copan Valley, Honduras has produced a rich data set from which to examine the Late Classic/Terminal Classic population trends associated with the "Collapse" from a multi-scalar perspective. This paper, employing architectural, survey, and excavation data, reconstructs the complex sociopolitical process of the valley`s depopulation. By articulating regional settlement trends with building-specific abandonment events, agricultural processes and detailed chronology, a multi-scalar picture of paleodemographic trends emerges.

Who decided whether or not to feed the intruders? Are Iberian food preferences or aversions manifested in the archaeological record? Did the Joaran farmers--probably women--benefit or suffer (or both) from the presence of foreigners--all men--who needed their crops for survival? Archaeobotanical remains from the Berry Site are examined and compared to those from other early Spanish contact sites in the Southeast in order to address these issues.

Possible sacred cave and rock shelter sites include the cave at Big Moniteau Rock, Cliff Cave, and the Mitchell Site rockshelter. Fullerton, Ben (Geo-Marine, Inc.), Arlo McKee (Geo-Marine, Inc.) and Duane Peter (Geo-Marine, Inc.) [231] Cultural Dynamics during the Late Prehistoric Period in Northcentral Texas Investigations at site 41COL172 within the woodlands/prairie ecotone of northcentral Texas have revealed numerous Pennington Punctated-Incised ceramic sherds in association with bison remains between A.D. 1000 and 1300. Three prevailing models exist for the late prehistoric use of the woodlands/prairie ecotone: (1) Caddoan hunting parties from the east ventured out onto the prairie when bison were present; (2) Caddoan farmers migrated into the area to establish new villages; and (3) a local population occupied this ecotone and borrowed readily from surrounding cultures. This well preserved site containing bison remains and early Caddo-influenced pottery provides new evidence for evaluating these models.

The research focuses on identifying ecosystem changes resulting from invasive species predation, Aleut resource management and on understanding Aleut and Russian cultural and environmental adaptations during contact between the societies. The work counters historic records to show that Aleuts were present in larger numbers, lived more fully on the landscape than expected, and did indeed modify landscapes and wildlife to satisfy their way of life.

The study of Sardinian Bronze Age lithic technology and the exchange networks which created and maintained an island-wide identity as seen through the presence of its distinctive nuraghi has received little attention despite the wealth of knowledge it is capable of yielding.

Frink, Liam (University of Nevada Las Vegas) [17] Gendered Specialized Production of Seal Pokes and Storage among western Arctic Hunter-gatherers Seals and their products were the backbone of Arctic communities; critical as food, tools, clothing, medicines, fuel, and central to community identity. But little research has shed light on the techniques of processing and storage. An innovative invention were seal pokes--whole seal skins wherein dried fish were stored and seal fat was rendered into oil. This paper explores the use and manufacture of seal pokes and storage and investigates possible archaeological signatures and if this method of storage may have fluoresced during the early colonial period as a demand for fish and oil for trade intensified. Fritz, Carole and Gilles Tosello (Centre Emile Cartailhac, Université de Toulouse) [104] Master or Apprentice? Tradition or innovation? Man or woman?: Reflections on the identity and role of the artists in Paleolithic societies of Europe In studies of European Upper Paleolithic art, results are usually at the level of a cultural group. It is less easy to approach Paleolithic art at the level of the individual artist. For example, what was the part of women? Thanks to microscopic analyses of engravings, we can identify the degrees of aptitude or experience, apprenticeship, and the transmission of techniques. Clearly, there are some rules for drawing. Does the respect for or transgression of these norms reflect some aspects of freedom? Using some selected examples, we discuss how to better perceive the anonymous artists through their practices. Fritz, Crystal [92] Pottery and Emergent Complexity in Southeastern Arabia The concept of heterarchy as an organizing principle has been usefully employed in the study of emergent complexity in new world archaeology.

Gabe, Caroline (University of New Mexico) [193] Plaza Communities and the Vecino Household: An Archaeological Perspective How does plaza organization influence the expression of vecino household structure and spatial configuration? The plaza village is a common historical expression in northern New Mexico, which evolved in tandem with the political changes that shaped the Spanish frontier. Plaza organization affected the associated individuals and households within vecino villages and the spatial organization of gendered activities. Taking the Ranchos de Taos and Taos parishes as a case study, this paper analyzes plaza community layouts from multiple perspectives, as well as their possible affects on social organization and community arrangement. Gabelmann, Olga [94] A Society in Change?: The Formative Period in the Cochabamba Valleys The Formative Period society in the Cochabamba region is often depicted as a homogeneous, non-stratified, agriculturalist society with purely monochrome pottery and a lack of monumental architecture. Recent excavations in Santa Lucía revealed a pottery production center with separate workshops and a production output that goes far beyond the producers needs, hence creation of surplus. In addition, the site played an active role in long-distance trade with the highlands, the lowlands and the Pacific coast. This gives room for new interpretations. Is the Formative society more complex than it appears? Gage, Mathew D. [24] see Yerka, Stephen J.

[109] Reconstructing Social Shifts through Monumental Architecture: a Maya Palace-Temple Case from Kiuic, Yucatan, Mexico Due to their hybrid nature, people and objects cannot be analyzed as separated entities; the changes in one entity are necessarily reflected in the other. Monumental architecture, an object constructed to last a long time in a defined space, becomes a receptacle of accumulated meaning, memory and the social identity of communities interacting with it in their daily life. By reconstructing the social biography of a Maya palace-temple, trough the building`s recovered architectonic sequence and its general characteristics, I explore the possible social implications in the life of ancient Maya dwellers though this structure`s 1800 years construction history.

In Jamaica, these wares are accompanied by locally-made, glazed, and/or kiln-fired ceramics likely manufactured and marketed by enslaved specialists. Here we use data from over 600 shovel-test-pits excavated from the Papine slave village located outside of Kingston, Jamaica to explore the relationship between household-produced wares and specialist-produced ceramics. After establishing a village-wide chronology, we use systematic, quantitative evidence to track how the importance of household- and specialist-produced locally-made coarse earthenwares changed over time at Papine.

Maize first appears within Late Woodland settlements marked by persistent places, unusual landscape features, ceremonial events, and political centers. The special status of places with early maize is particularly relevant east of the Blue Ridge where Native societies were not horticulturalists prior to maize adoption. The incorporation of maize involved not simply an embracing of a new plant, but the reshaping of social relationships to accommodate becoming food growers.

It later became a focal point of German immigration to St. Louis shortly after its annexation in 1841. Block 1136 developed from 1860 to 1910 as a densely populated neighborhood of skilled workers of German ethnicity. In 2003, excavations in a portion of this block exposed three privy vaults. These features were abandoned ca. 1875-1885 after city sewer facilities became available.

"There must be limits," Sears wrote, "but until we have tried we shall not know what these limits are." Lewis Binford`s career has been about testing those limits combined with a genius for recognising patterns in archaeological data. His 1968 claim that "the practical limitations on our knowledge of the past are not inherent in the nature of the archaeological record" remains the most liberating statement archaeology has ever received.

[58] Discussant Gamble, Lynn (University of California, Santa Barbara) [154] Subsistence Practices and Feasting Rites: Chumash Choices after European Colonization What is interesting about the Chumash Indians of south central California is the persistence of long-established subsistence activities and the holding of religious feasts after European colonization. Although the Chumash used metal tools introduced by the Spanish to fashion cooking vessels and tools, they continued to produce these traditional items and consume traditional foods. In other words, they actively chose what to adopt from the Spanish based on their needs. Moreover, the continued use of baskets for the processing, cooking, and serving of plant resources reflect the significance of female gender roles both before and after Spanish contact.

Hearths in two contemporaneous Lower Columbia River plank-house villages illustrate the potential. Meier is a single large house with marked variation in hearth size, with smaller hearths in the house`s north end and a massive hearth complex in the south. This may be a communal hearth with the smaller one reserved for people living at the house`s northern end. In contrast, hearths at the multi-plank house Cathlapotle site are more uniform in size and structure, while associated faunal remains are more variable, suggesting inter-household production differences.

[200] Social Identity and Political Competition in a Culturally Diverse Landscape: Decorated Pottery from the Mescal Wash Site, Southeastern Arizona An analysis of Middle Formative period (A.D. 750-950) decorated sherds from the Mescal Wash site in southeastern Arizona highlights the use of painted serving vessels as media for expressing social identity under conditions of political competition and instability. Southeastern Arizona was a culturally diverse landscape, and interaction among peoples of different backgrounds was recurrent, creating a heightened awareness of identity. A large excavated collection and fine-grained chronology permitted a detailed quantitative study of changes in decorated ceramic use, which suggests that social identities were fluid and ephemeral in response to rampant social change and disruption.

It has been proposed that many cities after Teotihuacan decline have a defensive function. These military attributions have been questioned. Some scholars have said that walls in other archaeological sites in Mesoamerica and beyond, had ritual, ceremonial or territorial delimitation character. Recent excavations supported by former explorations at one of the main entrance to the city, show that between A.D. 650 and 1100 these architectural features had a defensive function, even though they enclosed areas where different kind of activities were conducted, including ritual ones.

The heterogenic character of these hoards ­ especially the third one, where except super blades appeared crested specimens and retouched tools suggest a rather utilitarian character, than a symbolic or prestigious one. Due to the context they were found in, they can be linked to a great extend with storage purposes. Gaudzinski-Windheuser, Sabine [184] see Kindler, Lutz Gauthier, Rory P.

The plant remains from directly dated specimens of several key sites are considered with regard to resource ranking, seasonality, local environmental setting, and site use histories.

However, there is no known identification of BTC between these locations. This study provides the first known chemical data on ceramics from Angel Mounds which determined, via XRF, that 70% of ceramics (n=40) have elevated P2O5 concentrations (>1 wt% P2O5) reflecting the possible presence of bone. SEM element mapping indicates that finegrained phosphate is disseminated throughout the ceramics indicating that highly processed bone was utilized as the likely temper. These results provide new insights into ceramic manufacturing techniques employed at Angel Mounds. Gerke, Tammie L. [257] see Marshall, Joel; [257] see Elswick, Erika R.

Gibb, Heather (University of Missouri-Columbia) [74] Metric Refitting Using Modern Deer (Odocoileus spp.) Anatomical refitting has been used to monitor the spatial distribution of animal skeletons throughout a site and to reconstruct meat sharing. What has not been tested is whether the assumptions of bilateral symmetry and of inter- and intra-membral matching are valid. These assumptions are evaluated using a modern collection of deer (Odocoileus spp.) bones from known individuals, focusing on linear measurements because these are more objective than visual comparison of skeletal elements. The assumptions are found to be largely unsupported. In large archaeological samples, individual specimens will likely be found to have more than one possible matching or refitting specimen.

The changes in local production, development of new industries, and access to imports and wealth all contributed to resident`s interpretation and creation of their socio-economic standing through material means.

A review of published Complex A maps demonstrates how these drawings have superceded textually presented excavation data in disseminating archaeological knowledge. Because of the reliance on maps, the most important 1955 conclusions regarding Complex A have been neglected.

Gilman, Patricia (University of Oklahoma) [248] Farmers Who Forage: Low Populations in the Mimbres Region of Southwestern New Mexico Archaeologists have assumed that large pithouse sites in the Southwest housed many people and that they were the foci of sedentary occupations supported by an agricultural economy. Based on reconsideration of Pithouse period sites in the Mimbres region of southwestern New Mexico, I argue that population sizes of even the large villages were much smaller, perhaps only a single family. Furthermore, their presumed agricultural economy was wedded to a degree of mobility that we associate with foragers. This research indicates that, because there were relatively few people, they could maintain a fairly sedentary, agricultural existence while still also being residentially mobile.

Amazing preservation of the site`s earliest deposits has provided some intriguing clues to late Pleistocene-early Holocene human occupation of the eastern Great Basin with over 30 hearth features and associated radiocarbon dates, cut-marked faunal remains, diagnostic lithic remains, and preserved bone needles and cordage.

Heizer and Hester`s 1978 report on Black Canyon is the first published archaeological study of this style, and for that reason Black Canyon can be regarded as the type-site for the style. It is often referenced in passing, but scholarly publications or even focused grey-literature studies of Pahranagat-style rock art sites within the past 30 years are alarmingly scarce. A recent study examined all of the panels at the type site in detail, and thorough survey of the surrounding landscape identified a number of associated sites. What the study has revealed about the age of this rock art style, and the factors that account for its narrow temporal and spatially restricted distribution are presented.

Biface analyses suggest the presence of numerous fluted-point styles and the on-site manufacture of points. These data provide an opportunity to further evaluate technological change and landscape use throughout the late Pleistocene. The repeated use of the Plenge site during this time period and the utilization of local lithic sources show similarities to other large Paleoindian sites in the region.

While it is true that many peoples of the Middle Horizon may not have fallen under the rubric of direct imperial control, others certainly did, and it is this variability that is classically "imperial."

Here we review the evidence for these climatic shifts and consider the effects they had on humans in the region, especially the greater Bonneville and Lahontan basins. A well-watered Bonneville basin was a boon for early humans; however, in the Lahontan basin higher lakes may have had the opposite effect, since archaeological sites of the Younger Dryas are rare in comparison to the subsequent early Holocene.

The degree of similarities between contexts is the result of repetition and reproduction of practice through space and time. Potentially stable contexts (i.e Bronze Age burials), resulting from highly regulated socio-cultural behavior, can display deviations escaping contextual rationalization. It could be theorize that in specific environments, the deviant behavior is the result of an emotional event that overrides rational constructs. Emotion in this context could be approached through the impact it has on the archaeological record to understand the motivation of the gesture that modifies an established behavioral pattern.

Drawing upon preliminary XRF documentation and stylistic comparison of headstones from High Island, Inis Airc, Bofin Island, Caher Island and at Teampaill Chiaráin on Insihmore, we explore the questions of production of headstones, the geographical spread of these from known source areas, and the placement of headstones within different island communities. This research provides critical new perspectives on the Early Christian landscape of this region.

Phase 2 excavations revealed evidence of a yard midden and features including a cesspool and a privy. Artifacts recovered show evidence of school activities such as reading, writing, laundry, sewing, cooking, canning/preserving and painting. Ceramic analysis indicates that vessels were most likely donated to the school due to their variety of

decorative styles and maker's marks. This site has the ability to address questions regarding gender and social power, institutionalized behavior and moral regulations, and socioeconomic status and consumer choice.

The results of the study are then used to critique the ways in which archaeological data have been used and misused in the heritage tourism industry to represent past inhabitants of the island. The future of tourism and issues of representation on the island are also considered. [204] Second Chair [204] Second Organizer Goodyear, Albert (SC Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology) [90] Clovis and Post Clovis Paleoindian Manifestations in the Central Savannah River Region The central Savannah River region in the Coastal Plain of Georgia and South Carolina occupies a significant geographic niche in the South Atlantic Coastal Plain. At 33 N, it was a major geographic ecotone during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition 16 to 10k yrs. ago. An abundant supply of chert attracted Paleoindians over a 2,000 year period. Systematic surveys and excavations over the past 25 years have provided a reasonable framework to examine technological and settlement responses in this region of the Southeast. A possible demographic decline occurred during the Younger Dryas based on a reduction in post Clovis projectile points. Dalton is a response to modern climatic conditions.

This enables a glance into the meaning of intra-Acheulo-Yabrudian variability and contributes towards a new understanding of Middle Pleistocene hominin adaptation and capabilities at the end of the Lower Paleolithic in the Levant. The discovery of Hominin teeth at Qesem Cave may provide a link between the abovementioned cultural processes and biological evolution.

Mandel (University of Kansas / Kansas Geological Survey) [259] Modeling the Geologic Potential for Cultural Resources in the Upper Neosho River Basin, East-Central Kansas A GIS-based geoarchaeological approach was used to develop a predictive model for locating surficial and buried cultural resources in the upper Neosho River basin of east-central Kansas. Lithostratigraphy and digital soil survey data (SSURGO) were used to estimate the relative ages of geomorphic surfaces and the underlying late Quaternary deposits. Radiocarbon dating combined with soilstratigraphic investigations was used to test the model. Results of this study indicate that surface soils are fairly reliable indicators of the relative age of landforms and genetically related packages of sediment and associated buried soils. Graf, Kelly (CSFA, Texas A&M University) and Nancy Bigelow (Alaska Quaternary Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks) [224] Human Technological Responses to the Younger Dryas in Central Alaska Human response to climatic conditions during the tumultuous terminal Pleistocene has long been a concern of archaeologists and paleoecologists alike. Some researchers propose that production of microblade technology was an optimal choice for foragers placed in high-risk situations such as subsisting in arctic environments during the late Pleistocene. The microblade-bearing Denali complex in central Alaska, dating to 12.8-11.5 ka, may represent a human forager response to decline in climatic conditions and associated decrease in wood availability. Using archaeological and paleovegetation data from central Alaska, we explore the possible relationship between technology and regional ecology during the Younger Dryas cold event. Graf, Kelly E.

Historically, however, marginalized people have used borderlands as places of refuge where they could, with relative ease, move between nations.

Greaves, Russell (Peabody Museum, Harvard) [119] How Ethnoarchaeology gets Scientific Eyes: Binford`s Dynamic Ethnoarchaeological Tools to build Archaeological Views beyond Static Technology and Just-so Individual Events Lewis Binford has helped revolutionize the roles and methods of ethnoarchaeological inquiry into formation of the archaeological record. While other approaches focus on direct analogies with past technologies, his influential work studied people using modern tools in contexts of activities relevant to improving knowledge of past behaviors. Binford`s views of technology showed that activities organize associations and roles beyond expectations based on artifact material class and the temporal scale of ethnographic experience. Binford inspired me to examine dynamic ethnoarchaeological relationships of subsistence and technological use moving beyond classificatory orientation to seek patterns addressing deeper time scales of archaeological site formation. Greber, N'omi (Cleveland Museum of Natural History) and Robert Horn (Earlham College) [176] Interpreting Earthen Walls as Markers of Knowledge Questions concerning origins and purpose of hundreds of earthen walls that formed the ancient landscape of the Middle Ohio Valley were integral in 19th and early 20th century avocational and ultimately professional publications. Relatively recent field work provides new data on chronology and use of several large earthwork sites. Using old and new data we consider size and accuracy of earthworks built as simple geometric shapes. We discuss context for earthwork construction seen in aspects of the builders' physical, social, and symbolic worlds. We suggest possible contextual changes in interpretations or implementations that resulted in particular earthwork constructions. Green, Debra [153] see Junker, Laura L.

Green, William (Logan Museum of Anthropology) [127] Persistent Placemaking in the Upper Mississippi River Valley: Ritual, Settlement, Interaction, and Appropriation The Upper Mississippi River Valley comprises a set of striking landscapes. Yet even within its diverse terrain, certain places literally stand out: mountains that appear to rise from water, mile-long ridges barely wide enough to camp on. While the cultural landscape is by definition a product of human agency, these dramatic natural landforms have served as unique, easily identified landmarks for millennia. Archaeological, ethnographic, and ethnohistoric data from the Turkey River Mounds State Preserve in Iowa and Perrot State Park (Trempealeau Mountain and adjacent Trempealeau Bluffs) in Wisconsin indicate periodic reappropriation of ideologically-charged or ritual space at these places. Green, William [162] see Fie, Shannon M. Greene, Alan (University of Chicago) and Charles Hartley (University of Chicago) [240] The Structure of Ceramic Analysis: Multiple Scales and Instruments in the Analysis of Production As the analytical capabilities for the detection and interpretation of pottery attributes have expanded, the essential distinction in ceramic investigation between "structural" and "compositional" data has provided a framework for situating various analyses. In contrast to studies relying solely on compositional attributes, we outline a holistic approach that combines elemental data with information pertaining to formation, decoration, and firing techniques in an anthropological effort to delineate the socioeconomic aspects of particular pottery industries. We argue that the inclusion of such structural data is essential to forming a systematic understanding of ceramic production across geographies, political economies, and artistic traditions.

The anomalies had been discovered during nearsurface magnetic gradiometry survey and further examined via sediment coring and downhole magnetic susceptibility measurements. Our goal was to characterize physically, chemically, geophysically and chronometrically the deposits associated with the anomalies. Here we summarize the fieldwork and compare what we found with what was predicted based on the near-surface and downhole magnetic data.

To avoid the pitfalls of a poorly designed urban archaeological project, MoDOT archaeologists developed a complex

research design for this large-scale project. The research design focuses on deposits, not sites, and depends on defining appropriate methodologies and developing a robust model for evaluation significance. By evaluating interrelated properties, the end result will be research that will define what is significant in St. Louis. Greer, John (Greer Services Archeology) and Mavis Greer (Greer Services Archeology) [22] Graffiti: To Clean or Not to Clean, that is the Question Cleaning rock art sites and cave interiors of graffiti is popular and is often supported without question. The practice has been questioned recently due to aboriginal art removed during cleaning and a general lack of professional evaluation before removal. Other assumptions need to be evaluated, such as definition of graffiti versus potentially preservable art; whether use is attracted by previous use (graffiti attracting graffiti) rather than particular places attracting repeated use; what modern graffiti should be preserved; and who determines preservation or destruction of graffiti. Study and evaluation should be done prior to massive impromptu cleaning efforts commonly being done. Greer, John [171] see Greer, Mavis Greer, Mavis (Greer Services) and John Greer (Greer Services) [171] The Record of Northern Plains Warfare in Rock Art Conflict scenes on the Plains contain weapons, armor, and fighting postures. Separating warfare from other kinds of physical or spiritual conflict is difficult because these functions are portrayed in similar styles. Early abstract symbolism changed to more figurative dominated by humans, shields, weapons, and eventually scenes showing people pierced with spears and arrows, warriors holding severed heads, mounted warriors taking pedestrian slaves, and groups fighting. This shift in subject reflects changing values and practice, but other indicators are necessary to determine if scenes refer to warfare, simple conflict, rites of passage, ritual behavior, dances, games, hunting, or other group behavior. Greer, Mavis [22] see Greer, John Greer, Melissa and Linea Sundstrom (Day Star Research) [220] Coup Counts and Corn Caches: Contact-Era Plains Indian Accounts of Warfare Plains Indian documents such as rock art, winter counts, ledger-book drawings, and hide paintings record a wide range of motives, tactics, and outcomes for intergroup fighting. Different kinds of conflict recorded in these native documents include: large-scale attacks on horticultural villages; small-scale raids for horses, captives, and scalps; sustained campaigns to keep enemies (including non-Indians) out of hunting territories; defensive actions; and at least one captiverescue operation. Some conflicts are more likely than others to have left archaeological remains: in fact, the archaeological sites known as the Larsen and Leavenworth sites are mentioned in the Lakota winter counts. Other forms of conflict are not likely to show up archaeologically. This raises questions about whether sites like Crow Creek should be considered anomalous or representative of Late Prehistoric Plains life-ways.

Gremillion, Kristen [154] Cultural Transmission of Botanical Knowledge in Postcontact Eastern North America The exchange of plants and botanical knowledge across ethnic lines is a well known feature of culture change following European contact with North America. Such innovations spread partly as a function of their frequency. Limited interethnic contact thus favors cultural inertia because people tend to copy the practices of their parents and peers in the absence of alternatives. Inertia can be overcome by the opportunity to observe and positively evaluate unfamiliar methods of cooking, cultivating, and consuming plants. Archaeological and historical evidence provide partial support for this model, but the absence of resources, individual autonomy, and social equality introduce important constraints. Grier, Colin (Washington State University) and Patrick Dolan (Washington State University) [203] Human Settlement, Coastal Landforms, and Later Holocene Sea Level Change in southwestern British Columbia Reconstructing sea level change is critical for modeling ancient settlement on the Northwest Coast. Sea levels have been documented for the early Holocene on the southern British Columbia coast, but fewer data exist to characterize more recent changes. We present data derived from archaeological contexts on cuspate spits, an important coastal landform in the southern Gulf Islands. Our data accord well with recent characterizations of later Holocene sea levels as rising gradually over the last five millennia. We stress, however, that human modification and management of coastal environments must be considered to reconstruct how sea levels and human activity correlate.

This paper details twelve months of fieldwork among Samburu cattle pastoralists in northern Kenya aimed at redressing this problem. The Samburu employ an extensive system of pottery production and use despite their history of relatively high residential mobility. Discussed here will be pottery's perhaps surprisingly central role in Samburu society, one reason for which may be its ability to aid in the mitigation of constant environmental risk.

A warming trend began in the late Bølling and peaked in the early Younger Dryas. Near the Great Lakes, a distinct cooling trend is then evident beginning about 300 years after the beginning of the Younger Dryas interval in Greenland. A new modeling study indicates that the Bølling-Allerød and Younger Dryas intervals were very wet. Grimm, Sonja B.

The Chacha-Inka site of Posic was

constructed as part of Inka attempts to consolidate this internally diverse and rebellious province. Unlike elsewhere in Chachapoyas, where Inka political models relied on architectural and ceramic styles from the heartland, administrators at Posic made use of local ceramics in their occupation of the site. This may have resulted from a differential strategy adopted to control a distant area at the borders of their political domination.

Monumental Sites in the Norte Chico Region of Peru The Norte Chico region witnessed a florescence of large sites with monumental architecture in the 3rd millennium B.C. The terraced platform mounds, sunken plazas, upright monoliths and U-shaped layout established architectural and site patterns that radiated out and evolved into various manifestations from Sechin Alto, to Chavin de Huantar to Tiwanaku. These sites left an indelible mark not just Andean history, but also on the local landscape. They served as focal points for ceremonies, offerings and burials in later time periods ­ all intrusions in the archaeological record. The reuse of these sites demonstrates they were recognized as significant ancestral places for more than 2000 years after abandonment. Haas, Jonathan [138] see Rutherford, Allen Haas, W.R.

Haas, William (The University of Arizona) [248] Low-Level Food Producers and the Pursuit of Game on the Rainbow Plateau, Arizona In his observations on Basketmaker materials, A.V. Kidder noted an abundance of hunting-related goods amongst a dearth of game consumption evidence. More recent subsistence analyses reveal that Basketmaker cultigen consumption was comparable to that of later Puebloans. Towards reconciling this apparent contradiction, I use optimal foraging theory to show that early agricultural colonists to the Rainbow Plateau would have invested in the pursuit of game species even if they were rarely consumed. A significant correlation between the spatial distribution of Basketmaker sites and the habitats of highranked game species on the Plateau further supports this hypothesis. Haas, Jr., Wm.

The burial data suggest that for the Vikings interred throughout the Danelaw, warriorhood and masculinity were intertwined identities that were reinforced through embodied action, symbolic adornment and shared beliefs regarding the afterlife. Hale, Micah (UC Davis) [197] The Ideal Free Distribution and Discontinuous Socioeconomic Shifts The Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) model can be modified to predict discontinuous socioeconomic change among hunter gatherers, while retaining original model assumptions. I treat adaptive strategies as qualitatively different niches in the IFD model, one of these having a minimum population density requirement and lower initial niche quality, but higher maximum density thresholds. These conditions predict cyclical colonizing attempts prior to the successful occupation of the new, density dependent niche, followed by rapid depopulation of the original niche. I apply this model to explain an abrupt shift from Time Minimizing to Energy Maximizing in the archaeological record of southern California.

There are many questions and debates within WSA, especially WSA that is exploring ancient world-systems and their roles in shaping the modern world-system. These questions and debates are both theoretical and empirical, and typically at that stage where the theory ­ data ­ revision ­ more date ­ more revision cycle is moving rapidly. Thus, I seek to encourage archaeologists working on Eurasia not only to use recent WSA, but also to add to and/or emend it based on their findings. In short the "stimulus" is aimed toward the inductive side of the scientific process, where revisions of theory are driven by recent data. Halligan, Jessi (Texas A&M University)

[236] Preliminary Geoarchaeological Interpretation of a Submerged Paleoindian Site in the Aucilla River, Northwest Florida Thousands of osseous and stone Paleoindian artifacts have been recovered from the Aucilla River of northwestern Florida. Many of these lack context, limiting cultural interpretations. In this dissertation research, terrestrial and submerged coring and excavation are used to reconstruct the geoarchaeological context of a submerged sinkhole containing Paleoindian and Early Archaic components. Targeted excavation of Late Pleistocene cultural components are used to discuss human activity at this site. This record will then be compared to data from previously-excavated sites to create a synthetic site formation model for the region and to examine Paleoindian cultural patterns in the Aucilla basin.

Halperin, Christina (University of Illinois) [54] Maya State Collapse and Changes in Household Ritual:HistoryMaking from a Microscale Perspective In contrast to the politics of the state, households are often portrayed as the ultimate bearers of tradition. Nonetheless, when an archaeology of households is considered from a practice-orientated perspective, small-scale reproductions and changes not only become more visible, but can be seen as contributing factors to larger structural transformations. This paper examines household rituals, social practices, and symbolism during and after the so-called Classic period collapse to reveal the dynamic ways in which households negotiated, reproduced, and reinvented traditions. Special emphasis is placed on ceramic figurines, ritual termination deposits, and caches from Belize and Guatemala to highlight ways in which history-making manifested on a household-level.

This lack of temporal specificity may relate to differences in regional morphology through time coupled with misidentification of other point types as Pinto series. These issues will be discussed using a collection of 287 Pinto series points from the Great Salt Lake Desert of northwestern Utah.

Use-wear and residue analyses on a sample of over 200 tools from Hohle Fels, Vogelherd, and Geißenkolstërle reveal similar patterns of tool use within the Aurignacian. Tool types are not specialized but are used for multiple tasks. A similar range of materials are exploited from all three sites. Analysis of Middle Paleolithic tools from Hohle Fels suggests that Neanderthals and modern humans were using tools for similar activities.

It was site of an Inka provincial capital, and then colonized again as site of the first Spanish capital of Peru.

In this paper, I evaluate the capacity of bioarchaeology to investigate both physical and mental disability in the archaeological past. The value and limitations of such an approach are illustrated using a case study from pre-industrial Europe, an osteobiography of two individuals with a congenital malformation syndrome from the early medieval (c.

Using this research as a platform, I asked "What is the pattern of obsidian movement across southeastern Idaho in the Paleoindian time period, and to what extent does this indicate the use of the southeastern Idaho landscape?" After geochemically sourcing obsidian Paleoindian projectile points

This analysis suggests a persistent and tethered Paleoindian use of Southeastern Idaho. Harris, Lucille (University of Toronto) [108] Reconceptualizing an Expedient Flake Tool Technology from Interior British Columbia Variability in winter housepit economic activities in Interior British Columbia is commonly established through proportional differences in tool types using a morpho-functional classification system. In this paper I argue morpho-functional typologies are inappropriate for expedient flake tools because many of the defined types lack behavioral significance, force analysts into functional interpretations often based on arbitrary or unproven rules, and have the potential to significantly skew quantification and interpretation of the assemblages. Classification of individual worked edges according to edge angle and use damage is suggested as a more accurate and potentially interpretation free approach.

Pieces of obsidian were used as idols of gods, including the patron god of the ruling elite and thus the state as a whole, in the prehispanic Tarascan kingdom of West-central Mexico. Utilizing primarily ethnohistoric (documentary) evidence, I argue that it was the fact that obsidian is easily knapped that allowed pieces of obsidian to simultaneously be direct indexes of kingly power and focal points of historical oratory, ideal metaphors for kingly power, and self-evident agents that allowed conquest and the exercise of power by the elites to be fetishized and mystified as they were recast as divine mandates.

The changing decisions farmers have made over this long time reflect their social and political worlds. While the landscape has remained relatively stable, the perceptions of it and the farmer`s interactions have altered, at times radically. I focus on the changing land-use around Jauja Peru and how it reflects changing political situations, farmer`s decisions, political decisions and changes on the landscape.

Art was not a common topic for archaeologists to study. Ann Axtell Morris boldly researched rock art, mural painting and textiles, and wrote for the public as well as for scholars. Her popular books, "Digging in the Southwest" and "Digging in Yucatan," inspired generations of men and women to explore archaeology.

Hawkins, Nancy (Louisiana Div of Arch) and Reca Jones (University of Louisiana, Monroe) [38] Louisiana Avocationals Louisiana has a tradition of avocational archaeologists making significant contributions in North American archaeology. Dr. Clarence H. Webb's contributions include the Poverty Point culture, the Caddo culture, and the San Patrice culture. He received the Crabtree Award in 1985. Avocational archaeologist Bill Baker recorded over 100 sites in Central Louisiana and contributed to the preservation of significant sites, including Cowpen Slough, Troyville and Caney Mounds. Reca Jones has been an avocational archaeologist since 1960. She has recorded and promoted the preservation of mounds in Northeast Louisiana, particularly in the Ouachita River Valley. She was the first to publish information on Watson Brake, a Middle Archaic mound complex, and has actively protected the site since 1981. Reca served as president of the Louisiana Archaeology and in recognition of her work received the Crabtree Award in 1998. Haws, Jonathan (University of Louisville) [16] Human-environment interaction during the Upper Paleolithic in central Portugal Throughout the Pleistocene climatic shifts repeatedly impacted the Mediterranean region. In response to these perturbations, the Mediterranean bioclimatic zones evolved as some of the most diverse, dynamic and resilient in the world. The appearance of modern humans in western Iberia after 30,000 BP co-occurred with important environmental changes, especially regarding animal communities. This paper combines data from zooarchaeological, paleontological and paleovegetation records to identify patterns in human-environment interaction at different spatial and temporal scales. Evidence suggests that modern humans transformed their environment creating long-term dynamic and resilient socio-natural systems during the Upper Paleolithic.

Past analyses of these components at Caguana in the central highlands of Puerto Rico indicate that the ball court anthropomorphs and zoomorphs reflected an increasing sophistication in the use of religious imagery and rituals by the political elite to further their influence. Rock art from the ball court site of PO29 in the south and those of Viví also in the central highlands offer opportunities to further explore the intersection between religious and political organization in the Late Ceramic period.

Healan, Dan (Tulane University) [221] Obsidian Bifaces Seen from Both Sides In Mesoamerica two different biface industries involving obsidian can be distinguished, one of which involves conventional bifacial thinning and pressure flaking of a nodule or blank, producing symmetrical, thin, and aesthetically pleasing implements. The other features the use of high-angle "edging" confined to the margin that largely shapes rather than thins, whose products exhibit a casual and often seemingly mediocre workmanship although their abundance indicates they were adequate for their purposes. This paper considers contextual and other information that may shed light upon different technological, social, ideological, and other cultural milieu in which the two industries may have operated.

Previous interpretations, based on minimal systematic investigation, assume valley occupation consisted of small populations subjugated under successive Wari, Chimu, and Inca empires. This idea is challenged by recent excavations, architectural studies, and artifact analyses at three sites--Caldera, El Carmen, and Quipico--undertaken to clarify the functions of adobe compounds

suspected to be elite residences and administrative structures, providing a preliminary description of local control within communities throughout these dynamic periods.

What is the Influence of Southwest Archaeology Beyond the Southwest? Southwest archaeology made important contributions to the development of method and theory in the era of the New Archaeology. This paper asks whether, how, and in what subject areas, the importance of Southwest to general archaeological method and theory continues today. Research is based on analyses of articles published and cited in major journals. It considers which theoretical and methodological subjects are being emphasized by Southwest specialists, and whether the influence of those contributions is reaching beyond the Southwest. This in turn suggests trends and advice for what we should be doing. Heilen, Michael (Statistical Research, Inc.) and Jeffrey Altschul

The application of key data quality indicators was illustrated with survey data from four DoD installations. The study recommended that: (1) archaeological data and metadata on survey methods, recording techniques, and instrumentation should be maintained and archived regularly; (2) standard data quality metrics should be used at other installations; and (3) some problems with data quality stem from problems with the site concept.

Heinsch, MF (University of Chicago) [240] Wheel-Finished versus Wheel-Formed: Inferences and Implications from Radiographic Evidence of Ceramic Forming Techniques at Velikent The adoption of wheel-forming techniques in potting communities is typically accompanied by a host of changes in social networks of production. Finding locally produced wheel-turned pottery therefore, holds many implications for site interpretation. While the use of a wheel is often inferred from ceramic characteristics observed in the field, radiographic analysis in the laboratory produces finer distinctions in the application of wheel techniques in pottery production sequences. In the case of Velikent Fine Wares, pottery once identified in the field as wheel-formed was later revealed

Heitman, Carrie (University of Virginia) [128] Learning the Vocabularies of Vernacular Architecture, Chaco Canyon, NM, A.D. 850-1180 The nuanced vernacular of prehistoric architecture has much to tell us about how structures are layered with differential meaning from the moment of construction to the time of abandonment. While traces of these processes often leave complex archaeological signatures, tenth through twelfth century occupations of Chaco Canyon offer an intriguing and discernible case study. This paper evaluates the contexts and content of deposits demonstrating acts of ritual dedication and closure from twelve Chacoan sites and evaluates these deposits at three levels: their distribution across site types, their utility for assessing social inequality, and their meaning as informed by ethnographic analogy.

Most Clovis caches contain a broad range of bifaces, preforms, and points, representing multiple loci on an attritional reduction sequence. The Hogeye cache is composed of a narrow segment of this reduction sequence with near equal numbers of well developed point performs and unfinished Clovis points, lacking only basal grinding. This rare snapshot` is discussed within broader Clovis contexts. Hemmings, C. Andrew [90] see Illingworth, Jeff; [210] see Lohse, Jon C. Henck, Amanda [155] see Lu, Hongliang Henderson, A.

The physical properties of the Lake Amatitlán region would have resonated strongly in Teotihuacano belief, recalling the three hearthstones of creation and the Flower Mountain paradise. This paper considers the impact Maya ideology may have had on Teotihuacano ritual by investigating Lake Amatitlán as a point of multicultural interaction, incorporating pilgrimage, procession, and the reverence accorded particularly sacred landscapes into discussions of Teotihuacán presence in the Guatemalan highlands. Hendon, Julia (Gettysburg College) [260] Social Contexts of Textile Production in Formative Maya Lowlands Textile production in Prehispanic Mesoamerica must be studied indirectly as the fabrics themselves are only rarely preserved. If textiles are fugitive, at least some of the tools used to produce them are more durable. This paper considers the evidence for spinning, weaving, and other fiber arts, such as paper making, in the archaeological record of the Maya Lowlands during the Formative period in order to understand the social context of production. This social context includes the relations and identities that textiles mediate as well as the processes of embodiment that develop from the merger of technology and materials. [65] Discussant

Henecke, Jennifer (Stony Brook University), Jennifer Everhart (Stony Brook University) and Kathryn Twiss (Stony Brook University) [74] Long Bone Cross-Sectional Geometry As a Method for Investigating Ancient Herd Mobility Recent trends in the study of ancient animal husbandry have introduced new methodologies for examining management practices. Our project uses long bone cross-sectional geometry (CSG) to investigate ancient herd mobility. Studies performed on various species have demonstrated that mobility-induced stress alters cortical bone distribution in long bones. Differential distributions, measured using CSG, reflect differential locomotor behaviors. However, muscoskeletal design differs greatly between taxa, and relevant data for caprines are limited. We present CSG data on modern American and British sheep with known life histories as a pilot study for exploring the extent of variation in relation to mobility patterning. Henning, Joachim (Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, Germany) [243] A Small Town Experiences the Fall of the Roman Empire: (1) New Archaeological Strategies and Answers for an Old Question An integrated strategy was developed to explore the archaeology of Tarquimpol with an eye to the great debate about Rome's fall: remote prospection (geomagnetic and GPR), palaeoenvironmental investigation, GIS, exploratory trenches. The results of three campaigns have changed dramatically our picture of the end of empire in eastern Gaul (France). Although the Roman small town and road station of Decempagi was destroyed by fire in the third century and completely leveled, it surged back to life in the later fourth century as a fortified place still situated at the Roman road. It survived essentially as long as the Roman state was able to protect the old order. Its demise sheds important new light on the archaeology and history of communications systems of the late Roman and postRoman period. Henrikson, Lael (Bureau of Land Management) [223] Going with the Flow: The Impact of Holocene Fissure Eruptions on Obsidian Source Use in Southeastern Idaho A chemical analysis of diagnostic projectile points from the Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve in southern Idaho suggests that direct procurement of raw material from local obsidian sources was a long-term pattern in the region. However, significant trends in the frequency of specific sources associated with particular projectile point types were noted in this study. Statistical tests suggest that these trends are linked with atlatl versus bow and arrow technology. Although changes in mobility or population movements could have influenced this pattern of distribution, a more reasonable explanation for fluctuations in the frequency of particular sources suggests that they may be due to barriers created by Holocene lava flows that coincidentally prevented access during specific time periods.

However, calculus may be affected by diagenetic processes, and material adhering to the surface of teeth may not be calculus. We examined modern, recent historic and the Shanidar III Neandertal teeth with an ESEM/EDS to identify the molecular components of enamel, calculus, root and surface particles. Calculus was predominantly calcium phosphate, confirming its biological origins, and unlike the root it showed little chemical alteration. Surface particles were clearly distinguishable from calculus. No microfossils were visible on the surface, confirming that recovered microfossils were from the calculus matrix.

Henry, Edward (University of Mississippi) [36] The Archaeology of the LeBus Circle and Some Comments on the Implications of Large Early Woodland Circular Earthen Enclosures in the Ohio Valley. Circular earthen enclosures constructed throughout the Ohio Valley during the Late-Early and Middle Woodland periods have long been poorly understood. Archaeological research conducted at the LeBus Circle in Bourbon County, Kentucky focused on assessing site integrity through geophysical prospection and excavations. Carbon samples from three contexts across the site were submitted for chronometric dating. Data from the radiocarbon dates and artifact analysis suggest that the LeBus Circle is an Early Woodland earthwork with a Late Fort Ancient occupation. The data from this research is used in a subsequent discussion highlighting the evidence for Early Woodland ritualism in the Ohio Valley.

The archaeological data utilized in this study is from Houses A-B, C, and D of the Southeast Row House and House One of the South Southeast Row House. This study looks at the daily lives of the inhabitants of Fort Michilimackinac, providing insight into how the soldiers and officers functioned and how they may have influenced the activities at other sites.

Archaeological evidence of jewelry, weaving practices, colonial period historical documents, and modern ethnographic information will serve as additional lines of evidence to explore bodily adornment as related to sociality. These considerations will all be interpreted in light of wider spheres of interaction and influence resulting in continuity and change in Oaxacan dress. Hepp, Ivy [260] see Hepp, Guy D.

Hernandez, Hector (Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan) [17] Gendered Labor and Daily Life Economy in Classic Maya Households from Siho, Yucatan, Mexico The excavation and archaeological analysis of two elite maya households at Siho Yucatan, have provided evidence about men´s and women´s daily labor organization during Late and Terminal Classic period (800/850-900/950 AD) in western Yucatan. Gender, as an analytical category, has promoted a reevaluation of the different roles that individuals played in complex past societies. At Siho´s maya households we can find a variety of labors ranging from the so called subsistence activities through a craft production that could relate individuals who occupied the inside as well as the outside household with the entire community. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to discuss the implications of a gender division of labor, the organization of production, and subsistence activities of domestic groups in the daily life economy of the ancient maya community of Siho, Yucatan.

While men have developed individuality gradually, women did not develop individuality until Late Modernity. This fact explains the existence of important differences in both kinds of individual identities. I will refer to them as "dependent individuality" (for men) and "independent individuality" (for women), and I will try to explain their main structural features, points of fragility and contradiction. My aim is to reveal the patriarchal bias that also exists in studies about identity, as when "individuality" is addressed, it usually refers to the kind of dependent individuality developed by men.

The region is characterized by diverse physiographic zone with heavily dissected uplands and late Pleistocene drainages. Analysis of site taphonomy is often complicated by a high frequency of multicomponent sites found in eroded uplands. However, most reported sites in the study area are found along the two forks of the White River Valley, and this alluvial setting presents an intriguing landscape for chronologic controls and paleoenvironmental reconstruction.

For the Columbia Plateau region in latest prehistory, the material record of the Pend Oreille is one such exception. In an otherwise xeric region this watershed has consistently been mesic and lacked anadromous fish due to barriers. Given this, the Pend Oreille's history of human use and occupancy should differ from the balance of the region in archaeologically measurable ways. Recent archaeological investigations are presented that contribute to proxy datasets allowing construction of a more cogent statement about the human experience in the lower Pend Oreille valley.

Hirshman, Amy (West Virginia University) [169] Appraising the Data: Resolving Multiple Inquires into the Nature of the Tarascan Ceramic Pastes Initial visual and low-power binocular inspection of ceramic pastes from archaeological contexts in the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin, Michoacán, Mexico, indicated greater paste diversity than expected. Chemical compositional, petrographic, and refiring analyses have separately evaluated this complexity, with somewhat differing results. This paper provides a synthesis of the current results and assesses the implications of paste composition on our understanding of the organization of ceramic production and distribution in the cultural tradition leading up to and including the Late Postclasssic Tarascan state. [169] First Chair Hirst, K. Kris (Archaeology at About.com) [180] God's Truth and Public Archaeology: Would You Like Syrup with that Waffle? In communicating archaeology to the public, a universally held truth is that you should leave the waffle out, that waffle words like "suggest" and "possible" and "maybe" should be omitted from public resources describing science. The argument is perfectly valid in some media: it makes a far less complicated book if you can get off the fence. After more than a decade of presenting public archaeology on the Internet, and interacting directly with members of the public in numerous ways, I have come to the conclusion that the waffle is where it's at. Science has a card against creationists that we seldom play--that of creativity, possibilities and open-ended questions, and that, I believe, is an effective tool for stimulating both children and adults, and introducing archaeological concepts and the scientific method. Hitchcock, Robert (Michigan State University) [56] From California to the Kalahari: Adaptive Variability and Environmental Management among Mobile and Sedentary Foragers Drawing on lessons from the work of Michael Glassow and his students on the archaeology and history of coastal and island foragers in the Santa Barbara region of California, this paper examines adaptations of mobile and sedentary San foragers in the Kalahari Desert of southern Africa. Like the Chumash, the San peoples of the have had to cope with local and regional environmental variability, sedentism, contacts with non-indigenous populations, and competition for resources. Archaeological, ethnohistoric, and ethnographic data indicate that San foragers employed a variety of environmental management strategies in the face of complex processes of ecological and socioeconomic change.

Hoak, Megan (University of Tennessee) [247] Analysis of the Lithic Materials from Late Prehistoric Through Pre-Clovis Strata at the Topper Site, Allendale County, South Carolina Analysis of the lithic materials from late prehistoric through pre-Clovis strata at the Topper Site, Allendale County, South Carolina was conducted to identify those attributes which distinguish culturally produced material, or artifacts, from those objects produced by natural processes. A comparison of materials found throughout the stratigraphic column is used to evaluate the stratigraphic integrity of the site, and specifically the extent of vertical movement or artifacts in the deposits. Dense Paleoindian through later Holocene age artifacts occur stratigraphically above a much sparser, presumed pre-Clovis artifact assemblage, mixed amid naturally produced lithic debris.

Church is located in Bloomington, Illinois, and is believed to be the oldest African American church still in existence in Illinois. The church was excavated in the summer of 1992 by archaeologists of Illinois State University. The primary questions that I am going to address in this paper are the kind of activities that were carried out at the church; the average economic position of the congregation based on the materials they purchased as a group; and the roles the Wayman A.M.E. Church played in the African American community between 1850 and 1930. Hockett, Bryan (Bureau of Land Management) [16] Nutritional Consequences of Middle Paleolithic Diets on Pregnant Neanderthal Women Across most of Europe Neanderthals evolved socially and physiologically to hunt large terrestrial vertebrates. This interpretation fits early Neanderthal populations throughout Europe, and many later populations as well. Traditional evolutionary ecology models, particularly those relying on cost-benefit analysis that track energy or calories as the prime driving force behind demographic success, would suggest that these Neanderthals should represent the pinnacle of human health and vigor. This paper models the nutritional and physiological consequences of this subsistence strategy, particularly on pregnant Neanderthal women, in order to shed light on why Neanderthals did not survive competition with in-coming populations of AMHS.

The answer to the title question will be explored by examining residues taken from 10 archaeological sites across the GHP. These sites date from the Early Neolithic (when domesticated animal use became visible regionally) to the Late Copper Age, a span of approximately 3000 years. This paper summarizes my dissertation work, showing how animal product use has changed through time, with a specific focus on dairy residues. I will examine dairy use as

part of the larger economic intensification pattern. I suggest that domestication and secondary product use (specifically dairy products) impacted how communities worked economically and socially.

Domestic resources, such as turkey, appear to have declined just before the region was depopulated. These data, along with other lines of evidence, suggest that dietary stress might have played an important role in regional depopulation. To determine whether such stress occurred in other settlements, we examine the faunal assemblage from Goodman Point Pueblo, which is similar in chronology, size, and location to Sand Canyon Pueblo.

Together, the burial assemblages from the sites of Lavoutte, St. Lucia, Anse à la Gourde, Guadeloupe and Kelbey`s Ridge, Saba comprise more than 150 burials. Detailed taphonomical analysis of these assemblages in the field has led to distinguish different steps in the burial ritual and revealed particular mortuary practices reflecting the creation and expression of social identities of the buried populations. The physical remains can be considered as holding material agency emphasizing the role of the deceased community members amongst the living, congruent with themes in Caribbean mythology.

During the distribution of collectively-held land grants after the Mexican Revolution of 1910, cenotes played a crucial role in determining the foundation of new settlements. Taking a longer historical perspective on the social importance of cenotes, this paper will document some of the particular strategies that have been employed by Maya communities to preserve this element of their biocultural heritage.

While interpretations of the ritual importance of these brightly-hued birds are undisputed, the archaeological evidence of their husbandry at Paquimé provides a unique opportunity to place these animals into a specific belief system. In this paper I demonstrate how these birds are closely tied with the symbolic system at Paquimé through a contextual analysis of the bird burials. This symbolic system is where difference and hierarchy are created and maintained, and thus key to understanding any form of prehistoric social organization.

Video and still photography documents that adult elephant limb bone is difficult to break with hammer stones and that the use of an anvil facilitates the process. This research suggests that observed mammoth bone breakage patterns are indications of human technology, because no natural taphonomic process can break fresh cortical mammoth limb bone in these patterns. Mammoth sites with these breakage patterns are therefore diagnostic of human presence. Holen, Steven [210] see Muniz, Mark P.; [190] see Holen, Kathleen A.; [259] see Mandel, Rolfe D.

Indigenous people are often disproportionately affected by climate change related environmental degradation and indigenous voices are necessary to appropriately conceptualize problems for research. The rich contributions of archaeologists to applied historical ecology are made richer by incorporating indigenous perspectives in the development of research and appropriate methodologies.

Holliday, Vance (University of Arizona), David Meltzer (Southern Methodist University) and Todd Surovell (University of Wyoming) [224] Did a Younger Dryas Extraterrestrial Impact Affect Paleoindians (or Even Happen)? An extraterrestrial impact at the onset of the YD (~12.9ka) was hypothesized to explain the end of the Clovis occupation, as evidenced by the lack of post-Clovis-age components at Clovis sites. Yet most later Paleoindian localities also lack immediately succeeding occupations. Where multiple components do occur, stratigraphic hiatuses between them are due to geomorphic processes. Calibrated radiocarbon ages demonstrate continuous occupation across the span of the purported "YD event." A YD impact is an unnecessary 'solution' for an archaeological problem that does not exist. More problematic, purported physical and chemical impact signatures were not reproduced in independent tests.

Eric [171] Conflict and Culture Change on the Plains: The Oneota Example The Oneota tradition was one of the most successful cultural patterns to emerge onto the Great Plains due in large part to war. After first appearing on the prairies and woodland borderlands of the Midwest the Oneota people and cultural practices spread rapidly by various means, including conquest, to dominate the region from central Kansas and Nebraska to central Indiana and from Canada to southern Missouri by AD 1300. Then by AD 1400, Oneota territories retracted to consolidated village complexes strategically positioned along the major rivers and lakes enabling complete control of trade and territory for the next 225 years. European contact dramatically altered the balance of power through the introduction of guns, new diseases, and new political alliances. Holly, Donald (Eastern Illinois University), Christopher Wolff (Arctic Studies Center, Smithsonian Institution) and John Erwin (Provincial Archaeology Office, Government of Newfoundland and Labrador) [60] Interactions and Encounters with the Beothuk in Southeastern Newfoundland Some of the earliest encounters between Europeans and the Beothuk Indians took place in Southeastern Newfoundland. These early encounters, most famously documented by John Guy in the early seventeenth century, suggest that relations between the Beothuk and Europeans were initially amicable, and that the prospects for further trade were good. However, such relations soon soured, and the Beothuk eventually retreated from this area to points north and west. This paper examines this process as it is evident in the archaeological record of the region, and discusses preliminary results from our excavations at a late prehistoric/early Beothuk site in Trinity Bay.

Despite this clear material richness, however, the Chiriquí area was archaeologically interpreted to be materially poor through much 20th century academic literature.

Holmes, Charles [27] see Potter, Ben A. Holstad, Emily (Washington State University) and John Jones (Washington State University) [84] Cooking With Limestone: Does it Enhance Maize Nutrition? It has long been known that processing maize with lime enhances the availability of nutrients such as lysine in human diets. Basketmaker II groups on Cedar Mesa were heavily dependent on maize, and did not have beans as a complementary protein source. Their habitation site middens typically have numerous chunks of limestone. It is hypothesized that in the absence of pottery, Basketmaker II groups used limestone in stone-boiling maize-based meals, and that this enhanced the nutritive value of the maize. This paper reports the results of experiments that investigate this hypothesis by stoneboiling maize with limestone versus other stone types as heating elements.

[53] A Great Conflagration on the Sea Discovered by Micro-Sampling and a Portable XRF Perhaps, as those who champion micro-histories and micro-sampling contend, we do miss a great deal of the macro when we overlook the micro. Surface and excavation investigations of a shipwreck in Ghana gave no indication of what must have been an intense fire aboard the vessel, but evidence in the form of melted metals and other materials recovered in sediment cores (through micro-sampling) tell another story. Use of a portable XRF analyzer verified the elemental components of the burned artifacts, confirming the blaze.

Some of commonly excavated wild food plants from East Asian Neolithic sites require complex processing procedures for making them edible, and thus well-organized working systems for them must have existed.

The approach used to create classification systems for these items often resembles that applied to chipped stone tool typologies. Yet, the guidelines for GST classifications are more diverse than those applied within the framework of lithic studies. GST represent long-term investment in production and are heavily curated.

Perspectives from North Dakota on the Attribution of Caches In recent years a handful of new caches has been discovered and attributed to Clovis, and not always for obvious reasons. As the range of cache artifact variability expands, it is important to assess how caches can be assigned to Clovis, particularly in the absence of Clovis fluted points. This is also true in an age where skilled knappers can replicate Clovis artifacts and package them as caches. Based on our experience analyzing the Beach (North Dakota) and other caches, we offer suggestions for technological signatures on artifacts that should permit more objective assessment of how to attribute caches to Clovis.

Hung, Ling-yu (Washington University) and Jianfeng Cui (Peking University) [175] Investigating Majiayao Painted Pottery Production with LA-ICPAES Painted pottery vessels represent a dominant type of craft specialization among the Majiayao communities living in the upper Yellow River region, ca. 5,300­4,000 BP. However, with regard to the social and economic dimension of pottery production, we know almost nothing more than that Majiayao painted pottery was made by specialized craftspeople. A critical issue still left to us to investigate is how the increasing demand for vessel quantity was fulfilled in terms of production. Based on visual observation and chemical analysis, this paper provides new evidence to discuss changes in the production of Majiayao painted pottery in late Neolithic northwestern China.

Hung, Ling-yu [189] see Liu, Haiwang Hunt, Terry (University of Hawai'i) [206] Late and Rapid Colonization of East Polynesia Archaeological and palaeoenvironmental field research in the farflung islands of East Polynesia has confirmed a late chronology of colonization over a nearly simultaneous time-frame. The late and rapid settlement of East Polynesia denotes high population growth rates, great mobility, and opportunistic subsistence strategies. Shorter chronologies raise implications for direct and indirect ecological impacts, human competition, demographic transitions, and other evolutionary dynamics.

While often assigned functions as weights for fishnets or as thrown objects used to catch waterfowl, little in the way of empirical evidence has been generated to explain their form and features relative to performance in prehistoric behavior. Here, we provide an analysis of the variability in shape and surface finishing of plummets as a means for studying the technology of their manufacture and performance constraints inherent to their use.

In this paper we examine regional demography and local settlement histories after AD 1130. We use data from our test excavations at several sites along Mule Creek, a well-known obsidian source, to track the scale and timing of Kayenta and Salado migrations and explore the size and cultural affiliation(s) of Postclassic occupations. We also employ a large obsidian source database to explore connections within and among Salado and contemporaneous groups. Huntley, Deborah L.

Hurcombe, Linda [256] Recognising and Valuing Skill in Perishable Material Culture Though our world is full of organic material culture, the skills of manufacture in prehistoric artefacts of these materials may not be apparent to a modern audience. This is partly due to biases in evaluating craft items and partly due to a lack of familiarity with the exploitation patterns and production techniques necessary to make the object. Ethnographic and experimental evidence will be used to elucidate some of the ways in which skill-level could be read and archaeological case studies will be used to show how cultural values can be realigned to factor in sophistication in perishable material culture items.

Adair-Steadman was an important stopping point for Folsom huntergatherers to replenish their stone tool kit. From the local gravels along the Clear Fork of the Brazos River in Texas, Folsom flintknappers spent considerable time and effort in making projectile points, bifaces,

and unifaces attested by numerous failed preforms, bifaces, and debitage. Curtis Tunnell`s analysis of lithic material from Adair Steadman helped to discover the Folsom projectile point production sequence. Currently, Folsom manufacturing strategies for gearing up have been examined. The results presented provide an important glimpse into Folsom technological organization in relationship to Paleoindian landscape use on the Southern Plains. Hurst, Winston [160] The Spider Woman`s Matrix: Ancient Puebloan "Roads" in Utah as Integrative Monumental Features Constructed linear swales ["roads"] have been widely identified in association with ancient Puebloan sites on the Colorado Plateau, including the Utah portion of the northern San Juan region. Although the study of Utah`s ancient roads is in its early stages, extant data are sufficient to suggest that the roads and associated features were important elements of an integrated cultural landscape of natural and monumentally constructed features. These man-made lines in the land physically linked places of importance to the local Pueblo communities, simultaneously expressing and reinforcing culturally important ties among communities and significant features of the natural landscape.

Maguey fiber production occurred extensively across the site throughout its occupation.

Hutchinson, Robert (University at Albany, SUNY) [20] The Sociopolitical Structure of Mayapán: An Analysis of the City`s Burial Patterns During the Late Postclassic Period Mayapán was the preeminent economic and political power within northern Yucatán, Mexico. Ethnohistoric sources indicate that this city was governed by a coalition of lineages that unequally shared power (a multepal), and that these kin-based identity groups maintained a presence within Mayapán`s wall. Alternately, scholars have proposed a more centralized governmental structure supported by a politically unifying elite cult that crosscut corporate group membership. By comparative analyses of burial patterns within and without Mayapán`s Ceremonial Center this paper addresses each of these models. These analyses suggest that a segmentary sociopolitical structure is indicated. Hutira, Johna (Northland Research, Inc) [50] Monica and Bill! Ross and Rachel! OJ and Nicole!

Hutson, Scott and Miguel Covarrubias (Proyecto Ah Kin Chel) [109] Causeways in Context: Settlement Dynamics of the UcíCansahcab Sacbe, Yucatan Northern Yucatan contains several intersite causeway systems. These causeways--also called sacbes--represent close relations among the sites they connect. However, systematic surveys along the lengths of these sacbes are rare. An 18 km long causeway connects the sites of Ucí and Cansahcab. The Ucí-Cansahcab Sacbe Archaeology Project has mapped Ucí, surveyed an 8 km by 0.5 km transect following the causeway, and documented newly discovered archaeological sites not connected by the causeway. These data help understand the political, social, economic, and ritual transformations that both resulted in and resulted from the construction of the causeway.

Terminological Obscurity in the Field of Fiber Artifact Studies Although as archaeologists we tacitly acknowledge that every classification system carries with it a theoretical stance, we rarely, if ever, question the terms we use to describe and label our finds, which inform our classification methods. We do not wonder whether the terms we use are imbued with theory or even mean something we do not intend them to mean. Within the realm of perishables studies cordage analyses reveal consistent conceptual problems. In an example drawn from the nautical arts, a close re-reading of the concept of cordage informed by an analysis of myth reveals hidden levels of cultural meaning.

I explore patterns of abandonment, reuse, and intrusion at monumental centers focusing on their place within local landscapes. Different types of sites, originally built and occupied during the first millennium BC, appear to have been imbued with a multitude of meanings which played an active role in guiding local practices of intrusiveness.

Excavations at Aguateca and Ceibal revealed evidence of burning at the time of abandonment. At Aguateca, elite structures were burned along with numerous objects left behind at the end of the Late Classic period. At Ceibal, the royal palace of the Terminal Classic period was emptied and then burned. Excavations results from these sites provide important information on the Maya practice of burning and its relation to political change and abandonment.

First associated with the Acheulian, they were subsequently found in Middle Paleolithic contexts, leading to speculations of filiation or convergence. In this paper, we explore the relationship between Acheulian and Mousterian handaxes by first examining their historical research context and then tackling the differences from a morphometric point of view. We demonstrate that there is a discontinuity in the presence of handaxes from the LP to the late MP, and that the two kinds of handaxes are subject to different treatments during use and discard.

Among the Aztecs, the mountain cult was closely connected to the cult of meteorological phenomena, water and the earth, and both the ritual tools and the entities and events perceived in the sky or in the surrounding landscape were regarded as objects of agency and carriers of tonalli. The ritual places themselves were charged with agency, because their design was made to provide an appropriate scheme for making these ceremonies effective. This, in turn, required the detailed knowledge of the physical world, interpreted in terms of relationships between gods, destinies and ritual acts. The paper discusses the symbolic as well spatial relationship between the sites and the landscape, and gives a special attention to the visibility and inter-relationship between the ritual sites and specific landforms.

Meat and other animal products were a part of the flow of commodities that supported the elite and their activities. Zooarchaeological studies of Mississippian assemblages from sites in the Mid-South demonstrate that no single animal resource distinguishes elite from non-elite diets or meals. Rather, unique combinations of resources and rare items, often imbued with inferred symbolic significance, offer clues as to how animal resources articulated with the complex social setting of Mississippian culture.

An ostensibly secondary center, Say Kah displays architectural, ceramic, and mortuary trappings of substantial elite resources, suggesting a need to examine assumptions about status and influence based on settlement hierarchies. The ceramic record provides a useful way to compare sites in the region and assess the meaning of variability in ceramic assemblages in relationship to site function and identity of its occupants.

Recent research into the Formative Lake Titicaca Basin demonstrates that at any time, there were numerous co-existing centers that anchored far-reaching interaction networks. All known centers served as sites of ritual practice, and as such anchored the overlapping religious ideologies and social identities of extensive communities. Focusing on Khonkho Waknane, I argue that the constructed environments of some centers concentrated power by way of spatial, material, and semiotic references to powerful landscape features and the various living and immanent beings considered to inhabit them. Through potent ceremonial events, these centers sought to create persons with specific ritual attitudes.

Taking a lead from some philosophical work in geomorphology and biology, I suggest ways in which general models can become localized accounts of contingent cultural phenomenon, and suggest limits on this process. Jeffra, Caroline (University of Exeter) [256] Clumsy, Crude, Well-Made, Fine? Skill and the Learning Process In Light of the Pottery Wheel Studies involving Minoan Crete have repeatedly expressed assumptions regarding the relationship between skillfulness and material culture, particularly in ceramics. The earliest use of the pottery wheel focuses this attention, exemplified by the classification of some ceramics as "crude wares". This classification obscures the pottery wheel as a key marker of skills renegotiation. Reevaluating the wheel highlights the changing skills of potters, in terms of

individuals and communities of practice. The application of experimental archaeology and the chaîne opératoire approach can disentangle the resulting questions of skill, production speed and the learning process without imposing hierarchical values on types of pottery. Jelinek, Lauren (University of Arizona) [144] Revisiting San Cayetano de Calabazas While the Pimería Alta is dotted with a variety of Spanish colonial installations, smaller sites are often overlooked by researchers and the general public. One such example is San Cayetano de Calabazas, a former Spanish visita that is part of the Tumacácori National Historical Park. A reanalysis of historical and archaeological data from this site has demonstrated that, although it is not as architecturally stunning as other Spanish missions in the region, it possesses a richer history. It was occupied intermittently from the protohistoric period to the early twentieth century and can be seen as a microcosm of Arizona history.

This paper summarizes recent Middle Horizon research in Arequipa and demonstrates how this new research has transformed our understanding of what happened in the region during this period. Instead of being incorporated into the Wari Empire via established Wari centers like Cerro Baul and Pikillacta, Arequipa seems to have been first incorporated into the Wari sphere via the region`s longstanding connections to the Nasca region. Wari influence, and with it increased social change and interregional interaction, reached the highlands of Arequipa only in the second half of the period.

A Comparison of Clovis and Folsom Lithic Technological Organization on the Plains and Plains Periphery The high-tech forager model (Kelly and Todd 1988) was proposed to generally explain the technological, subsistence, and settlement strategies of Early Paleoindian (Clovis and Folsom) hunter-gatherers. The subsequent 20 years of archaeological research has illustrated the complexities of these Early Paleoindian lithic technologies. In this paper we directly compare Clovis and Folsom technological organization on the Plains and Plains periphery to assess the relative position of each along the collector-forager continuum. Jensen, Anne (UIC Science LLC) [79] Before Birnirk/Thule: Ipiutak and Others in the Barrow Area The Barrow area is well-know for the Birnirk and later winter villages and settlements found there, many of which are quite important in the history of Arctic archaeology. Far less attention has been paid to other types of sites, including those which predate the Birnirk/Thule period. The recent startling discovery of an Ipiutak occupation at Nuvuk, Point Barrow, makes it timely to compile and review the current information on such occupations, much of which is scattered in grey literature, with a view toward guiding future research on this earlier period.

Horse procurement reflects a very long tradition in Eurasia, 450,000 years in Germany, France and England, a tradition that is suspected to have played an important part in the early settlement of the New World. This paper will attempt to compare some horse procurement and butchering strategies of Eurasia with those of America, particularly what is referred to as butchered horse teeth.` New evidence suggests that a search of old collections, particularly the collections of several Great Basin locations held by Universities and Museums compared to collections at the British Museum and Museum of Natural History, London, will prove enlightening.

Most syntheses of Wisconsin prehistory rely heavily on cross-dating or analogy with nearby regions for placing local ceramic technologies into a chronological framework. We present more than120 AMS dates from organic residues adhering to ceramics from Wisconsin sites--many from well-known ceramic types or from prominent archaeological sites--to provide a preliminary chronology for the Woodland period in the region, and provide suggestions for more detailed theoretical and methodological inquiries in the future.

Anyang Palaces were the royal residences as well as the seats of political and religious activities. Excavations at Huanbei, a walled urban center dating to the 13th century B.C., has revealed the largest palace/temple compound ever discovered in Bronze Age China, offering an opportunity to examine the nature of palaces and temples in early complex societies. This paper describes orthogonal physical layouts, the spaces with public or restricted access, architectural elements of the palace buildings. The palace/temple compound is discussed in the contexts of evolving cultural tradition and political ideology to understand how palaces served to embody and legitimize the power of ruling elites in the functioning of the Shang state.

Here we present archaeological evidence from mortuary contexts in Central Asia to critically discuss how identities manifest materially in different ways. The emphasis is on how multiple identities are discernable simultaneously and how identity in the past is intrinsically linked to identities and categories in the present.

Over the years, many artifacts have lost their accession numbers, have been misplaced, and have changed storage locations. Consequently, it is not uncommon to uncover an unmarked Jesuit ring in a drawer, a rim sherd in a file cabinet, or a stone tool in a random box. As times have changed, curational standards have also evolved. As a result, WMU, like many other institutions, is in a curation crisis. As stewards of the past, our goal is to preserve these artifacts in perpetutity. It is vital that we insure the best care is taken to preserve archaeological context. The goal of my research is to develop a holistic inventory system and bring WMU's archaeological

Although urbanism in small-scale societies has been well documented, we suggest that 1) issues of scale have often been over-looked and 2) more recent conceptual models such as community may be useful in assessing urbanism in small-scale societies. Based on data collected during pedestrian survey and limited test excavations from the summer of 2009 in the Chelyabinsk Oblast in southern Russia, we suggest that the Middle Bronze Age cultural phenomenon of Sintashta and the related Country of Towns can contribute productively to modeling how small-scale societies undergo diachronic processes of social cohesion and breakdown associated with early forms of urbanism.

While the artifacts from our excavations have not been fully analyzed yet, their ubiquitous presence indicates that Early Modern deposits need to be recognized as a valuable comparative resource within Icelandic archaeology.

While mainland Southeast

Asian kingdoms often solved the problem of agricultural support through intensifying wet rice production, island Southeast Asian polities emphasized a strategy of slave-raiding, trade, and labor redistribution within less intensive systems of farming.

Questions regarding the relationship between biology and culture, a central theme of anthropological research, arise from scrutiny of this transition. Archaeological analysis suggests that a cultural diffusion from regional centers like Cahokia to peripheral areas took place at the Mississippian Emergence (technology, subsistence strategies, mortuary practice, etc.).

This paper discusses the potential of web-based data-sharing systems for improving access, reuse and transparency of ground stone data. Discussion centers on Open Context, a web-based system serving the diverse needs of the archaeological subdisciplines. We discuss the implications to ground stone research of data publication, community input and linking to print publications.

Kardulias, Paul (College of Wooster) [78] A Holistic Archaeology: Cross-Cultural Research and WorldSystems Analysis As Binford demonstrated almost fifty years ago, the construction of viable analogies by which to interpret the material record requires judicious use of cross-cultural comparisons. World-systems analysis (WSA) offers a sound framework within which to explore inter-societal connections and to evaluate the validity of drawing on ethnographic data to understand prehistory. Such a structure provides robust interpretations by linking study of the past and present through principles that characterize humanity through time and over space. Using examples from North American and European ethnographies, in this study I emphasize negotiation as the mechanism by which

individuals interact with social structure. Kasper, Kimberly (University of MassachusettsAmherst) and Kevin McBride (University of Connecticut-Storrs) [117] The Spatial Significance of Plants Archaeological plant remains are rarely evaluated within a spatial framework to reconstruct social-cultural dynamics. This paper demonstrates that plants are valuable, in conjunction with other ecological and cultural data, to gain insight into domestic spaces within a community. A GIS analysis of plant remains recovered from thirteen Historic sites (1675-1930), in conjunction with documentary and paleoecological data, at the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation in Connecticut, documents the changes and continuities of plant strategies. This spatial investigation facilitates an understanding of complexities of households and the variability of decision making of Native Americans within the Reservation system.

Over six hundred tools as well as substantial amounts of debitage recovered from plowzone and feature contexts. The material has been classified using recording scheme developed for Upper Mississippian sites in northern Illinois. Tools from feature context show continuity in the lithic assemblage among the site's components and are compared to similar material from other late prehistoric and protohistoric sites in the Midwest. Kaufmann, Kira [70] Sleuthing Soils: Interpreting Cultural Behavior from Geophysical Data of Effigy Mound Construction in Southeast Wisconsin Recent geophysical survey and syntheses of previous data from Effigy Mound sites reveals patterns of construction that inform about cultural behavior during the Late Woodland period. Although similar in physical expression on the landscape, different construction techniques of these effigy mounds have been identified. Patterns seen in the surface shapes of Effigy mounds at these sites may express a shared cultural identity through the visual effect created by construction of the landscape. Whereas, internal construction differences may imply greater diversity in the social organization of the groups who built the mounds or that different groups were utilizing the same locations.

Clovis points and other chipped stone artifacts are identified to central Mississippi Valley and immediately adjacent sources that seem to be distinct from those of Clovis and/or Gainey sites to the east of the valley. Mastodon is one of several taxa recovered. The focus of Clovis predation at Kimmswick was not exclusively on big game. More likely is a pattern of broad spectrum foraging in which physiologically stressed mastodon was but one target of opportunity about a small pond or possibly a salt spring.

To accomplish this we propose an integrated, multi-site strategy. Central to this approach is the development of a tool kit of practical ethnobotanical, zooarchaeological, and/or sclerchronological methodologies to determine season of occupation. A cornerstone of the research plan is applying these methods to botanical and shell samples from sites of all sizes and types across the region, which will require collaboration from many archaeologists.

During the 2006-2009 field seasons, late Quaternary floodplain vertisols at the site yielded a chronologically ordered sequence of artifacts from late prehistoric to Paleoindian (Folsom, Clovis and potential Pre-Clovis). A comparison of debitage and artifact size categories, diagnostic point distribution, calcium carbonate presence, vertic crack maps and OSL dates with depth is used to determine the extent of post-depositional movement of archaeological materials at the site as well as help define the mixing properties of weakly vertic sediments. Kehoe, Alice (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) [15] Cahokia in the Early Postclassic American World Cahokia, like Chaco, precisely fits the Mesoamerican Postclassic time period, AD 1050-1250. Cahokia --like Mesoamerican cities but unlike Chaco-- is constructed on a rectilinear urban grid with pyramidal mounds around plazas. It most closely resembles its contemporary, Cholula. Cahokia is without precedent and is never replicated in Anglo America, whereas the cities of Mesoamerica offer ample precedents and later examples. Given the time correlation and city form, the most parsimonious historical interpretation is that Cahokians modeled their city on a Mesoamerican ideal ("Tollan") and the collapse of the Early Postclassic Mesoamerican political economy brought down Cahokia, too.

On the unrelenting sands of the DTC/C-AMA, recruits lived on canned rations and limited water while they were relentlessly attacked from land and air. Although the camps of the DTC/C-AMA are amply documented, the actual maneuver areas are little explored.

Recent tomb excavations at the site of Tenahaha in the Cotahuasi Valley suggests that the inhabitants participated in the wider social changes occurring during this period, including the development of sociopolitical complexity, without direct Wari influence. Preliminary stable isotope analysis of human bone collagen suggests differential individual access to food resources.

As a result, I found that the Tiwanaku polity formed colonies in strategic locations and established vertical trade and alliances. Additionally, Charazani locals emulated Tiwanaku style and ideology. In comparison, the Inka Empire created vertical trade and alliances, but not colonies. Instead, the Inka constructed various architectural features and granted a privileged status to the locals, which reinforced Inka political control in Charazani.

While rural settlements near the larger centers of El Cafetal and El Paraíso exhibit the same broad distinctions in site planning, construction styles, and material culture seen at each (local patterns at El Cafetal and Copan Maya patterns at El Paraíso) they are far less pronounced in the rural settlements, suggesting that engagement with these diacritics was significantly different for rural residents.

[68] New Linguistic Evidence for Polynesian Contacts Since identification four years ago of three words in two southern California Native languages that suggest prehistoric contact with Polynesia, additional information has started to accumulate from both North and South America. In this paper I will discuss three new findings: (1) a word for "sewn-plank canoe" from the western Patagonian language, Alakaluf; (2) an intriguing set of words for "harpoon" or "spear point" from around the southern Pacific basin (North and South America, and Polynesia); (3) the Quechua word walpa (meaning chicken). The latter is especially important in light of the recent identification of pre-Columbian Polynesian chicken remains in South America. Klassen, Sarah (Dartmouth College) [204] El Antigual: A Test of Surface Collection Methods This poster reports on a research project designed to determine the usefulness of survey data in representing the full occupational sequence and the kinds of activities undertaken at El Antigual, Roatán Island, Honduras. Preliminary surface survey suggests that the site dates to the Late Postclassic period (ca. AD 1200-1519). This idea was tested by comparing ceramics from surface survey against those from subsurface deposits at the site. The research also considers how past and future development on the island has acted to obscure the integrity of surface and subsurface deposits and therefore condition our understanding of chronology on the island. Klehm, Carla (University of Texas at Austin), Borbola Nyiri [149] Countering Centralization and Specialization in the Benta Valley: Ceramic Production, Use, and the (In)Visibility of Hierarchy During the Bronze Age, the Benta Valley region increasingly participates in long-distance trade, diversifying its subsistence and technological base as the population expands and aggregates. Although emerging fortified centers control specialization in some economic aspects, localized production, use, and exchange of ceramics provide a counter-case. Rather than centralized specialization, multiple ceramic specialists, broadly spread throughout the valley and not controlled by the hierarchical settlements, confront or at least mitigate these social divisions by emphasizing cultural commonality. Interestingly, social inequality remains indirectly indexed through the socioeconomic behaviors and relationships associated with the everyday ceramic use, which will also be explored.

Given the environmental setting and occupational time period of the site, the lithic data exemplifies important characteristics indicative of the commonalities and variability of early Mississippian culture. What can the Alexander Jacob site tell us about this cultural variability? A comparison of contemporaneous sites within the Greater American Bottom attempts to relate the lithic data recovered to site specific conditions, while exploring changing cultural patterns at the beginning of the Mississippian period.

significant changes which go beyond the introduction of metal. It will be stressed that the essence of transformation in this period is social and economic and also includes visible changes in the settlement pattern. The majority of known Neolithic settlements were abandoned and the new settlements formed new agglomerations with significantly different characters. Ones of them was located in a vicinity of the older Neolithic occupation while the other was placed in a completely new area. A reason of location of the latter cluster remains unknown and its nature have not yet been investigated. Previously dominant life in larger clustered neighborhood communities had lost their meaning. More autonomous household and the increased competition over resources would have led to a functionally different system and organization of settlement. Hence, the question arises to what extent broken bonds of the Neolithic identity/tradition contributed to cultural, social, economic, and ideological syncretism of early farming communities in the Early Chalcolithic?

Past excavations revealed many interesting cultural aspects about these fortifications, including different construction techniques and layouts, as well as the presence of various artifacts. Recent work focused on gathering data from all fortifications in the area to create site typologies and classification systems for all forts. This will help us better understand all the sites and can aid in identifying different occupation periods or reconstruction phases which could be attributed to culture, or possibly warfare.

[50] Discussant Kobti, Ziad (University of Windsor) and Denton Cockburn (University of Windsor) [19] Village Functional Specialization Framework The Pueblo did not all perform the same tasks as not everyone had access to the same productive resources. Some resorted to potterymaking, trading these goods for sustenance goods such as maize or meat. Two of the primary methods of exchange were kin-based and trust based. We explore the concept of agent functional specialization. Agents determine how to allocate their time between necessary tasks, with more than just their family's needs to take into account. We extend the trading system in our current model to allow agents to trade these surplus goods for other goods. Koenig, Charles [22] see Johnson, Angela K. Koerner, Shannon (University of Tennessee) [228] Mississippian Frontiers in the Highlands of Southern Appalachia Excavations in Tuckaleechee Cove, bordering the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, provide evidence of Native American settlement in the Southern Appalachian highlands. Pottery studies from Late Prehistoric assemblages indicate long periods of interaction among culturally-distinct peoples from the eastern Tennessee Valley and the highlands of North Carolina. Although the Cove was used for millennia before ca. AD 1300, its use lessened after this time and evidence of Tennessee Valley material culture disappears. A sustained investment in the Cove by more eastern groups after ca. AD 1300 may stem from cultural differences in the use of highland resources.

The proposed research asks whether Mesoamerican goods, iconography and ideology were imported and/or emulated by Medio period peoples, or whether migrants took up residence in the Casas Grandes region.

This type of facility, which is spatially separated from domestic residences, has been rarely documented in Mesoamerica. The structure was fully excavated and the lithic debris was studied with mass and individual flake analysis techniques.

Large volumes of valley fill are too young to host such deposits. However, some key suitable landscapes of appropriate age are preserved. These include former shorelines of backflooded tributary valley lakes; outwash terraces (exposed and buried); and, colluvial slopes and eolian deposits on the aforementioned surfaces.

In this paper, Kimmswick and Modoc are placed within a regional context by briefly summarizing recent investigations at a series of early sites in adjacent sections of the Middle Mississippi Valley and interior uplands. Lithic data from these sites demonstrate that, while Dalton mobility patterns are strikingly different from those of Clovis, they are strikingly similar to those of Early Archaic groups.

This paper presents recent excavation data from houses in the heartland of the Inka Empire (Cusco, Perú) in order to examine how sacred power was manifested within domestic settings. Diachronic analysis of excavated objects and offerings from Inka households reveals how dramatic ceremonial practices coincided with moments of historical transition and sociopolitical crisis. In these moments of crisis, we see how claims to sacred power are tied to politicized renderings of ontology.

Kradin, Nikolay (Russian Academy of Sciences) [78] A Macroscoic View Anthropological constants bear directly upon the outcome of cross cultural archaeology. Large scale cross-cultural research in anthropology has revealed important constants that archaeologists need to consider.

The object of this paper is to explore how these constants affect archaeological cross-cultural analysis. Kramer, Karen (Harvard University) [119] Lewis Binford`s Interdisciplinary Reach: Deepening the Dialogue between Ethnography, and Human Behavioral and Biological Variability Lewis Binford not only fundamentally changed how we think about the archaeological record, but also substantially influenced anthropological approaches to human behavior. In highlighting the importance of ecology to human variation and challenging traditional perspectives on ethnographic analogy, Binford resituated the relevance of forager populations to address new evolutionary questions. In my research among foragers and other traditional populations, this inspired the perspective that humans are interesting because of their breadth of facultative responses not only behaviorally, but also biologically. Rather than focusing on norms of human behavior, biology and demography, Lew taught us how to learn from variation.

Previous 'bulk' studies using human tooth enamel from this and neighboring sites focused on d13C variability as a product of both 'total' diet and the canopy effect, while d18O values represented broad scale, climate-related trends. Serially sampling enamel along growth layers offers new perspectives of diet and environmental change and permits key questions to be addressed such as the ecological context associated with new modes of food production.

The soil characteristics, distribution of arable land, and the potential to improve productive potential speaks to the self-sufficiency of Perry Mesa residents during the 13th and 14th centuries. In addition, extensive agave utilization and access to a diversity of wild resources would have buffered inter- and intra-annual agricultural shortfalls.

Galway, Ireland Despite its importance, our understanding of the Early Medieval period (roughly the 5th through 9th century) western Ireland has lagged behind well-established research and scholarly discussions of Christianity`s history in continental Europe. Archaeological survey of remote islands along northwestern Connemara in 2008-9 provides a new opportunity to further define the temporal and cultural affiliations of the spread of Christianity through western Ireland. Our survey documented several previously undocumented early Christian settlement sites and cemeteries, offering a tantalizing opportunity to rewrite our understandings of late Iron Age and early Christian period along coastal Ireland.

In this area after A.D. 1450, there were three exogenous sources of change not accounted for in the model: the arrival of Athabaskan peoples into the northern Southwest; the entry of Spanish explorers; and the imposition of Spanish colonial rule. Each of these external forces had the potential to divert Pueblo fertility, mortality and identity from their indigenous historical trajectories.

Recent fieldwork focused on a shallowly buried Folsom component located in the eastern portion of the site. Spatial analysis of the eroding lithic scatter reveals clusters of tools, flakes, and burned bone and lithics. The artifact distribution is argued to represent hide processing and retooling activity areas located adjacent to a small bison kill, adding another important element to the already complex story of the Lindenmeier site.

Fires leave physical evidence of their cause and origin. The application of modern fire protection engineering principles to the archaeological record can assist in determining the cause of ancient fires. Laluk, Nicholas (White Mountain Apache Tribe - U of A) [228] Apache Place-Making in the Chiricahua Mountains of Southeastern Arizona Due to the ephemeral nature of historical-period Apache archaeology in the U.S. Southwest much is still to be learned about Apachean lifeways, especially those pertaining to the social processes that underlie various responses to increased Euroamerican interaction.

Material consequences resulting from these interactions are subtle but nonetheless represent a range of social processes, from subsistence to preservation of traditional lifeways. Through the investigation of high altitude Apache sites in Southeastern Arizona utilizing inter-Apache tribal collaborative interpretation of the material record, a better understanding of social investment strategies that underpin decision-making practices and their landscape associations may be highlighted. LaMotta, Vincent (University of Illinois at Chicago) [128] Patterned Cultural Deposition Associated with Postoccupational Histories of Architectural Spaces at Homol`ovi Excavations within architectural spaces in the fourteenth-century Homol`ovi villages of northern Arizona have revealed stratigraphically complex and seemingly purposeful cultural deposits in terminal- and post-occupational contexts--on top of the final occupation surface and features of a room, or within its postoccupational fill. Repetitious patterning across contexts and villages indicates common elements to the behaviors involved. This presentation explores variation in the structure, context, and chronology of such deposits at Homol`ovi, and draws on historical sources and general principles of space use to begin building method and theory for discerning the purposes behind, and social units responsible for, their construction. Lamuela-Raventos, Rosa (UB), Cristina Andres- Lacueva (UB), Olga Jaúregui (SCT-UB), Rosa Guasch [55] Chemicl Analysis of Old Egyptian Wine Residues Ancient Egyptian wine residues were analyzed to verify and characterize the residue inside the amphorae. Owing to special characteristics of these samples, dryness and the small quantity available for analysis, it was necessary to have a very sensitive and highly specific analytical method By LC/MS/MS to detect tartaric acid at trace levels in the residues. Moreover, alkaline fusion was carried out in the deposit residue of dark color to identify syringic acid derived from malvidin as a red wine marker. Malvidin glycoside, the main anthocyanin that gives young wines their red color, polymerizes with aging into more stable pigments.

Landeros, Juan (CSULA) and Eden Chavez (California State University, Los Angeles) [148] Concepts Related to Human Sacrifice in Contemporary Zapotec Ethnography The sudden and mysterious death of a young man in Southern California set off a heated discussion within the Zapotec community over the cause of death. The discussion underscored a widely held belief that a jealous Earth required a human offering for the successful completion of large scale community construction projects. The victim is chosen by the community council and the death accomplished through witchcraft. Caves are frequently said to be involved in the many varieties of this type of sorcery. Our findings shed light on this poorly documented aspect of cave ritual.

The purpose of the excavations was to illuminate temporal and spatial relationships between archaeological sites in the region through lithic, ceramic, faunal, paleoethnobotanical, and other analyses. Paleoethnobotanical samples from each of the sites were analyzed in the Paleoethnobotany Lab at Washington University in St. Louis to improve understanding of diet and seasonality within the greater cultural context of the area.

The fort, which survived for eighteen months, was burned to the ground in 1568. Using zooarchaeological data from recent excavations at the fort and adjacent village, known collectively as the Berry site, this paper investigates Spanish subsistence practices to further explore the intercultural relationships that developed between the soldiers and their native neighbors.

The most significant discovery during the excavations, were a dozen shell mounds. These mounds are found along a river that flows to the Pacific Ocean. The location of La Flor aided its preColumbian inhabitants in the procurement and dispersal of shells for the potential purpose of trade along the Gran Nicoya Peninsula and possibly farther.

That Two Moon Shelter was occupied during the fluted point horizon is unquestionable, however, the nature of that use is unclear. Does the 10+ cm thick component represent one or multiple occupations? What was the nature of that occupation or those occupations? To begin unraveling the Two Moon deposit, fine scale excavation techniques make possible the examination of vertical artifact and eboulis frequencies, backplots, positional data, and thin sectioning of the excavated area to provide preliminary answers to these and other questions.

The remains of three and possibly four separate burial grounds, a leacht, several monuments, a mill pound, a monastic cashel and clochan ­ along with ethnographic evidence for an enduring cult of St. Leo ­ suggest not only that the Early Christian occupation was more extensive and complex than heretofore recognized, but also that its material remains continued to play a crucial role in island life throughout the following centuries.

Lassen, Robert (University of Tennessee) [210] Caches and Their Implications for Clovis in the Southeast The lack of Clovis caches in the southeastern United States poses a unique problem for Paleoindian archaeology. Two explanations for caching have been proposed by Collins and Meltzer, and both have implications for the Clovis habitation of the Southeast. From Collins` theory, one can draw the conclusion that the landscape of the Southeast was relatively unknown to people from the Clovis period. On the other hand, Meltzer`s theory would imply that people from the Clovis period would have been comparatively more established in the Southeast. Both scenarios are compared to recent models tracing settlement patterns during the Clovis period. Lattanzi, Gregory (New Jersey State Museum) [59] The First Stimulus Package: The WPA and the New Jersey Indian Site Survey Between 1936 and 1941 the Indian Site Survey, a Works Projects Administration relief program, identified numerous sites and conducted archaeological investigations throughout the state of New Jersey. These excavations were sponsored by the New Jersey State Museum and directed by Dr. Dorothy Cross. This massive project, not only identified hundreds of amazing sites, but also excavated one of the most significant prehistoric settlements in the Middle Atlantic region - the Abbott Farm National Historic Landmark. This paper looks at the Indian Site Survey program and how it provided a more comprehensive picture of New Jersey's prehistoric past.

imperial expansion, trade interaction surged during the early Middle Horizon, followed by new exchange patterns and stylistic emulation. Direct Wari control seems unlikely, but Wari keyed in on resources of the Callejón de Huaylas and the adjoining Cordillera Negra, while apparently avoiding east of the Cordillera Blanca. Current data suggest that religion and prestige economies were the principal factors for intensified interaction. Laumbach, Karl (Human Systems Research, Inc.) and Toni Laumbach (New Mexico Farm and Ranch Heritage Museum) [192] Post Mimbres Relationships on the Cañada Alamosa Frontier Located west of the Rio Grande in southwestern New Mexico, the Cañada Alamosa is the extreme northeastern corner of Mimbres affiliated pueblos. Research on the Cañada Alamosa has revealed that the post-Mimbres world was a time of integration and assimilation with long time northern pueblo neighbors. Integration was followed by aggregation of small sites into one community, a pattern repeated across west central New Mexico at the beginning of the 13th century. During the 13th century new migrants from the north settle near the aggregated community, possibly creating tension that ultimately encouraged the abandonment of the canyon by Mimbres descendents.

Prehistoric Warfare has been a topic of great interest in the recent past. Questions arose if there was evidence of war before European contact, or if in fact the Indigenous tribes were the peaceful, innocent children as thought by the clergy. This paper looks at a specific region along the Missouri River in central South Dakota and south central North Dakota. This area is known as the middle Missouri. Archaeological evidence has shown that there were "earth works" that closely resembled fortification ditches of the old world. This lead archaeologist to question if in fact there was pre-contact warfare on

the Great Plains. This paper addresses environmental factors that may lead to war, it also address social factors that may lead to war. This paper looks at the research on why people go to war and applies to this geographical area. Finally this paper looks archaeological evidence and historical evidence and concludes that in fact there was warfare occurring on the Great Plains prior to contact with the European hoards. LeBlanc, Steven (Harvard University) and Michele Morgan (Peabody Museum, Harvard University) [235] Intraindividual Seasonal Variation in Basketmaker II Diet Revealed by Stable Carbon and Nitrogen Isotope Analyses of Human Hair It is now generally agreed that Basketmaker II populations of the northern American Southwest obtained significant calories from corn. To date this interpretation has reflected an average overall assessment of diet. Using the innovative technique of multiple sampling along individual strands of human hair, we provide stable isotope evidence for considerable intraindividual seasonal variation in both eastern and western Basketmaker II diet over the annual procurement cycle. We report hair keratin stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data from 30 individuals from three Basketmaker sites, Kinboko Cave and White Dog Cave in Arizona, and South Cave in Falls Creek, Colorado.

In Sanak Island assemblages Steller sea lion and walrus were of particular difficulty. As Steller sea lion and walrus feed on very different food sources we conducted analysis of the d13C and d15N of these questionable elements in order to help in the identification of these species. Not only were we successful but we were also able to determine intraspecies feeding habits that differentiated through time. Analysis of carbon and nitrogen values should aid in the taxonomic identification of indeterminate specimens the future. Leclerc, Mathieu (Université de Montréal) and Adrian Burke [60] Chert Distribution among Saint Lawrence Iroquoians sites in southern Quebec: A Glance through X-rays Goggles Several potential sources of Appalachian cherts found on archaeological sites throughout Northeastern North America have been identified to date. Unfortunately, these cherts greatly resemble each other, both microscopically and macroscopically, making it unproductive to distinguish them using petrography and necessitating a regional database of geochemical signatures for each chert source. In this presentation, signatures obtained from prehistoric quarries are compared to Saint-Lawrence Iroquoians artefacts, providing a new understanding of late prehistoric raw material procurement, distribution, and exchange patterns in Southern Quebec. Results show that the visual identification routinely executed by archaeologists can often be misleading. Lee, David (Southern Methodist University) and Stanley Guenter (Southern Methodist University) [77] Ballgame Panels from El Perú-Waka` in Regional Perspective Carved stone stair blocks unearthed at Waka`s main palace depict scenes of the ballgame.

Examining the incidence of these scenes from other Maya sites, the authors consider the social and political context of these representations. In initial creation and later reuse, these panels served as markers of political power, legitimacy, and alliance; they perhaps also represent ritual interactions with ancestors and the

At the turn of the century, these lots contained two separate dwellings, which exhibited disparate patterns of housing. One lot contained a single-family home that had been consistently occupied by one family, while the other lot contained a tenement building that had been occupied by a variety of families and individuals. The findings from this investigation illuminate the realities of life in urban St. Louis households at the turn of the century.

Recent research along the North Fork of the Mokelumne River indicates permanent year round settlements nestled in river valleys and canyons cut through the high Sierra. Using central place foraging theory I conclude that acorns were processed where they are consumed. Using quantitative methods and GIS to compare mortar depth, elevation, site type, and dominant vegetation, a pattern emerges which indicates that acorn processing is almost exclusively conducted at larger sites which represent year round villages.

This expedition seeks to locate inundated geographic features and archaeological sites. A GIS predictive model was constructed to establish prime locations for future research among the several hundred targets previously identified during survey. This model integrates submerged geophysical data with known cultural and environmental variables to examine the likelihood of human habitation and archaeological recovery. Given the logistical expense of underwater archaeology, the ability of this model to narrow research areas in an informed manner highlights its methodological significance. Lemmen, Carsten (GKSS-Forschungszentrum Geesthacht) [61] Intercomparison of European and North American Regional Transitions to Farming in a Mathematical Model of Sociotechnological Adaptation The introduction of agriculture into Europe and Northern America required space provided by cutting forests. The regional trajectories of technology, subsistence base and demography characterizing this cultural and morphological---also climate-relevant---transition are hindcasted with a numerical model for simulating global land use and technology evolution; within this framework, hypotheses about the different timing of the regional transitions to agriculture and intercontinental lags are tested: I assess the explanatory power of bioclimatic factors, such as biogeography and (abrupt) climate changes, as well as of cultural factors, like the influence of nearby founder regions and the importance of migration and trade.

Ongoing research in the US Midcontinent has focused on collecting samples from independently dated archaeological features such as fired mound floors, earth ovens and hearths in order to refine the existing archaeomagnetic dating curve for this region. New samples have been recovered from sites in Illinois and Tennessee and help to strengthen the curve between roughly AD 800 and 1400.

America. This resulted from the lack of a native population to submit to a mission system, as well as the need for economic selfsufficiency. In managing these enterprises missionaries operated within the guides of their spiritual ideals and restrictive laws prohibiting excessive profit-making.

Lensink, Stephen and Joseph A. Tiffany [72] Dating the Origins of the Central Plains Tradition This paper proposes a new chronology for the Nebraska Phase of the Central Plains Tradition. Recalibration of radiocarbon dates coupled with cross dating of Nebraska phase materials from well-understood sequences elsewhere--Oneota sites; Cahokia; and Steed-Kisker settlements--leads to a proposed revision of the Nebraska phase occupation span of A.D. 1250­1400. The ceramic evidence includes (1) the absence or near absence of Initial variant ceramics in Nebraska phase assemblages and visa versa, (2) complete absence of Stirling phase Ramey vessels in the Nebraska phase, and (3) low numbers of seed jars and bowls post-dating the Stirling phase.

Levin, Maureece (University of Oregon) [74] Breadfruit Storage Pits in Pohnpei, Micronesia: Construction and Use Breadfruit, an important crop throughout much of the Pacific Islands, is often fermented and stored in pits. On the island of Pohnpei in eastern Micronesia, this practice, which played a key role in the prehistoric and historic prestige economy, has taken place since at least 400 AD. This poster presents the results of the 2008 excavation of a breadfruit storage pit and compares layout and soil profiles to other archaeological breadfruit storage pits on the island. The soil profiles of the pits indicate the way in which the pits were constructed. Differentials in design may point to varying functions, e.g. communal pits vs. small family pits, changes throughout time, and regional variation on the island. This information aids in understanding prehistoric arboriculture systems and food storage on Pohnpei.

Lewis, Mike [217] see Kozuch, Laura Lewis, Quentin (University of Massachusetts, Amherst) [117] Unequal Variables: GIS and Spatialities of Inequality In this paper, I explore the possibilities of using GIS to study spatialities of inequality. Much GIS usage in archaeology typically focuses on modeling environmental variables and presuming equal access to strategic resources, but the ethnographic and historical records are filled with fragmented and bifurcated spatialities, and archaeological sites resulting from these cultural processes may not conform to expected variables. Using examples from 18th and 19th century New England, I outline some potential variables and processes to suggest further research into spatialities of inequality, and advocate for more socially conscious Geographic Information Systems.

Libbon, Jonathan (Indiana University of Pennsylvania) [233] Geophysical Investigations Along the Allegheny Portage Railroad The Staple Bend Tunnel was a key link in the 394 mile Portage Railroad that connected Pittsburgh to Philadelphia in the early 19th century. Through the use of geophysical methods it is possible to determine lost elements of the Portage Railroad. In this project I used ground penetrating radar to investigate previously identified anomalies by the western portal, along with, newly identified structures in the vicinity. Ground truthing was used to test the anomalies identified, as well as determine if they represent cultural or natural features. Liebmann, Matt (Harvard University) [1] The Archaeology of Apostasy and Counterfactual History This paper presents the results of a long-term investigation of a relatively understudied phenomenon in archaeology, revitalization movements. Conducted in collaboration with the Pueblo of Jemez between 2001-2009, this research project set out to examine the archaeology of the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 in northern New Mexico, probing the material expressions of nativism and nativism. The results raise various theoretical and methodological questions regarding how archaeologists deal with causality and historical contingency. In an attempt to address these issues, this paper explores the viability of counterfactual reasoning in archaeological interpretation.

My paper focuses on the guards of the largest repository of archaeological patrimony in Portugal, the Museu Nacional de Arqueologia, between the museum`s foundation in 1893 and 1929, when its first director, Dr. Leite de Vasconcellos, retired. Archival research reveals that museum guards played a surprisingly active role in excavations in this early period of Portuguese archaeology, despite the fact that they were rigorously disciplined in their behaviors.

This work is a byproduct of the supervision of seismic surveys undertaken by PEMEX (Mexican Petroleum Company). We have intensively surveyed more than 1,300 square Kilometers, in a region where almost no previous systematic surveys have been undertaken. We have registered over 350 archaeological sites, made numerous surface collections, and constructed detailed maps of formal architecture.

Threshing Machine Canyon was the site of significant activity throughout the 19th Century. Many visitors carved names and dates into the canyon`s limestone walls. Reconnaissance survey and recordation was completed in 1994. Over the past 15 years the Bureau of Reclamation has noted vandalism, removal, and erosion of the inscriptions and glyphs. Reclamation is using LiDAR technology to create highly detailed 3-dimensional imagery of the inscriptions and glyphs to document their condition at a very fine scale, and pinpoint those panels that need intervention and treatment to retard erosion or reduce vandalism. Lincoln-Babb, Lorrie (BIOARCH, L. L. C.) and Chris R. Loendorf (Gila River Indian Community) [158] Ritualistic Mortuary Performances During the Late Archaic in the Southwest: There's No Place Like Home Patterns in mortuary performances occur among Late Archaic or preceramic sites within the Greater Southwest. Common attributes of these rituals include interment locations, offering types, grave construction, and body position. Evidence also suggests families may have been interred in the same location. Head orientation variability is suggestive of belief differences from later prehistoric populations. Data from Archaic period sites in central and southern Arizona, west Texas, and Northern Mexico are presented. The consistent nature of funeral rituals across this area is suggestive of a widely held mortuary system that emphasized kinship and may have played a role in land tenure. Lindeman, Michael (Desert Archaeology), Gary Huckleberry, and Henry Wallace [44] The Martinez Hill to A-Mountain Irrigation Community The identification of Hohokam canals in the Santa Cruz River floodplain suggests the possibility that villages in the Tucson Basin may have been integrated into social and economic groups based, at least in part, on the construction and maintenance of irrigation canals and the attendant sharing of water for agriculture. Four Hohokam villages are known along the Martinez Hill to A-Mountain reach of the Santa Cruz. Canals beginning at Martinez Hill would have watered the floodplain shared by the villages. The system to manage irrigation would have encompassed all of the settlements, transcending traditional village boundaries.

The discussion will focus mainly on the work done on Mound A, the most severely deteriorated earthen structure on the site, detailing the initial consultation with Cahokia, Kinkaid, NPS and USDA to the final repair work that eventually removed Angel Site from the dreaded list. Lindsay, Ian (Purdue University) [175] Holding Down the Fort: Magnetic Survey in the Investigation of Political Dynamics at a Late Bronze Age Fortress Settlement, Tsaghkahovit, Armenia Geophysical archaeology is gaining popularity in the US as researchers increasingly find advantages in efficient, non-destructive means of investigating ancient human behavior. In the Caucasus, where the social dynamics of nomadic groups have long been debated, magnetic-gradiometry is proving an invaluable aid to identifying thin deposits from short-term occupations that often escape detection by traditional archaeological reconnaissance. This paper discusses a magnetic survey at a LBA fortress in Armenia, revealing for the first time the spatial organization and surprisingly ephemeral nature of LBA domestic architecture and forcing us to rethink how sedentary fortress elites exercised their authority over mobile subjects.

Lipe, William (Washington State University), Donna Glowacki (University of Notre Dame) and Thomas Windes (University Of New Mexico) [84] Dynamics of 13th Century Depopulation of the Northern San Juan: The View from Cedar Mesa Chronological evidence from across the Northern San Juan culture area reveals spatial and temporal patterns of population growth and decline in the 13th century A.D. Depopulation proceeded roughly from west to east, with areas such as Cedar Mesa declining while parts of the Central Mesa Verde area continued to grow. This is consistent with the seriation results described by Curewitz and Matson. These spatio-temporal population trends are discussed in relation to environmental change, warfare, aggregation, and the socio-cultural restructuring of Central Mesa Verde communities.

With luminescence dating, we are able segregate the earliest pottery from later sherds allowing us to examine to examine introduction of the technology, providing greater detail on the types of pots that were initially made and the functions they served. Using luminescence dates from multiple assemblages across the deserts of California and cultural transmission models that account for the diffusion of innovations in prehistoric settings, we explore how material technologies are transmitted across time and space within smallscale hunting and gathering groups.

Lippert, Dorothy (National Museum of Natural History) [7] Memory and Longing in the Practice of Repatriation Native people, like many persons of color, are identified as having culture in ways that the non-colorful don`t. This seems to have created a longing on the part of anthropologists to possess, and benefit from proximity to, Native culture. Objects and human remains present in collections serve as souvenirs of non-Native control over cultured peoples. Resistance to repatriation reveals a sense of nostalgia for the pre-NAGPRA era when the (good) Indians participated in archaeology only as sources of data. This is actually an Imperialist Nostalgia, resulting in the passage of repatriation laws that have irrevocably changed the discipline.

The data generated over the last 12 years has enabled us to evaluate the development of complex societies over 6000 years of prehistory in this region, including changing subsistence strategies and the processes of state formation. Our current research questions are related to the transition from mobile hunting-gathering society to sedentary villages, and preliminary results from residue and usewear analyses have provide much insights to these issues.

Lizarralde, Marina (Washington University in Saint Louis) and Lee Arco (Washington University in Saint Louis) [26] Analysis of the Tetrahedron Deposit at Jaketown The 1951 excavations at Jaketown discovered a dense deposit at the base of Mound A composed of fragmented and intact pyramidshaped fired-earthen objects associated with the site`s Early Woodland component. Few examples of these tetrahedrons exist in the Lower Mississippi Valley archaeological record. Recent fieldwork at Jaketown in 2009 encountered this tetrahedron deposit and identified a fire pit feature filled with the objects in a distinct behavioral context.

depth of 130 cm below surface (cmbs). All postmolds were located with the first 50 cmbs. Radiocarbon dates indicate that the nearsurface features date to the Late Woodland, while the lower features date to the Late Archaic. The relative dearth of artifacts associated with the pit and hearth features is noteworthy and may be the result of alluvial scouring. Based on the artifact assemblage, including archeobotanical and zoo-archeological remains, Site 12FR336 appears to represent a series of short-term seasonal occupations, some of which may have been ceremonial in nature.

High-powered microwear provides an avenue to circumvent the poor organic record and gain insights into soft technology and adaptations of Late Pleistocene hunter-gatherers.

This question, whether or not Clovis diet was specialized, obscures the role of specialization in making possible the pursuit and exploitation of large herbivores. Using metric and technological data from Clovis caches, this paper advances a model for embedded specialization as an economic or craft undertaking that describes how some Clovis toolkits were manufactured.

Ethnohistorical accounts show that elites owned all land while commoners were landless, but were allowed to work small parcels of a noble`s estate and in return paid tribute in produce and service. Because agriculture depended on rainfall water, and may have been affected by volatile climatic conditions, productivity was probably low having few possibilities for surplus generation. This work explores the alternative economic strategies taken by commoners to buffer risk and agricultural failure, including reciprocity and intermittent or parttime craft production.

Using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry we analyzed the fluted point along with Ramah chert quarry samples, and a suite of other fine-grained quartzites found in northeastern North American archaeological assemblages. The acquisition of Ramah chert by paleoindians from Vermont would have necessitated a round-trip journey of 3000 miles along a recently deglaciated coastline further supporting an interpretation that some northeastern paleoindian groups had perfected an Inuit-like arctic maritime adaptation.

The western Baikal region, our research area, consists of a mosaic of forest-steppe, boreal, alpine, littoral, and marine-like environments. One of the most intriguing features of its Middle Holocene archaeology is a gap and biocultural discontinuity in the region`s mortuary record 6-7000 years ago. This transition appears to co-occur with a period of significant climate and environmental change. These sets of changes are examined here from the perspective of human subsistence patters based on recent research on the region`s zooarchaeological record.

Unlike some regions to the south and west, human colonization of the NEM roughly coincides with, rather than predates, the onset of the YD. Archaeological data show no evidence of a cultural break or population decline at the start of the YD, but rather, ongoing adaptation to changing environments of the NEM during and after colonization. Provenience of sites and isolated point finds suggests Paleoindians did not occupy the northernmost reaches of the NEM until roughly midway through the YD.

Louderback, Lisbeth (University of Washington) [118] Development of Grinding Stone Technology in the Great Basin The intense use of small seeds was a crucial turning point in human dietary history. Around 8,000 years ago, the Great Basin went through its own version of a "broad spectrum revolution", one that included technological change and small seed processing. O`Connell et al. (1982) have predicted that widespread aridity resulted in reductions of high-ranked foods and the adoption of small seeds in the diet. This hypothesis was tested by examining the development of grinding stone technology. I analyzed ages and abundances of stones in three regions of the Great Basin, comparing them to patterns in the paleoenvironmental record. Loughlin, Michael (University of Kentucky)

[254] The Classic Period in the El Mesón Area of the Eastern Lower Papaloapan Basin During the Early Classic period, settlements in the El Mesón area of the Eastern Lower Papaloapan Basin broke from Tres Zapotes` political control. This shift was accompanied by a boom in population and the establishment of new civic-ceremonial complexes. In this paper I examine this change, placing particular emphasis on shifts in the local settlement pattern and political and economic organization. I argue that with the decline of Tres Zapotes, the location of the El Mesón area, within an important trade corridor, provided an opportunity for local political leaders to establish the area as an independent political and economic entity.

Other experiments using green kernels, whole wet hominy, and meal indicate it is the mobilization of carbon from maize and C3 resources that determines d13C values; maize can be under- or overrepresented in d13C values based on the form cooked. Ethnographic evidence demonstrates that dried maize kernels were commonly processed with alkali to create hominy. Here we present the results of d13C determinations on whole kernel maize cooked with alkali, and compare these results against those for other forms of maize. Lowe, Kelsey [217] see Mehta, Jayur M.

Lozada, Maria (University of Chicago) [188] Mortuary Landscapes in the Vitor Valley of Southern Peru The location and structure of cemeteries represent key means by which to understand the social structure and/or ideological perceptions regarding death and life in past societies. Human occupation in the Vitor Valley stretches over 4000 years, spanning the Formative Period until the modern era, allowing archaeologists to interpret how mortuary behavior adapted over time to various cultural, physical and socio-political changes. We explore the relationship between residential areas and cemeteries diachronically from the Ramadas Tradition (Formative) to the modern period. We argue that mortuary practices remained remarkably uniform over time despite dramatic changes in the cultural and physical landscape.

Lucas, Steve (Nez Perce National Forest) [43] Cultural Resource Management Along the Salmon River - Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness Nearly 40 years have elapsed since the first and last significant effort to document cultural properties along Idaho`s Salmon River, within the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. The archaeologically rich corridor represents the longest un-dammed river system in the Inland Northwestern United States. The Nez Perce National Forest, in cooperation with Rain Shadow Research, Inc., have spent the last five years recording and monitoring numerous sites situated along 30 miles of the "River of No Return," in addition to surveying hundreds of acres within this remote, and federally designated wilderness area of central Idaho. Lucero, Lisa (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) [153] Climate Change and Classic Maya Political Decisions Setting in motion the events that led to the disappearance of Classic Maya kings by the A.D. 900`s in the southern Maya lowlands was a long-term drought. Maya kings implemented short-term tactics that only exacerbated problems. These political decisions ultimately resulted in people abandoning rulers and centers because of the lack of water due to the drying up of massive reservoirs. If rulers had employed long-term solutions, would they have been enough to prevent their demise? This question is crucial in view of current concerns on climate change and similar short-term political decisions.

In Guatemala the projects described here were planned from the beginning on a regional scale with creation of locally controlled parks, intercommunity collaboration, education, and indigenous empowerment as principal, not secondary goals. The battle with political and racist obstacles was won, but the reluctance of archaeologists themselves remains. Yet the success of these projects demonstrates that such research designs are a moral imperative in Maya archaeology. Luke, Christina (Boston University) [65] Smart Power and Cultural Diplomacy in Honduras: Heritage and People-to-People Exchanges The intersection of foreign affairs and cultural diplomacy represents an increasing important arm of smart power, the merging of hard and soft power in U.S. foreign policy. Much of the rhetoric associated with U.S. diplomacy in Honduras places heritage at the center of people-to-people exchanges, the programming meant to promote mutual understanding across national boundaries ai med at winning hearts and minds. How such programming plays -out is dictated by the official governmental management of heritage, increasingly a material-focused heritage. Archaeologists balance the spheres of upper-echelon governmentality, long-term local community networks, and sustainable development projects within the mosaic of U.S.

Lukowski, Susan (Washington State University) and Colin Grier (Washington State University) [203] Investigating Patterns of Resource Consumption in a Northwest Coast Plankhouse Household archaeology attempts to understand how households were ordered and how the house itself structures activities. Excavations in House 2 at the Dionisio Point site in the Southern Gulf Islands of British Columbia, Canada, produced a large set of artifacts and fauna. The artifact assemblage reflecting production activities has been analyzed previously. Here, faunal data within the house are examined spatially and quantitatively, revealing patterns of differential consumption of various faunal taxa. Comparison of production and consumption assemblages provides a basis for drawing inferences regarding the nature of cooperation, ownership, and status within a plankhouse. Luksha, Victoria (Graduate Student, University of Montana) [163] Artifact Conservation: A Cost-Effective, Mildly Invasive Method The information recovered from organic artifacts is greatly reduced every hour it is exposed to the air. Traditional active conservation methods have saved many artifacts by using modern chemical additives or resins. These approaches are widely accepted and supported. It is important to consider the invasive nature of these compounds and the cost in storing, using, and disposing of these chemicals. This is a preliminary study involving methods and materials that are cost-effective and using common materials like paraffin to attain better preservation while saving the basic structure of the artifact for later molecular testing.

The site is characterized by a burial area, seven residential mounds, and a main village area and plaza. Field notes, maps, and photographs from the 1930s provided the basis for reconstructing site excavations, while artifacts were analyzed for temporal affiliation. Ceramic analysis and comparison to nearby sites indicate that the primary occupation was probably after A.D. 1000, though earlier components are also present. Lupo, Karen D. [53] see Safi, Kristin N.

Lurie, Rochelle [102] First Organizer; [102] Second Chair [102] see Katz, Steven A. Lusteck, Robert (Rhodes College) [55] Small Things Forgotten: Recovery of Phytoliths from Food Residues One of the benefits of working with phytoliths is their resistance to alteration by curation. Unlike chemical residues, phytoliths are not damaged by time, or altered by glues or storage methods. As long as pot sherds are not assiduously scrubbed, food residues that accumulate on the inside surfaces of ceramics are likely to remain in place and provide enough material for phytolith analysis. Phytoliths also can be derived from archaeological reference samples, like charred corn cupules or cobs. In this paper, I discuss the value of phytolith research on prehistoric maize specimens from the central and southeastern U.S. Luzzadder-Beach, Sheryl (George Mason University) and Timothy Beach (Georgetown University) [91] Wetlands Agricultural Research We have now completed two decades of wetland studies in Blue Creek and Programme for Belize. In this time we have applied multiple paleoecological and geoarchaeological methods to understand wetland morphology, formation, physical and biological properties, functions, evolution, and human use. The last decade of research has focused on the human use potential, through excavations and mapping in the wetlands of Blue Creek and PfB. Herein we summarize the progress and findings of this research involving over forty excavations, and the most recent results of the 2009 field season, and their implications for interpreting other wetland sites across Northern Belize. Lycett, Mark (University of Chicago) [255] Discussant Lycett, Stephen (University of Kent) [205] Stone Tools and Hominin Dispersal: A Cladistic Analysis of Acheulean Handaxes Based on broad dating patterns, it has been suggested that the appearance of Acheulean handaxe technologies outside of Africa was the result of hominin dispersals, yet independent tests of this hypothesis remain rare. Here, this hypothesis is tested using an intercontinental dataset of Acheulean handaxes and a biological phylogenetic method (maximum parsimony). The analyses produce a cladogram consistent with phylogeographic predictions derived from the African Acheulean dispersal hypothesis. Moreover, a bootstrap analysis provides evidence that this pattern is statistically robust, and the maximum parsimony tree is also shown to be significantly different from a tree constrained by stone raw materials. Lyman, R.

Recent analysis of these elk remains reveals a skeletally mature individual with no evidence of butchering but clear indications of carnivore gnawing. The elk had two types of pathologies, and was of a size only slightly larger than some modern elk. The elk is about 9500 C14 years old. [207] First Chair Lynch, Elizabeth (University of Wyoming) [117] Bedrocks Metates along the Chaquaqua Drainage: Building an

Conceptual Framework for Prehistoric Landscape Knowledge The canyons and tributaries of the Purgatoire River in Southeastern Colorado reveal evidence of continuous occupation of indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Evidence abounds for habitation by plains hunter gatherers, horticulturalists and possibly ancestral woodland culture groups. A unique feature of this regional system is the presence of bedrock metates occurring in varied site contexts. This paper addresses the problem of how prehistoric peoples in this region may have incorporated bedrock metates within their sociocultural view of the landscape by through the use of Photogrammetry and GIS to explore the regional typology and distribution of these features. Lynch, Joshua [99] see Morton, Shawn G.

A.D. We use the relative percentage of local vs. non-local raw materials and of high quality chert as measures of lithic procurement strategies, and thus indirectly mobility. Comparing these values against earlier (Archaic) and later (Pueblo) occupations across the Formative boundary, we find that like pueblo period patterns, Dunlap-Salazar occupants used high percentages of local materials and limited quantities of chert. However, preliminary results suggest that the chert abundance may decrease over the course of the site`s occupation, suggesting shifting patterns over time. Lynott, Mark (National Park Service) [176] Ditches, Walls, Mounds and Monuments: What Do We Really Know About Ohio Hopewell Earthen Enclosures? For two centuries scholars have hypothesized about the purpose of the numerous prehistoric geometric earthen enclosure sites in southern Ohio. In recent decades, archaeologists have begun to examine the chronology and methods of construction associated with these great earthen monuments. Geophysical and geoarchaeological studies provide new data that offer more refined interpretations about these unique earthen monuments. Assumptions about the potential contemporaneity of various sites, and the role that borrow pits, ditches and surface scraping may have played in wall construction may need to be reconsidered.

Viewed through the prism of cultural ecology these data provide measurable and rational expectations for the cultural uses of the watershed. Most striking is the intersection between place name and historic cover type data that jointly indicate a higher density of winter village packing than is typically expected and a near equal weighting of cover types selected for optimal winter encampment selection. These anecdotal data can be argued to serve as a proxy for cultural adaptation to a mesic forest environment.

[76] First Organizer Lytle, Whitney (Texas State University) and Kent Reilly (Texas State University) [260] Wrapped in the Clothing of the Sacred Rulership in Mesoamerica was publicly legitimized through elaborate ritual activity. Archaeological, and iconographic investigations have produced convincing evidence that certain stone monuments carrying elite imagery were often wrapped or bundled when not actively in ritual use. A close investigation of several Olmec monuments, that depict elite individuals, reveals that the concept of the sacred bundle was incorporated into their elite costuming. Items of elite dress were conceived of as framing devices associated with maize symbolism. These symbolic expressions identified the wearers as both sacred themselves, and as conduits through which that sacredness could be manifested in ritual space. Mabry, Jonathan (Tucson Historic Preservation Office) [44] Paleoclimatic and Environmental Contexts for Early Agriculture and Water Control in the Desert Borderlands, Southwestern U.S. and Northwestern Mexico Following a middle Holocene population decline in the desert borderlands, the earliest radiocarbon-dated Middle Archaic occupations in the region coincide with the onset of a relatively wet interval at the beginning of the late Holocene, which created favorable conditions for both foragers and the first farmers in the region. The Middle Archaic population increase, the arrival and spread of maize, and the local development of water control techniques are discussed in the context of this wet interval that may have been due to intensification of ENSO cycles, and a related increase in the frequency and magnitudes of winter Pacific storms.

An experiment was carried out which linked directionality on pots with the laterality of the potter in an open system. These results were then compared with data from archaeological pots from sites in the Point of Pines area, Arizona (AZ W:10:50). Analyses of ceramic structure and design were used to extrapolate artistic tolerance with degrees of variation within and between types. Machicek, Michelle [189] see Johannesson, Erik G.

Although it has been recognized that a range of stemmed point forms are commonly present on Paiján sites, this variability is generally subsumed within a single Paiján type. Recent analysis of 161 points from the lower Jequetepeque Valley suggests that the Paiján type actually consists of several distinct forms with different and overlapping temporal relationships. These types correspond to Early and Late phases within the Paiján complex and are indicative of changing technology and mobility strategies.

Here we will describe the settlement patterns of this densely settled urban site focusing on the characteristics, composition, and variability of residential groups to illustrate how so many people lived here and may have experienced the urban environment. Chunchumil`s residential groups with a patio group layout and enclosed by stone boundary walls, which housed the city`s basic social units, provide us with rich details of domestic life. Mahar, Ginessa (American Museum of Natural History) and Elliot Blair (UC Berkeley) [154] Diet, Gender, and Colonialism: The Impact of the Spanish Mission System on Patterns of Consumption in the Coastal Southeast Two important archaeological observations have been made regarding colonial impacts on Native foodways during the Spanish Mission period (1587-1763) in La Florida: paleoethnobotanical and bioarchaeological data indicate a significant increase in the consumption of maize by Indians within the Mission system, while zooarchaeological data indicate considerable continuity in diets from the precontact era. In this paper we re-examine this evidence of change and continuity in colonial diets in Spanish Florida from the perspective of gender, particularly examining the dietary stable isotope data from the region that suggests that the colonial system may have affected and transformed gendered patterns of consumption.

Mahar, Ginessa [154] see Mahar, Ginessa J. Mahoney, Maureen [106] Political Differentiation in Denmark during the Roman Iron Age Beginning ca. 300 BC, the Free German society in Denmark experienced increased political differentiation. At roughly the same time, the Free Germans constructed new types of settlements and began trading with the Romans. While I doubt that these three phenomena were unrelated, it is unclear whether the Romans caused the Free German chieftains. In this paper, I determine the proximity of the new type of settlement to the imported Roman goods that are in graves or bogs. According to my analysis, the Romans had contact with the Free Germans, but they did not cause the construction of the Free Germans` highly stratified society.

As a research method, the "chaîne opératoire" approach seems consistent with, and complementary to an evolutionary perspective which emphasizes both ecological and behavioral aspects of technology, and takes into account the social and political foundations of technological practices. It also offers a way to link specific crafts to the technologies of which they are part.

Malville, John (University of Colorado) and Nancy Malville (University of Colorado) [89] The High Communities of Chimney Rock: Ceremony, Trade, and Astronomy Chimney Rock is unique among Chacoan outliers because it was not reoccupied after abandonment around AD 1130. Both indigenous and Chacoan communities are clearly represented in the archaeological record. Our hypothesis is that the High Mesa community was a ritual and trade center prior to the AD 1076 Chaco intrusion and that the local community accepted Chacoans and willingly shared the sacred space of the upper mesa. Trade of meat products may have alerted Chacoans to the lunar standstills that appeared between the chimneys. Pre-Chacoan ceremonialism is indicated by the fire pit on the upper mesa as well as by the large number of locally-made feather holders. Malville, Nancy [89] see Malville, John McKim Manahan, T.

[114] Intrusions: Incidental or Indicative Cultural Phenomena? From issues of cultural heritage and taphonomy, to how and why sites are abandoned and reused, intrusiveness pervades archaeological practice. This paper introduces the concept of intrusiveness as it relates to archaeology. Archaeologists have come to see intrusive phenomena less as irksome, destructive events, and more as a potentially informative form of cultural activity that may provide insights into the use, abandonment, and reuse of cultural landscapes over long periods of time. Prehistoric and historic case studies from the lower Mississippi and Andean regions will be explored with the objective of further theorizing intrusiveness and defining its heuristic value. [114] First Chair [114] Second Organizer Manne, Tiina (University of Arizona) and Nuno Bicho (FCHS, Universidade do Algarve, Portugal) [16] Never Too Much of a Good Thing: Continuation of Subsistence Patterns during the Upper Paleolithic in southwestern Portugal 25, 000 years ago in southwestern Portugal, humans were exploiting a wide variety of terrestrial and marine resources in addition to intensively processing large game for their bone grease. The Upper Paleolithic site of Vale Boi, located near to the most southwesterly point of continental Europe, indicates that these patterns, beginning in the Gravettian, continued largely in the same fashion throughout the Solutrean and into the Magdalenian. Though no increasing trend of diversification or intensification can be discerned, the exploitation of small, fast-moving game, along with the labor-intensive processing of large game, may suggest behavioral efforts to alleviate resource stress. [16] First Organizer, [16] First Chair Mannheim, Bruce (University of Michigan) and Guilermo Salas Carreño (University of Michigan) [18] Understanding the Andean Sacred: A Dozen Principles Scholars commonly make two moves in interpreting the Inka sacred: (1) they assume that the ritual practices of state elites are coterminous with ritual practices more broadly; and (2) they assume that ritual practices can best be understood by constructing an analogue theology (or cosmology)--a logically integrated set of beliefs--despite the absence in Inka and modern Quechua societies of theological institutions. We propose instead a set of principles through which Inka and modern Andean practices of the sacred can be better understood through a bottoms up, non-cosmological approach. These principles can be tested archaeologically, historically, and ethnographically. Mans, Jimmy (Leiden University) [47] The Contemporary Archaeology of Trio Movements Over the last decade a group of Trio living in the larger village of Kwamarasamutu in the south of Suriname has been fissioning into small villages along the uninhabited middle Corentyne. This process is accompanied by renegotiating ties and identities. The material dimensions of one of these small villages are studied. Its inhabitants and their fluid connections with the material village are subsequently historicised within the time span of a century. The archaeoethnographic stasis of place on the one hand and the anthropological and ethnohistorical contextualisation of the villagers on the other broach Trio dynamics from a multi-scalar perspective. Manzanilla, Linda (U Nacional Autonoma de Mexico) [96] Craft Activity and Administrative Devices at Teotihuacan, Central Mexico Ancient cities housed a large population of craftsmen, masons, priests, emissaries, guards, and people unrelated to the production of foodstuff. In the ancient Near East administrative devices (seals, sealings, bullae, clay tablets, tokens) are evident in the archaeological record, as are storerooms and storage loci. In Classic Mesoamerica, huge urban developments such as Teotihuacan, housed multiethnic populations devoted predominantly to craft activities as well as to the large-scale movement of sumptuary and allochtonous goods. Unfortunately no centralized storage facilities

have been recognized in the site. Even though there are no evident administrative devices such as the Postclassic codexes (the Matricula de Tributos, for example) clay roundels ("tejos") and trinkets are numerous and may represent administrative objects related to the craftsmen themselves. This paper will review the relevant data from the Teopancazco barrio center at Teotihuacan. [96] First Organizer Marceaux, Paul (University of Texas-Austin) [120] The Hasinai Caddo of East Texas: Ceramics and Social Organization In a recent effort to compile information related to Caddo archaeology, I have examined in detail ceramic collections from various historic Native American Caddo sites and Spanish missions in east Texas. My presentation will discuss the efforts to determine if and how specific attributes of ceramic style and technology correlate with sites in the presumed locations of the Hasinai Caddo as indicated by the historical records. It will also demonstrate how relatively user-friendly database software and tools associated with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be used to help answer questions regarding the relationships between material culture and social organization. Marchegay, Sophie (INAH Tamaulipas, México) [260] Body Modification and Ornamentation Depicted in Formative Period Huastec Figurines By the time of Spanish conquest, the Huastec people were renowned for their rich and complex manners of modifying, clothing, and ornamenting their bodies. Practices of body modification and adornment appear to have been ancient in this region. During the Formative period, anthropomorphic clay figurines ­ almost always feminine ­ are shown naked and with artificial cranial deformation, scarification, and body painting. Various ornaments, including a large variety of headdresses and jewelry, are also featured. In this paper I examine these bodily practices evident in Late Formative clay figurines that hail from recent excavations along the southern coast of Tamaulipas. Marcone, Giancarlo (University of Pittsburgh) [114] Pachacamac Temples and Archaeologists' Intervention The Pachacamac site in coastal Peru has been a permanent presence in Peruvian and Andean archaeology. Since the pioneer work of Max Uhle at the end of the XIX century, the site has undergone archaeological interventions. Several of these interventions left physical vestiges at the site and transformed Pachacamac`s Landscape, mixing with the archaeological site and actively changing perspectives about the past. Using specific examples of past interventions at the site, I seek to show how these interventions contribute to create a story of the site that does not necessary match prehistory. Furthermore, I will argue that sites as important as Pachacamac require an archaeology of the archaeologists interventions that have influenced it. Such an endeavor will help us understand how history and heritage were (and are) re-built or manipulated by scholars to construct perceptions of the past that serve their own scholarly or political interests.

The cultural affiliation asserted here is not exclusive, and it is confirmed by archaeological, genetic/biological, and linguistic evidence. However, in most cases this claim has not been recognized in the historic preservation and academic communities. In recent years, the Navajo Nation Historic Preservation Department has worked to strengthen this claim through research and consultation with knowledgeable individuals. This forum seeks to give the people of the Navajo Nation a voice and an opportunity to speak of their experiences and of the difficulties they encounter. Margaris, Amy (Oberlin College) [162] Where Do We Go From Here? The Pursuit of an Archaeological Studies Major at Oberlin College and its Afterlife Oberlin College is a small liberal arts institution in northeast Ohio that offers undergraduate majors in both Anthropology and Archaeological Studies. The Archaeology major is highly interdisciplinary. Students design their own curriculum in close consultation with a faculty advisor from Anthropology, Art, Classics, or Religion, and graduates of the program have obtained higher degrees in all of these fields. Students must participate in a field school (Oberlin offers opportunities in Italy`s Sangro Valley and Kodiak, Alaska) and complete a senior capstone project to graduate. These requirements help majors gain practical experience and disciplinary focus, and add verticality to their coursework. Margus, Drago (Krka National Park, Croatia) [9] Evidence for Marine Shellfish Exploitation at Danilo Bitinj and Pokrovnik 18 species of marine shellfish were recovered in the excavations at Danilo Bitinj and Pokrovnik, a considerable increase on previous estimates. All of them may still be found in the Adriatic Sea today. Of the >26,000 identified specimens, 80% were from the lagoon cockle (Cerastoderma glaucum [Cardium]). Other species included mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis), oyster (Ostrea edulis), Noah`s Ark shell (Arca noae) and European thorny oyster (Spondylus gaederopus). Most were probably collected from the nearby inlet of Morinj and Prukljan Lake. The shellfish were eaten, often after cooking, and also used for ornaments. Marinova-Wolff, Elena [157] see Riehl, Simone Marken, Damien (Southern Methodist University) and Jennifer Piehl [77] Reconstructing Divergent Identities within El Peru-Waka' As a significant milestone in human history, the rise of cities has witnessed extensive archaeological inquiry. Current research has emphasized the plural nature of urban identities, moving beyond conceptions of homogenous urban populations. This paper will present analyses of materials from nearly 200 test excavations in the 10km2 surrounding the Classic Maya center of El Peru-Waka`. Comparisons of these data with more intensive investigations within the center suggest that divergent social groups inhabited distinct areas both within and outside the urban core. Although preliminary, this research advances understanding of the multi-vocal nature of Classic Maya cities and internal polity make-up. Markoe, Glenn [160] see Comer, Douglas C.

Population scientists concerned with long-term trends in demographic profiles ought to be interested in skeletal samples from ancient societies, because they are the only possible source of information. Paleodemography is a slippery research area that must deal with fundamental methodological and technical problems. The goal of this presentation is to evaluate some methodological approaches that are best for doing Paleodemography. The Rostock Manifesto is one of the best; focused on adult aging problems and provided several new techniques to estimate the demographic profile for a target, archaeologically-excavated sample.

The material culture, fortress architecture, and destruction levels found in the South Caucasus during the Late Bronze Age (1500-1200 B.C.) and the Iron I (1200-850 B.C.) periods all seem stress the prominence of interpersonal conflict and increasing militarism in Late Bronze and Iron I society. In this paper we examine the bioarchaeological evidence of trauma from Bronze and Iron I period mortuary sites in the Sevan Basin, Shirak plain, and Tsaghkahovit plain located northern Armenia. Marsteller, Sara (Arizona State University) and Giancarlo Marcone Flores (University of Pittsburgh) [226] The Sociopolitical Significance of Child Burials at Lote B (Cerro Manchay), Lower Lurín Valley (Perú) Children are rarely considered significant in archaeological interpretations of social and political processes. The assumed marginality of children is reinforced by frequent underrepresentation of subadults in mortuary contexts and by common interpretations of subadult remains as sacrificial offerings. The site of Lote B on the

central Peruvian coast presents a unique case study in which natural deaths of subadults were utilized by local rural or regional Lima elites for political means. Burial styles, locations, and associations suggest that local rather than highland Wari state symbols were utilized to garner the support of the lower Lurín Valley population. Marston, John (University of California, Los Angeles) [151] Identifying Agricultural Risk Management Using Paleoethnobotanical Remains Identifying how ancient societies assessed and mitigated the risk of subsistence failure is particularly important for understanding why some pre-industrial agricultural systems flourished and others collapsed. Paleoethnobotanical remains offer an effective mechanism for investigating agricultural risk management systems employed in the past. In this paper, I consider how various theoretical models for risk management lead to specific predictions that can be tested with paleoethnobotanical remains. I then demonstrate the utility of this approach with data from the multi-period mounded site of Gordion in central Anatolia, modern Turkey, which show diachronic changes in agricultural risk management practices at the site. Martin, Alexander (University of Pittsburgh) and Benjamin Carter [67] Regional Craft Standardization Through Domestic Cottage Production: New Data From the Spondylus Industry of Coastal Ecuador Between c. A.D. 700-1200, the manufacture of shell beads, many of which are made from Spondylus, becomes widespread and technologically similar across much of coastal Ecuador. At the same time, settlement pattern analysis suggest that this manufacturing industry was organized around the domestic mode of production as family units included part time shell manufacturing activities within a broader range of subsistence pursuits. This cottage production appears to have resulted in very regularized production sequences and finished products throughout coastal Ecuador without the need for politically coordinated oversight or full-time specialized productive strategies.

The picture of Fort Ancient peoples as consummate maize agriculturalists generally relies on data from excavations of large communities. Recent research at a small settlement in Ohio`s Miami Valley suggests greater variability in Middle Fort Ancient (1200-1400 CE) economies than previously recognized. This research explores alternative explanations for the apparent lack of reliance on maize and seeks to address new questions concerning taphonomic processes, social and economic relationships, and incentives to invest in farming introduced crop species. Martin, Lana (University of California Los Angeles) [232] Reconstructing Paleoenvironmental Instability and Plant Resource Availability at Santa Cruz Island using Macrobotanical Analysis Fluctuations in climate change and biodiversity over time have been linked to changes in human culture and social organization. Identification of plant genera present in macrobotanical samples obtained from four sites on Santa Cruz Island suggests the Chumash were forced to cope with changes in plant resource availability during the Transitional period (A.D. 1150 ­ 1300). Analyses of these patterns of plant availability and usage, compared with previous analyses of other material evidence, contribute to our understanding of how the island Chumash coped with changing resources and why they actually flourished during and after a period of environmental disruption. Martin, Terrance (Illinois State Museum) [125] Animal Exploitation Patterns at French Colonial Sites in the Illinois Country Recent archaeological investigations permit an examination of animal exploitation patterns within the French colonial and post-colonial occupations of the Mississippi Valley. Whereas the small villages in the Illinois Country provided wheat flour and salted pork to French settlements in the lower Mississippi Valley during the eighteenth century, faunal analyses indicate that these Creole habitants relied on wild animals to a greater extent than did those people living at the administrative center at Fort de Chartres. These findings reveal intersite complexity and supplement the sparse documentary record of French colonial foodways. Martin, Trevor (University of Oklahoma) [52] Berry Site Ceramics: An Analysis of Burke Phase Pottery Associated with Fort San Juan The most common class of artifacts recovered at the Berry site is Burke phase ceramics.

Ceramic data from these contexts, including surface treatment, vessel size and form, and serving dish to cooking vessel ratios are compared with ceramics recovered from portions of the site associated with the Native occupation. These data provide a better understanding of daily life at Fort San Juan and offer insights into relations between the people of these different cultures while they were in close, sustained contact. Martinez, Desiree (Harvard University) [181] The "Shoshonean Wedge" Should Only Be the Name of a Shoe: The Wedge Theory and Its Affects on Tongva History and Identity Gabrielino (Tongva) community members have been fighting for federal, state, and local recognition while inserting themselves into projects and processes that deal with their ancestor`s cultural remains and material. However, this movement had been hindered by the idea that the Gabrielino (Tongva) immigrated to Southern California from the Great Basin around 500AD (i.e. Shoshonean Wedge Theory). Scholars and non-scholars alike point to this theory to silence and ignore Gabrielino (Tongva) calls for inclusion in decision making regarding archaeological material within their traditional homelands. This paper explores how academic research has political, social and economic ramifications for the Gabrielino (Tongva) community. [174] Discussant; [127] see Teeter, Wendy G.

Expondré algunas reflexiones relacionadas a la comprensión de los procesos que permitieron un complejo desarrollo sociopolítico regional durante el primer milenio de nuestra era. El aspecto económico, particularmente la minería, serán tratados con mayor énfasis ya que sus productos (piedras azul-verdes, pigmentos minerales, oro en polvo, etc.) fueron la materia prima para la producción de bienes de prestigio, referente importante de su complejidad social. Martinez, Gustavo (CONICET-INCUAPA-UNICEN) [120] Hunter-Gatherer Social Interaction Networks in an Arid Landscape (Argentina) The hunter gatherers who inhabited the lower stream of the Colorado river valley (Pampean-Patagonian transition) underwent organizational changes during the late Holocene. Since 1000 yrs BP subsistence included a boarder spectrum of consumed species, while the exploitation of local raw materials predominated and a more complex pattern of artifact production characterized lithic technology. Mobility decreased and places were used redundantly. Secondary burials are recorded in complex funerary disposals. These changes will be discussed regarding open and close social interaction networks experienced by local residents groups. [47] see Gutierrez, Maria A.

Courtyards within Maya centers are comprised of various architectural forms, and merit further exploration in terms of how we conceptualize the social practices that take place within these socially constructed spaces. Departing from a strictly functionalist view, this paper explores the architecture of a miniacropolis occupied from the Late Preclassic through the Late/Terminal Classic periods at La Milpa, Belize, through a relational account and a configurational view of space.

Marwick, Ben (University of Washington) [194] Do Model-based Explanations suit Archaeology Better than Inference to the Best Explanation? Lars Fogelin`s recent paper on Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE) has substantially sharpened the focus on how archaeologists actually explain, and advocated a historically and philosophically popular approach to explanation. In this paper I argue for a different approach to explanation based on model-building and ranking. I discuss van Frassen`s objections to IBE, the revival of the hypothesis testing in historical sciences and current work in philosophy of science in general and biology in particular. These recent developments suggest that a better way to articulate mechanisms of cause and effect in archaeology is likely to involve modeling and model selection. Maschner, Herbert (Idaho State University) and Buck Benson (Idaho State University) [175] Interaction Spheres and Aleut Ethnogenesis Historically the Aleut were differentiated into eight language dialects and at least twenty regional polities focused around specific island groups. Social networks across this 2100km region were facilitated by advanced boating technology and mental maps of considerable scale. Excavations on the western Alaska Peninsula and analyses of igneous lithic materials demonstrate that some of these networks were in place as early as 3300 BC. Comparable data to the east indicate that these networks did not include regions that were occupied by non-Aleut peoples in historic times. These findings demonstrate that Aleut social boundaries were established early and continued for millennia.

Pennsylvania`s Survey and Excavation at Tepe Hissar in North Eastern Iran (1931-2, 1976) through GIS. The necessity of digitizing legacy data from past excavations and surveys is becoming increasingly important as archaeologists continue to shift into a digital environment for analysis and archival purposes. Vast archaeological datasets still exist in undigitized form in books and museum basements; digitization often presents several challenging problems. Managing the legacy data from the Penn Museum's excavations at Tepe Hissar in northeastern Iran (1931-2, 1976) provides a case study of how this digital era of archaeology is reexamining the archaeological record.

Emphasizing commonalities among regions, an explanatory model cited competition over long distance trade in Spondylus shell. Subsequent research supports shell working within domestic contexts as a constant throughout the period, first within the context of an increase in settlements dispersing into inland drainages and finally to a population shift to nucleated centers along the coast ca. AD 600-800. Spondylus shell working is one of the constants across regions but does not explain the now recognized diversity in "regional developments". Mathews, Jennifer [212] see Glover, Jeffrey B.

While the presence of kumara in Polynesian archaeological sites provided conclusive evidence of prehistoric contact between South America and Polynesia our discovery of pre-Columbian Polynesian chicken bones at El Arenal, Chile indicated that the voyaging was two way, yet people still question the interpretation of this result. Evidence of Polynesians or their direct descendents, found in a secure prehistoric context would put the issue to rest.

The ongoing case, known as Cerberus Action has (to date) indicted and charged 25 subjects in with violations of ARPA and NAGPRA. Cerberus Action has created a marriage of science and law enforcement in order to support and ensure the success of the largest ARPA case in history.

(Univ of British Columbia) and Jesse Morin (University of British Columbia) [84] Differentiating Archaic and Basketmaker II Projectile Point Manufacturing Techniques Geib recently argued that production technologies differ for Archaic versus Basketmaker II projectile points; for the latter, indirect punches and wide compound pressure flakers were used to produce very thin, broad bifaces. To test this model we measured 6 attributes of flake scar morphology on Archaic and BM II bifaces from Cedar Mesa. These variables show statistically significant differences between the two groups of artifacts in accord with Geib`s model. Metric multidimensional scaling of these attributes clearly differentiates Archaic from BM II bifaces and also detects previously misclassified artifacts. This BM II technological tradition may well be an enculturated style useful for tracking populations. Matson, R.G. [84] First Organizer; [84] see Curewitz, Diane; [84] see Kemp, Brian M.

Caves also present a challenging environment. They are often difficult to reach, are dark, and contain complex terrain. Recreational cavers can be an excellent resource to use in cave archaeology studies. Their knowledge of cave locations and skills in navigating the cave environment often mean that they are the first to find sites within caves. A friendly relationship between cavers and archaeologists is required to gain access to that knowledge and to the assistance that cavers can provide in reaching caves and the deposits within them. Mazow, Laura (East Carolina University) [186] Throwing the Baby Out with the Bathwater: Innovations in Mediterranean Textile Production at the End of the 2nd/Beginning of the 1st Millennium BCE Bronze Age bathtubs from the eastern Mediterranean have been interpreted as basins for bathing and/or purification rituals. Their findspots, however, demonstrate that bathtubs` are often found in industrial locations in association with weaving tools. This context suggests that bathtubs functioned within the manufacture and production of textiles. I propose that bathtubs were used for fulling wool. The identification of fulling in the archaeological record of the Late Bronze and early Iron Ages corresponds with a suite of other

McAllister, Martin (WCRM / ARI) [86] Archaeological Damage Assessment Under ARPA: A Long, Strange Trip There are four periods in the history of archaeological damage assessment under ARPA: 1979 through 1984 (statute only): 1984 through 2000 (statute and regulations); 2000 through 2003 (statute, regulations and specialized training); and 2003 through the present (statute, regulations, specialized training and professional standards). This presentation will discuss how the professional status of archaeological damage assessment has progressed through these four periods to its current level of development today. Also addressed will be the positive and negative aspects of the current state of this process relative to ARPA litigation in the future.

Research at Pirque Alto is beginning to reveal a number of important socio-cultural developments including one of the earliest copper smelting industries in the Andes, an ongoing exchange relationship with distant populations, and a clear material culture influence from the Titicaca Basin. These and other recent findings from research at Pirque Alto will be discussed in this presentation. [94] Second Organizer; [162] see Anderson, David A.

[248] Resistant Foragers: The Problem of Low Maize Ubiquity at Sites in the Northern Rio Grande Valley In much of the Southwest, people appear to have been significantly invested in maize horticulture by A.D. 200 and earlier. However, in the Northern Rio Grande Valley, maize seems to have played only a supplemental role in subsistence strategies until much later. Although there is evidence that maize was grown in the region by 1200 B.C., its remains do not become archaeologically ubiquitous until A.D. 600 or later. We propose that potentially rich piñon harvests, combined with locally abundant cheno-ams and other wild seeds, provided sufficient yields of easily stored foods, making the labor costs for maize agriculture generally unattractive.

This has been particularly acute for the Postclassic` period based on ethnohistorical accounts, and supported by polychrome pottery with Mexican iconography. Excavations along Lake Nicaragua have specifically targeted the ethnicity of cultural groups dating to the Bagaces and Sapoa periods, with interest in cultural changes and continuities. This paper presents results of these investigations as they relate to the Out of Mexico` theory, concluding that while some evidence suggests ideological affiliation there is also conflicting evidence to suggest a more complex process of culture change.

McCarty, Sue Ann (University of Virginia) [64] Transforming Cattle into Rain: Reassessing Relationships with Animals in the Late Neolithic Halaf of Northern Mesopotamia The relationship between nature and culture forms a fundamental part of the way human communities understand order in the world. Ceramics from the Halaf cultural horizon (5,900-5,350 Cal. B.C.E.) in northern Mesopotamia are well-known for their prominent painted depictions of natural forms and, especially, cattle in various states of transformation and abstraction. Although many other domestic animals were also utilized, cattle often formed a major source of meat in Halaf villages. This paper discusses the possible role of cattle pastoralism as a source of inequality in a time period for which the evidence for marked status differentiation remains uncertain.

McCormick, Charla (Indiana University) and Frederika Kaestle (Indiana University) [257] Burial Location and Maternal Relatedness at Angel Mounds In the early years of excavation at Angel Mounds over 300 human burials were uncovered, many of which occurred in the eastern village area of the site. However, a number of individuals were buried in other locations as well, such as within mound structures and outside palisade walls. This raises the question whether familial relationships affected burial location at Angel, as they often do today. In this paper, the spatial patterning of burials on the landscape at Angel Mounds is addressed by analyzing ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) recovered from Angel residents. Maternal relationships present among the mortuary population are discussed. McCormick, Michael (Harvard University) [243] A Small Town Experiences the Fall of the Roman Empire: (2) Thinking about Tarquimpol`s New Answers to an Old Question The results outlined in Henning`s paper offer new insights into the end of the Roman empire whose importance transcends the local situation. The hitherto unknown restoration of a settlement center at Tarquimpol in the fourth century and its subsequent demise shed important new light on the archaeology and history of the security challenges, imperial responses, and the communications systems that characterized the late Roman and post-Roman period. They powerfully exemplify the way in which archaeological and historical investigation can be brought together to illuminate the human past. This paper will present further new findings from Tarquimpol and the written sources, and discuss the archaeological results in the light of recent historical investigation, particularly with respect to the Roman and post-Roman economy. McCorriston, Joy (The Ohio State University) and Matthew Senn (The Ohio State University) [11] Political Ecology of Frankincense Production in Southern Arabia The South Arabian archaeological record suggests pure pastoral economies (household labor dedicated to herding domesticated animals) emerging before agriculture, offering a diachronic perspective on ethnographic observations of political tribal organization confronting centralized states. Arabian prehistory raises questions about how socioeconomic factors of (re-)production in pastoral ecosystems constrained other environmental choices, including agriculture and participation in the frankincense trade of Arabia `s Caravan Kingdoms. Current research in Yemen and southern Oman incorporating remote sensing and archaeological survey data has generated a GIS modeling least-cost pathways for ancient pastoral groups. This research explores pastoralists` participation and engagement with centralized Arabian states.

Since the 75th Anniversary of the FDR`s work-relief projects was celebrated in 2008, it is important to remember that WPA archaeology, through the use of Illinois' unemployed labor force, established the basic cultural chronologies we use today; the current state of our archaeological knowledge is largely the result of the foundation laid by the Illinois' WPA archaeological initiative.

But, it is less common for archaeologists to use the digital elevation model (DEM) produced by this method for other purposes, such as spatial analysis. In this study, we discuss the application of a high quality, lidar derived DEM in reconstructing how irrigation water was diverted and allocated in agricultural fields build by Native Hawaiians in the era before European contact. This paper builds upon traditional field survey and excavation data of canals and fields and demonstrates the value of research directed applications of spatial technology.

Composing a Lencan Identity from the Archaeological Record of Western Honduras Recent efforts of the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History have renewed interest in investigating the diversity of pre-Columbian and historic communities of Honduras. For archaeologists working in Honduras, a specific outcome has been a reconsideration of the dynamic and multi-ethnic composition of the region. In this paper we synthesize a decade of our own research in locales across Honduras and suggest a move beyond essentialized models focused on constructs such as the non-Maya to those that emphasize distinctive communities across time and space. In essence, we argue that the data show what it means to be Lenca in pre-Columbian times varied across time, space, and socio-historical context. McGaha, Shaun [217] see Lockhart, Jamie J.

Two subsequent summers of field-school excavations revealed a severely burnt structure with several unique features, dating to the earliest periods of Mississippian occupation at Angel Mounds, circa A.D. 1100. Most impressive among these features was a well-preserved cane mat that covered the structure`s ground surface, and large pottery vessels (one fully intact) resting on the mat. The excavations and lab analyses augment our understanding of life at Angel Mounds during its formative periods. [257] First Chair [257] Second Organizer McGill, Dru [257] see Stockdell, Eric K. McGuire, Randall (Binghamton University) [167] Archaeology as Political Action in the Coalfields The Ludlow Massacre and the Battle of Blair Mountain represent two of the most violent and clearest examples of class warfare in U.S. history. Excavating the remains of these conflicts defies the ideology that class warfare never occurred and propels archaeologists into political struggles. A theory of archaeological praxis can guide us in such struggles. Praxis uses the craft of archaeology to help communities construct meaningful, honest histories, and to strive for real collaboration. At Ludlow and Blair Mountain, praxis challenges the omnipresent class struggles of the modern world by working in solidarity with working people.

Mortuary data, however, can also be used to understand important differences in gender, age, and burial time. Burial goods and treatments have the potential to share information about the social structures and behaviors of the living, and by using correspondence analysis, the meanings of certain burial treatments and goods can be seen to be associated with a specific gender or age group. This study exposes social dynamics and gender-object associations of the living by using correspondence analysis on mortuary data.

McIntosh, Susan [121] see Cisse, Mamadou McKee, Arlo [72] The Application of Ground Penetrating Radar at Kanorado, an Early Paleoindian Locality in Northwest Kansas The Kanorado locality in northwestern Kansas consists of three Early Paleoindian sites with cultural deposits 1-2 m beneath an alluvial terrace. A Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey of site 14SN106 was conducted in an attempt to delineate the site stratigraphy. High attenuation rates at the site limited the depth of imaging and resolution of the survey. However, the survey was successful because it helped to delineate the extent of the site as well as an unknown paleo-arroyo under the terrace. This study demonstrates how GPR can be an effective research tool even if cultural remains are not imaged directly. McKee, Arlo [231] see Fullerton, Ben L.

Collaboration between California State Parks and Cabrillo College resulted in the systematic excavation of over twelve cubic meters of site deposit during the 2008 field school.

Relying upon pollen analysis of two sediment cores, I will argue that the historical accumulation of human strategies, decisions, and actions have shaped and continue to shape this landscape. In particular, I challenge our conceptions of industrialization as a rupture and end of "natural" nature. Drawing on examples from an industrial, remnant wetland and a conservation area, this presentation will introduce the themes of this symposium and explore the ways in which the political ecological perspective can advance archaeological research and theory.

McLoughlin, Patrick (USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service) [249] A Look at Two Buried Prehistoric Sites in the Driftless Area of Southeast Minnesota The Upper Mississippi River Valley cuts through the rugged and unglaciated Driftless Area. This unique setting of rich and diverse natural habitats characterized by dramatic limestone bluffs, river valleys, and forested hillsides starts at Lake Pepin, below Red Wing, Minnesota, and ends near Dubuque, Iowa. In recent years there has been an increase in funding at both the state and federal level to implement streambank protection practices along smaller tributaries of the Mississippi River in the Driftless Area. The goals of these practices are to impede erosion, improve water quality, and improve riparian and prime cold water fish habitat. This paper focuses on two buried prehistoric archaeological sites encountered in the Driftless Area of southeast Minnesota during compliance activities for federally funded streambank stabilization projects. These stratified, multicomponent sites, that appear to date from the Woodland period to possibly well into the Archaic, are helping to shed light on time periods and site types that are poorly known in the Driftless Area and Upper Mississippi River Valley in general.

The excavation and flotation of sediment from large features at Laguinho, a site in the central Amazon, is helping to break this paradigm as seed material has been recovered.

Medeiros, Melanie (University of Arizona/William Self Associates) [213] Performance Theory and the Archaeological Record: Theorizing Hohokam Feasts Realization that feasting is an important aspect of many societies has driven archaeologists interested in politics, power, ritual, and ideology to explore how feasting was actively involved in the performance of these concepts. While recent studies have recognized this performative nature of feasting, few have utilized performance theory to explore the political, ritual, or ideological aspects of feasts. Application of performance theory to feasting data from several Hohokam sites suggests that while feasting was an important activity, further refinement of the archaeological data set is necessary before inferences regarding the performative significance of Hohokam feasts can be made.

The extreme longevity of settlement at Chan (roughly 800 B.C.-1200 A.D.) in contrast to the rapid florescence and decline of other larger sites in the Belize River Valley allows us to examine the impact these major socio-political changes had on the maintenance of exchange networks that supplied smaller settlements with obsidian.

A holistic approach to Tayata data including bioarchaeological, faunal, and ethnographic information illuminates key aspects of the embodiment of Tayata figurines and indicates a relationship between the life cycle termination of both human and non-human figurines relating to the post-mortem treatment of individuals.

Yet, assumptions about the nature, severity and abruptness of Younger Dryas cooling are often based on cores from the Greenland ice sheet. There changes were significant. However, a review of climatic and environmental records from the Plains and Rocky Mountains indicate that conditions in these regions were hardly so demanding. Accordingly, such changes as occurred may not have measurably added to the challenges routinely faced by Paleoindian groups. Meltzer, David [224] see Holliday, Vance T.

Mendoza, Rubén (CSU Monterey Bay) [89] Archaeoastronomy and Solar Eucharistic Worship in the Millennial New World A new Hispanic Catholic doctrine rose with the conquest of the Americas, which linked Armageddon to indigenous conversions. The imminent return of the Solar Christ is seen in meridian alignments and the solar geometry of Colonial and Hispanic Catholic missions, church iconography, and tabernacle enclosures from throughout the Southwest and Mesoamerica. Feast day illuminations and meridian alignments were discovered at twelve of twenty-one California missions, seventeen Southwestern sites, as well as others in Mesoamerica and Perú. Fully one-third of these sites were constructed with heliocentric, calendrical, and or solar Eucharistic considerations in their syncretic and millenarian elaboration and architectonic layout. [89] First Chair Mendusic, Marko (Ministry of Culture, Croatia) and Emil Podrug [9] The culture of Danilo Bitinj and Pokrovnik: results of excavations from 2003 to 2006 Excavations at Danilo Bitinj (2003-2005) and Pokrovnik (2006) have illuminated the Early Neolithic (Impressed Ware) and Middle Neolithic (Danilo) cultural episodes in Dalmatia. Both sites were large villages with considerable horizontal variation in structures, including terrace walls, houses, and pits. This variety suggests that each settlement had a complex layout. The abundant artifacts, including large quantities of pottery and some ground stone tools, flints, bone artifacts and other objects, attest to the cultural richness that developed during the Neolithic in Dalmatia. Mentzer, Susan (University of Arizona), Mary Stiner (University of Arizona) and Mihriban Özbasaran (Istanbul University) [259] Micromorphological Investigations of Anthropogenic Features at the Aceramic Neolithic site of Asikli Höyük, Turkey Asikli Höyük is a Neolithic tell situated in Anatolia`s Cappadocia region. In conjunction with a new phase of conservation and excavation, micromorphological samples were collected from anthropogenic features (walls, floors and midden) in order to characterize and compare building materials, maintenance, discard, and post-depositional modifications amongst three occupation levels. The construction materials vary in texture, carbonate content, temper and other inclusions. Floors exhibit phases of construction and maintenance, while overlying fills contain debris related to combustion and domestic activity. Analyses of middens reveal well-preserved refuse lenses as well as plant materials, phosphates and calcareous spherulites likely derived from ruminant dung.

This method can incorporate heterogeneous data and is able to reveal and deconstruct overlapping areas into their constituent elements. We will also discuss the results of the method applied to a Chumash Early period habitation site (CA-LAn-803) from coastal southern California that enables us to distinguish several spatially cohesive sets ("tool kits") of artifact types and relate these to specific types of "indoor" and "outdoor" activities.

The archaeological recovery of grinding stone technologies provides insight into prehistoric processing strategies, yet their actual function and the plants utilized remains speculative. This paper presents preliminary findings from an extensive starch grain analysis study focused on mortars and metates recovered from mid-Holocene sites distributed throughout the Lower Illinois River Valley. Findings demonstrate that this technology was used to process substances including small seeds. This data has implications for increasing our understanding of mid-Holocene human/environmental interactions in the mid-continent and abroad.

This study identified important factors and patterns in the buying habits of the region`s slaveholding farmers. One key component was the Panic of 1837, when land prices artificially rose in value instead of decreasing due to planter activity. Others include the location of purchased land

Kupferle Foundry site, a late-19th-century iron and brass foundry located in northern St. Louis. The factory was in operation from 1882 to 1910, and represents a transition from preindustrial to industrial manufacturing. The factory was built on the former location of Big Mound, the last vestige of the St. Louis Mound Group finally destroyed in 1869. Several historic features, dating to the critical period between the destruction of the mound and the establishment of the foundry, were also uncovered below the factory foundations.

Established in the 1820s as the country`s first "Infantry School of Practice", this property continues to meet the needs of the National Guard as an active and significant training center. Military sites such as this face constant modernization in the form of renovation, construction, and demolition. These alternations must be considered in context of a property listed on the National Register while actively serving the military. This paper will discuss past and current successes in the management of Jefferson Barracks, the military gateway that opened the west. Meyers, Maureen (University of Kentucky) [127] Frontier Landscapes and Power Formation at the Mississippian border Frontiers are unique landscapes because they are physically and metaphorically removed from core regions' power. They are often placed in mountain areas because they contain natural resources prized by cores for trade good production. Frontiers are areas where identity is more malleable than at the core, and as a result, power is more easily co-opted through control of trade. This paper will examine the Mississippian frontier Carter Robinson mound site to identify how power formation within a frontier landscape varies through an analysis of architectural grammar, ceramic attributes and trade goods. Michel, Mark (The Archaeological Conservancy) [86] Discussant Mickelson, Andrew (University of Memphis) [244] The Unobtrusive Mississippian Village: Rethinking Late Prehistoric Settlement Patterns in Western Tennessee Magnetometry, surface survey, and excavation results from the Early Mississippian Ames site located in southwestern Tennessee are presented. For decades Ames was known only for its four platform mounds and an associated "low density" artifact scatter. The seeming lack of a village scale settlements in the Ames region had perplexed researchers for decades. Magnetometry and excavation data, however, revealed that the mounds are part of a community plan that included a 2 ha village surrounded by a substantial palisade. Surface survey and test pit data utilized in the development of prehistoric landuse models are reexamined in light of these findings.

Chorro de Maíta, Cuba A dental anthropological study of 76 dentitions from the site of El Chorro de Maíta, Banes, Cuba, was carried out in order to understand diet and subsistence strategies, possible gender-based divisions in teeth-as-tools` activities, and the implications hereof for oral and general health. The site, which dates to the Late Ceramic Age and early contact period, has yielded interesting preliminary results, including the first case of intentional dental modification at an Amerindian site in the Caribbean, and a small number of cases of what appears to be a new form of LSAMAT (lingual surface attrition of the maxillary anterior teeth). Mihok, Lorena (University of South Florida) [204] Consequences of Contact in the Bay Islands Although the Bay Islands of Honduras were claimed by Spain in the sixteenth century, English settlers, along with French and Dutch buccaneers began arriving in the islands during the early seventeenth century. By using historical descriptions of indigenous and European settlements as guides to archaeological investigation, this research contributes to a baseline of knowledge regarding the early colonial period of the islands before the removal of indigenous populations by Spain in 1650. As modern development threatens to destroy remaining archaeological resources, culture contact studies are vital to our understanding of the ways in which colonial interactions have shaped contemporary attitudes toward identity and heritage.

Mayapan remains the center of greatest production and iconographic diversity. Some Central Mexican gods indicate contact with the Central Highlands, but most are Maya deities, including well known gods from the codices. Paired figures probably served as katun idols, in accord with Landa`s descriptions. Other groupings may represent cosmological diagrams. The censer cult was widespread at a number of sites in Campeche, Peten, Belize, and on the east coast of Quintana Roo, sites where censer use continued after the fall of Mayapan in 1450.

Much of Galicia is densely vegetated and topographically rugged, making traditional survey techniques difficult. In the last 4 years, a systematic survey of the Paleolithic occupation has been undertaken in the inland areas of Galicia. Alternate technologies, such as remote sensing and GIS analysis, have been a valuable supplement to traditional methods for detecting sites and land-use patterns ­ with potential application to regional studies elsewhere in temperate Europe. Miller, Christopher (University of Tübingen) and Paul Goldberg (Boston University) [157] Geoarchaeology, Paleoenvironments and Settlement Dynamics in the Swabian Jura: A Micromorphological Approach A micromorphological study of Hohle Fels and Geißenklösterle caves revealed a variety of sediments that permitted us to interpret taphonomic influences and variations in deposition linked to climatic changes. We observed a marked difference in sediments at the

Middle-Upper Paleolithic boundary that represents a shift from a warmer environment to a colder, drier environment. These results are linked with analysis of anthropogenic deposits to interpret past behavior and settlement systems within the caves. Our results show that the virtual absence of Middle Paleolithic occupation prior to initial Aurignacian settlement in the two caves was not connected to unfavorable climatic conditions.

Gingerich (University of Wyoming) [90] Ambiguous Chronologies and Biface Morphology: Examining Spatial and Temporal Trends in Eastern Fluted Points In the Eastern United States, stratified sites extending into the Paleoindian period are extremely rare. As a result, researchers often have to rely on well-dated sites from outside the region to extrapolate chronological sequences. To this end, this analysis utilizes a geometric morphometrics approach to compare samples of Eastern fluted points recorded in the Paleoindian Database of the Americas (PIDBA) with those from well-dated contexts from other regions. Finally, we argue that the application of multivariate approaches and the creation of adequate comparative samples may prove invaluable for understanding spatial and temporal trends in Paleoindian biface morphology.

Different types of ritual deposits were formed through such actions. This paper explores how abandonments of transitory pueblo settlements were mediated through communal ritual and decision-making practices and how the materiality of such termination practices reflects geographies of social relations involved in the abandonment of place and movements across the landscape.

Millhauser, John (Northwestern University) [13] Obsidian, Conflict, and Commerce in Postclassic Tlaxcala Obsidian was a key commodity in Tlaxcala during its century-long conflict with the Aztec empire. Domestic needs notwithstanding, provisioning weapons required access to high-quality sources of obsidian. This paper presents an XRF analysis of a random sample of 45 gray obsidian artifacts from systematic surface collections at three Postclassic Tlaxcalan sites: Tepeticpac, Ocotelulco, and Quiahuixtlan. Surprisingly, the Tlaxcalans acquired as much as 75% of their obsidian from the Paredon source in Hidalgo, within the sphere of Aztec influence. With these data, I consider the "flowery war" and how and why states engage in sustained conflict. Millhouse, Philip (University of Illinois-ITARP) [88] Burial Mound Preservation in Northwestern Illinois and the Success of Multi-Party Cooperation Since 2003 the University of Illinois-ITARP has been involved in preservation efforts with the Jo Daviess County Conservation Foundation and several state agencies.

We outline our efforts to build a macroregional GIS-based database of ceramics, obsidian, and architecture, and then discuss some of the results of the application of social network analysis to the data. We focus on questions addressing network dynamics before, during, and after the late 13th century migrations to elucidate how social network analysis augments interpretations of regional interaction in archaeology.

Mound 2 (AD 1430) is notable for interment of primarily females (15/20) and its charnel structure that housed four pairs of individuals. Mitochondrial DNA sequences from these individuals are used to assess the influence of maternal genetic relatedness on the placement of individuals within the mound, including proximity to the charnel structure and within pairs. We also compare these results to aDNA analyses from other Midwest sites. Milner, George (Pennsylvania State University) [61] Population, Economy, and Warfare: Their Relationship to Sociopolitical Evolution in Prehistoric Eastern North America Long-term trends in population size, subsistence practices, and warfare in eastern North America are quantified and summarized within the context of changes over time in sociopolitical complexity. Of special interest are 1) different rates of population growth that do not correspond to conventional archaeological periods or cultural stages; 2) an occasionally step-like, as distinct from gradual, transformation in ways of life, specifically subsistence economies; and 3) variation in the intensity of warfare. While population, economy, and conflict appear to be intimately related to one another, archaeological demonstrable relationships among them defy simple explanatory mechanisms in the Eastern Woodlands or elsewhere.

Mires, Ann Marie [69] Discussant Misarti, Nicole (Institute of Marine Science ­ UAF), Bruce Finney (Idaho State University) and Herbert Maschner (Idaho State University) [175] Isotopes and Social Complexity in the Aleut Region Recent genetic and isotopic analyses of human remains from the Aleutian Islands have revived the debate of population continuation versus replacement ~1,000 years ago among the Aleut. Genetic data suggest a closely related population (Neo-Aleut) moved into the region and co-existed with the earlier population (Paleo-Aleut). The isotope data have been interpreted as Neo-Aleuts hunting at higher trophic levels than Paleo-Aleuts. Using isotopic data of the actual foods consumed, we propose that the genetic and isotopic differences found are based not on population movements but on effects of increasing social complexity and differential access to higher status foods. Misarti, Nicole [27] see Lech, Veronica Mitchell, Mark (Paleocultural Research Group) [220] Modeling Middle Missouri Warfare In their studies of warfare, anthropologists and archaeologists have mainly been interested in its causes, especially its origins, and its consequences, especially for social evolution. Less attention has been paid to how warfare articulated with other cultural, social, and economic practices in various times and places. The abundant evidence for recurring, organized conflict among agricultural communities in the Middle Missouri affords an opportunity to consider how warfare functioned as a social institution. A model for Middle Missouri warfare is developed using archaeological, ethnographic, oral historical, and documentary data from the Plains. Mitchell, Seth (Caprock Environmental Services) [150] One Project, Over 60 Eligible Sites: No Problems? From 2007-2009 a phased archaeological investigation was conducted on the 639-mile Rockies Express East Pipeline (REXEAST) Project.

[150] First Organizer; [179] First Organizer Mizoguchi, Koji (Kyushu University, Japan) [113] Explaining the Emergence of Large-scale Centralized Hierarchy: A Network Theory-based Approach This paper reveals by applying social network analysis-derived methods that the centralised hierarchy that emerged at the beginning of the Kofun (mounded tomb) period in Japan can be explained by the geographical locations that the polities to be hierarchised occupy and the differences in the topological potentials that these locations generate. The paper argues that the topological structure of a social network itself can be a significant cause of its own hierarchisation, and it compares the finding with the manner in which the concepts of agency and power are applied to the explanation of social hierarchisation and centralisation in general.

Mound A was constructed by stacking10-15-cm-thick turf blocks 2m high near its center. The chronology of a structure excavated by Black (1955) on top of Mound A indicates that the mound was used throughout site occupation but like Mound F, also excavated by Black (1939-1942), its surface was buried just prior to site abandonment. This final mound capping may be part of a ceremonial closing of the Angel site.

Recent studies on the complete faunal and lithic assemblages offer new insights into human occupation and behavior. The emergence and development of Levallois knapping, bifacial shaping flakes, predominant use of local stones, specialized hunting focused on one main herbivore, and higher fragmentation of bones in the middle and upper parts of the sequence gives us an opportunity to discuss evolutionary processes. Mongelluzzo, Ryan (University of California - Riverside) [99] Ahaw in the Abstract: Ancient Maya Rulership as a Power Strategy The foundations for Ancient Maya rulership led to particular strategies meant to maintain the hierarchical social relationships that were in place. By using various theories on power to provide a nuanced definition of Maya rulership, one can gain a better understanding of the efforts that were undertaken by these sovereigns. Of particular use are the works of de Certeau, Foucault, and Gil. I am particularly interested in how the nature of Maya rulership subsequently affected architectural design choices in the spatial layout of royal palaces.

Its performance entails social actions implicated in the formation of identity; they create a specific range of social experiences, abilities, qualities and responsibilities and a specific relationship of self to society. Moody, Carlisle (University of Oklahoma) [52] Structure 1 at 31Bk468: Public Space in Joara's Shadow A compound of five large buildings at the Berry site in western North Carolina probably housed Spanish soldiers stationed at Fort San Juan, built by Juan Pardo in 1567. In 2005, archaeologists identified and excavated a similar and contemporary structure at the Ensley Site (31Bk468), a mile from Berry. Lithic data from Structure 1 at Ensley suggest that it was a public building and possibly a men`s house. Comparison of the Ensley structure with those from Berry suggests different uses for these architectural spaces and allows us to hypothesize about the relationship between the two sites during this time. Mooney, Douglas (Philadelphia Archaeological Forum (PAF)) [3] Discussant Moore, Andrew (RIT), Anthony Legge (University of Cambridge), Kelly Reed (UCL) and Susan Colledge (UCL) [9] Economy, Chronology, and Environment Large-scale sieving and flotation of the excavated deposits from Pokrovnik and Danilo Bitinj have yielded significant quantities of charred plant remains and animal bones from domestic species. The economy of both sites was a mature farming system based on cultivated cereals and caprine herding. Interviews with traditional farmers are illuminating farming practices during the Neolithic. 20 AMS dates, mostly from charred seeds, document occupation from c. 8,000 to 6,800 CalBP. The two sites were located in a well-filled landscape of intervisible villages in every valley from the coast inland to the foothills.

The project developed from archaeological and documentary evidence supporting the Berry site (31BK22) as the location of the Native American town of Joara and the Spanish Fort San Juan, constructed in 1567 and destroyed in 1568. This paper summarizes the history of the project and the comprehensive research design focused on native responses to early contact with European invaders. We also discuss the opportunities and challenges of coordinating a long-term public archaeology project. [52] First Chair Moore, David [52] see Rodning, Christopher B.; [52] see Beck, Robin A.

Research at Chiripa allows this assemblage to be compared to multiple aspects of the local and regional archaeological sequence.

Questions emerging from the analysis of more than 2000 bone artifacts include 1) the locus and organization of bone tool manufacture, 2) how supposed weaving tools related to production of camelids for wool, and 3) the response of the bone tool industry to broad shifts in subsistence. [245] Discussant Moore, Michael (Tennessee Division of Archaeology) and Kevin Smith (Middle Tennessee State University) [217] Archaeological Explorations of the Peabody Museum in Middle Tennessee, 1877-1884 The Peabody Museum at Harvard University sponsored archaeological explorations across Middle Tennessee between 1877 and 1884. Extensive records and artifact collections from 38 site investigations were uncovered during three research trips to the Peabody Museum and Harvard University Archives between 1998 and 2002. The authors transcribed roughly 550 pages of letters, field notes, and other written materials generated from these expeditions; and also conducted an analysis of roughly 1700 complete to nearly complete mortuary objects. Using the site records and artifact data, we present hypotheses to refine our previously published chronological periods for Middle Cumberland Mississippian sites. Moore-Shay, Laura (University of Notre Dame), Alissa Nauman (Washington State University), Ian Kuijt (University of Notre Dame), and John O'Neil (University College Dublin) [185] The Iron Age Shell Middens of Omey Island, Co. Galway, Ireland Archaeological survey of the northwest corner of Omey Island, Co. Galway, Ireland, has identified over 100 prehistoric and historic sites. The majority of these are collections of shell and fire cracked rock, typically covering an area of less than 25m2 horizontal and 40 cm deep, and are situated inland by up to 200 meters. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the majority of the shell middens date to the Iron Age period, a period that remains poorly known in Galway. The results of this research are used to reflect upon marine resource use during the Iron Age. Moraes, Bruno (Universidade Federal do Amazonas - UFAM (Brazil)) [142] Rethinking the Space: GIS applied to the Central Amazonian Archaeology Archaeological research in the Central Amazonian region has produced a large corpus of data over the last fifteen years. A new theoretical approach, allied to empirical data, has led to different accounts of traditional models of occupation for the Amazon in general. This project organizes the sum of this empirical work into a single spatialized database, in order to produce a predictive model for the occurrence of archaeological features within the research area. Results of this work make possible the prospection of new sites, as well as the testing of land use pattern models and ancient landscape reconstruction. [142] Third Organizer Moraes, Claide (Universidade de Sao Paulo) [142] Ring Villages in the Central Amazon: A COntrast Between the Paredão and Guarita Phases We present the results of survey, excavation, and analysis of archaeological material from sites in the Lago do Limão and along the Madeira River, Amazonas State, Brazil. In the Lago do Limão the sites have mounds constructed during the Paredão phase (7th to 12th century AD) and structured as ring villages. Based on the ceramic chronology of these archaeological sites and the structure of villages in the landscape, a hypothesis is proposed to explain the relation between polychrome ceramics (Guarita phase 9th to 15th century AD), and the Paredão phase.

drawings to low-relief engravings and their more sculptural cousins, modified speleothems. Typically, these speleothems are modified with faces, or face-like forms, having the visual effect of transforming the cave formations from mere supports into virtual torsos. This anthropomorphization allows for a mode of communication beyond and more expressive than that of a simple signifier-signified relationship. This allows for communication with a uniquely human affect, that of a worlding, a face to face human encounter. Cave art from Cuba will illustrate this phenomenon. Ethnohistoric sources will illuminate its possible significance.

My approach consisted in a study of the assemblages of this given region, including economical, typological and technological aspects. Geißenklösterle cave served as the starting point due to the quality of the excavation method and given the stratigraphic integrity of the site, demonstrated by refits. Through this integrity, the Aurignacian and Gravettian industries of this site constitute key reference series for the early and middle Upper Palaeolithic of Central Europe. Morehart, Christopher (Northwestern University) [13] Configurations of Prosperity, Power and Tragedy: Cooperation and Change in the Creation, Maintenance, and Collapse of Chinampa Agriculture at Xaltocan, Mexico Archaeological research complicates the romanticism of past peoples as timeless stewards of their environmental milieu. This work serves as a corrective critique for modern planners who envision the reconstruction of traditional practices as providing a solution to contemporary problems. The relationships people established with their environment were embedded in particular historical milieus. Sustainability, thus, is fundamentally a social issue. This paper presents such an approach by examining chinampa farming at the Postclassic, central Mexican community of Xaltocan. Configurations of household autonomy, communal cooperation, and political economy were critical components in this landscape`s history, including its development, persistence, and eventual collapse. Morell-Hart, Shanti (U.C. Berkeley) [151] Practical Re-imagining of Ancient Plant Use Paleoethnobotanical data emerge as a reflection of our practices, and vice versa, especially in terms of such loaded concepts as weeds. Using daily practice as starting point, and borrowing from linguistic analogs, I here explore ways of considering plants that allow for more overlap of activities and meanings surrounding them. By slightly reshaping the conceptual framework, and retooling the methods, I detail an alternate possible set of paleoethnobotanical practices, including how data may be split and lumped, and subsequently analyzed and interpreted. I use, as case study, archaeobotanical materials recovered from the site of Currusté, Honduras. [132] Second Chair Moreno-Cortes, Jose (University of South Florida) and Christian Wells (University of South Florida) [65] The Everyday Relevance of Cultural Patrimony and Heritage in the Naco Valley, Honduras The Instituto Hondureño de Antropología e Historia has enriched our understanding of cultural patrimony and heritage in Honduras by

embracing a multiethnic perspective of the past. But in what ways and to what extent does this understanding have social and economic relevance in the everyday lives of contemporary Hondurans, especially those residing alongside prehispanic ruins in rural areas? The research discussed in this paper explores perceptions about patrimony and heritage in the Naco Valley region of northwest Honduras to better evaluate municipal, department, and federal efforts toward community-based participatory preservation and conservation of archaeological remains. Morgan, Brooke (Southern Methodist University), Brad Koldehoff (Illinois Transportation Archaeological Research Program) and Daniel S. Amick (Loyola University) [146] Clovis Land Use Patterns in the Midwest: Evidence from the Mueller-Keck Site Complex The Mueller and Keck Clovis sites are located in Southwestern Illinois in the uplands along the American Bottom and occupy a shared landform. Repeated collections since the 1970s have yielded several hundred Clovis tools and waste flakes made primarily from exotic Attica chert, located 350 km to the east in west-central Indiana. Recent field and laboratory investigations document spatial patterning and context of Clovis artifacts at this complex. Though the potential for intact buried deposits is unlikely, the assemblage size and abundant non-local raw material provide critical information for evaluating models of Clovis colonization and land use in the midcontinent.

Using core/flake quartz technology, sporadic human occupation of the plateau began perhaps as early as 100 kya. Intensified settlement of previously occupied sites and exploitation of new landscapes using bipolar quartz shatter technology developed during a warm/wet interval (MIS3) between 60 and 30 kya, after which the area saw significant depopulation and sporadic use during the Last Glacial Maximum. Later, Terminal Pleistocene/Early Holocene adaptations shifted dramatically towards an intensive hunter-gatherer adaptation focused on microlithic technology. Morgan, Joelle (University of Oklahoma) [235] Specialized Agriculture in the Prehistoric Casas Grandes Region Agricultural specialization is present in the emergence of many hierarchies. This idea that this type of economic specialization was a factor in the development of intermediate polities is examined through an analysis of the regional differences in the Casas Grandes region, one of the premier polities in the U.S. Southwest and northern Mexico. The results of the analysis of the first modern assemblage of plant remains for near Casas Grandes are discussed in relation to specialized agricultural production and anthropogenic ecology. These works complements recent work that documents the integral role plants played in Casas Grades tradition and political dynamics. Morgan, Michele [235] see LeBlanc, Steven A.

Morin, Eugene (Trent University) [16] Diet Breadth in the early Upper Paleolithic of France This paper examines the evidence for changes in diet breadth during the emergence of the Upper Paleolithic in France. Data from SaintCésaire, the Grotte du Renne at Arcy-sur-Cure, and other sites are not consistent with the hypothesis of a diet breadth expansion. These findings have implications for our understanding of the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition. Morin, Jesse (University of British Columbia) [108] Near Infrared Spectroscopy and the Trade and Exchange of Nephrite/Jade Celts in the Pacific Northwest Nephrite jade was a preferred material for the production of celts both in the form of small wood working tools and very large prestige objects in the Pacific Northwest from about 3000 BP to contact. Using a portable non-destructive near-infrared spectrometer, I have analyzed the mineralogy of more than one thousand such artifacts. The spatial patterns of distribution of small and large nephrite celts, and sawn nephrite cores are markedly divergent. Nephrite celts were traded and exchanged within a 400 km radius of primary production zones located along the Mid-Fraser and Fraser Canyon. Morin, Jesse [84] see Matson, R. G.

Understanding Impacts of GIS Approaches on Archaeological Research Archaeological investigation has been heavily affected by spatial technologies such as GIS. Although GIS and related approaches provide researchers with useful applications, there are problems. Failure to properly integrate spatial technologies potentially harms our knowledge foundation. Ongoing dialogue is necessary to discuss and understand the relationship between GIS and archaeological spatial approaches and define proper applications of the technology in archaeological investigation to ensure that the technology is properly applied. This paper investigates GIS approaches to archaeological research and seeks to understand how the program is changing how archaeologists deal with spatial data and the problems associated with current integration. [117] Second Chair [117] Second Organizer Morrison, Alex (University of Hawaii, Manoa) [127] Mapping the Structure of Communities: Landscape Scale Analysis of Community Organization, Rapa Nui, Chile A central goal of many archaeological research projects is to develop a framework for explaining the evolution of complex community organization. However, researchers studying the archaeological record must begin by developing a concrete definition of "community" and then use appropriate analytical methods for documenting community structure. A landscape scale analysis is necessary for understanding the articulation between social organization and characteristics of the natural environment. This paper provides a working definition of community and then outlines an approach for mapping "communities" across the landscape of Rapa Nui, Chile. Methods highlighted include geo-spatial statistical techniques and multi-spectral satellite imagery. Morrison, Alex [153] see Stark, Miriam T.

[11] Separate Histories, Separate Archaeologies: a Political Ecology of Foraging, Farming, and Rule in South Asia In South Asian historical research, agrarian histories and forest histories are generally quite distinct, while the archaeological division of labor between the study of hunter-gatherers, settled agriculturalists, and states is even more distinct. In this paper, I outline some aspects of the political ecology of food and organic trade goods in South Asia -- from rice and millets to cotton, spices, wood, camphor, and dyes -- that linked these disparate worlds.

However, the neo-evolutionistic and normative principles encapsulated in this concept fail to recognize important aspects of socio-political interaction on a local level. This paper proposes a maison-perspective, a concept introduced by Levi-Strauss, as an alternative that emphasizes social interaction, kinship, and social identity. The maison-perspective applies a practice-oriented approach to local social organizations on the islands and focuses specifically on how people maintain, organize, and manipulate social relations within the existing socio-political framework before the arrival of Columbus in the Caribbean archipelago. Mortensen, Lena (University of Toronto Scarborough) [65] Patrimony, Popular Imagination, and Shifting Visions of Archaeological Pasts in Honduras In popular imagination the Honduran past is commonly reduced to but a few well-known sites, figures, and tropes. In recent years IHAH has worked to counter this trend with new initiatives to broaden the public vision of the past, and actively engage citizens in a recalibrated sense of national patrimony. These efforts involve expanding the archaeological tourism sector, a primary mode for experiencing patrimony which also raises particular sets of complications. In this presentation I discuss some of these complications, and reflect on both the challenges and opportunities of shifting the popular archaeological vision of place in Honduras. Morton, Shawn (University of Calgary), Gabriel Wrobel (University of Mississippi), Joshua Lynch (University of Mississippi) and Rebecca Shelton (AR Consultants, Inc.) [99] Ritual Circuits and Subterranean Material Assemblages in the Caves Branch River Valley, Belize Ritual circuits are well attested in the ethnographic and ethnohistoric records of Mesoamerica. Such circuits have been interpreted as prominent components of the ritual stable of past populations as well. In the Maya area, and in the Classic Period in particular, circuits have been suggested to be ubiquitous ritual features supporting social incorporation, political aggrandizement and accession. In this paper we employ such ritual circuits as explanatory frameworks for the material record encountered in caves and rockshelters in the Caves Branch River Valley, Belize, and tie these rituals to regional shifts in population size and political complexity.

Kit`n`Kaboodle Cave, Alaska Mike Glassow has built an important legacy in the study of shell middens. On the Northwest Coast of North America, most shell middens located along estuaries are dominated by clams (such as Saxidomus, Protothaca, etc.), while those on the outer coast are dominated by mussels (Mytilus californianus). At Kit`n`Kaboodle Cave in southeast Alaska, barnacles are unusually abundant. This paper will present data from Kit`n`Kaboodle Cave within the larger geographic context to more closely examine patterns of barnacle use by First Nations of the Pacific Northwest. While the dietary importance of barnacles is recognized in other parts of the world, particularly Europe, indigenous use of barnacles on the Pacific coast is not well-documented.

What impact did these events have on the archaeology of the 1980s and how was archaeology portrayed during this decade? With the release of the first three Indiana Jones movies and Clan of the Cave Bear it seems somewhat clear that both archaeologists and the past continued to be portrayed in a less than realistic fashion. And, was this the decade where we began to realize that the US could also collapse? Did archaeology gain more relevance because of a renewed concern with the environment? Mountain, Rebecca (Boston University) and Ksenija Borojevic (Boston University) [151] Preliminary Analysis of Fiber Source from Ancient Cordage Ancient cordage discovered in a cave at a Near Eastern maritime site is examined. The cordage was well preserved due to the arid conditions of the site, and could potentially reveal important information about seafaring technology of the period. In order to determine what type of plant was used to construct the cordage the sample fibers were examined using light microscopy, thin section analysis, and scanning electron microscopy. These analyses allowed for detailed comparison of our sample to previously identified plants native to the region in antiquity allowing for a high degree of confidence in the final plant identification.

Mueller, Jenn (Alpine Archaeological Consultants, Inc. RPA) [111] The Long Knife Site (5MF5827): A Shoshone Occupation on the Fringe The Long Knife Site (5MF5827) is a shallow archaeological site with evidence for two Protohistoric components, one of which is a Shoshonean occupation. This occupation represents one of the southernmost Shoshonean sites in western Colorado, located south of the ethnographically indicated boundary between the Ute and the Shoshone. The Shoshonean component is the primary occupation, dating between 490-320 cal years B.P. Despite the absence of structural remains, it is a winter camp. Feature clusters allow for the inference of households or hearth groups, and an estimated population of 12 to 24 individuals. Because of its age and cultural affiliation, the large and diverse assemblage at the Long Knife site offers a rare opportunity to address Ute/Shoshonean border politics, Shoshonean group dynamics and resource use. The second component indicates a series of repeated reoccupations in the form of short term camping events occurring between 300-150 years cal B.P., which offers the chance to consider how oral history and landscape memory may structure resource use and site reoccupation. Muenzel, Susanne (University of Tuebingen) and Michael Hofreiter (University of York, UK) [157] Mammalian Fauna and Human Adaptations from the Aurignacian of the Swabian Jura The main game species represented in the rich Aurignacian faunal assemblages of the Ach Valley include not only mammoth, horse and reindeer, but occasionally cave bears, who hibernated in the caves of the Swabian Jura and who were hunted, as butchering marks and a projectile point in a cave bear vertebra demonstrate. This study integrates an analysis of bone assemblages from Hohle Fels and Geißenklösterle with a study of cave bear population genetics to investigate seasonality, subsistence strategy and changing animal populations during the Paleolithic of southwestern Germany. Mullane, Elizabeth (Stanford University) [73] Megaliths, Mounds, and Monuments: Applying Self-Organizing Theory to Ancient Human Systems The theory of self-organization was developed in physics and has been applied successfully to biological systems. In human groups, self-organizing systems theory can be used to understand how some traditions and practices within a culture may be implemented, changed, and maintained without direct leadership. Three archaeological case studies are the core of this analysis: Megalithic South India, the Middle Mississippi River Valley, and Roman Britain. I examine these three case studies to identify the nature of human interactions, understand how local practices can generate large-scale societal changes, and determine the role of self-organization in the creation of sociopolitical complexity.

Metric dimensions of the bifaces and the production strategy used to make them is very similar to that documented at Clovis sites throughout the West. However, large, well-made bifaces have also been recovered from Woodland sites in the Midwest and Late Prehistoric sites on the Great Plains.

Diversity analysis of the rich Upper Paleolithic-Mesolithic faunal series reveals a complex history of diet diversification and a dramatic shift from strictly terrestrial to marineterrestrial foraging. Human meat diets diversified dramatically with time, first with respect to terrestrial resources as large game diversity diminished and small mammals and bird diversity increased, and subsequently a marine trajectory that began with high-yield littoral sources and expanded to include costly fishing ventures on the open sea.

Leporids occupy small territories (ca. 500 ha) and have short lives (<3 years). Their collagen reflects local, short-term vegetation conditions, and change in collagen values can track ecological shifts at these fine-grained scales. Hunter-gatherers adapt to these local, short-term ecological shifts. While large numbers of analyses are needed, shifts in collagen values from several Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric sites in Central/South Texas and other regions suggests that fine-grained ecological reconstructions may be possible through the analysis of leporid collagen.

Combining information about cranial modification style and nonmetric morphological traits from a skeletal sample interred at the Rio Muerto site cluster, this study investigates the ways in which Tiwanaku colonists in the Moquegua Valley defined themselves relative to other members of the diaspora to forge distinct systems of social organization and community identity. Results suggest that colonial Tiwanaku populations in Moquegua either descended from distinct parent populations or diverged in the peripheral setting through the creation of new social identities and boundaries among migrant groups.

Early historic maps, which contain information from ethnographic documents, oral testimonies, and ethnographic descriptions, can provide texts to aid archaeological interpretations. These texts can also provide information about the processes of human adaptation, which is the ultimate goal of archaeology. The reoccurrence of distinctive geographic features and geological formations suggests landscape familiarity and pre-adaption in human migration patterns. Nagy, Andras [62] see Tankersley, Kenneth B.

B.P.) visible. The technological characteristics of the Younger Dryas assemblages are observed both among the technocomplexes of Upper Paleolithic (ca. 35,000 ­ 13,000 B.P.) and those of the incipient Jomon (ca. 13,000-9800 B.P.): potteries and projectile points invented (or adopted) by the Jomon hunter-gatherers are often associated with Upper Paleolithic tool classes such as stone axes, bifaces, and various unifacial tools. The goal of this paper is to evaluate adaptive strategies of the Younger Dryas hunter-gatherers through an examination of interassemblage variability. Nash, Carole (James Madison University) [59] The Civilian Conservation Corps and the Archaeology of the Recent Past in Virginia Civilian Conservation Corps camps were intended as temporary communities. Despite the passage of only seventy years since occupation, the archaeological documentation of these transitory resources that fall between recorded history and remembered events

proves difficult. In contrast to excavation-based strategies, auxiliary methods of remote sensing, GPS, GIS, repeat photography, and oral history are necessary to the proper study of these resources. In Virginia, where over a quarter-million young men worked out of 175 CCC camps to shape public lands, archaeological testing has demonstrated profound spatial relationships between work, domestic, and recreation areas, illustrating a tension inherent in the quasimilitary camp organization. Nash, Robert (University of California, Davis) [120] Maize Storage and Hunting among Northern Periphery Fremont Groups Originally designated the Northern Periphery of the Southwest, the Fremont culture is today considered distinct. Red Canyon Fremont groups, living at the northern fringe of agricultural expansion, were the northern periphery of the Northern Periphery. The presence of high-elevation sites, including storage features, in the northeastern Uinta Mountains raises the question of whether maize had the same role among people on the northern periphery of the Fremont as it did among the rest of the Fremont. I argue the Red Canyon Fremont used maize for tactical purposes in order to maintain foraging efficiency by prolonging access to high-ranked resources. Nash, Stephen (Denver Museum of Nature & Science) [59] Gender-Role Reversals, Big Digs, and Myriad Exhibitions: New Deal Archaeology at the Field Museum The Great Depression hit Chicago and the Field Museum during an important transition period in their respective histories. The Field Museum sought to move beyond collecting for its own sake and to engage in more scientifically oriented archaeological research. In 1933, Chicago hosted a World`s Fair and chose to emphasize A Century of Progress since its founding, not its Phoenix-like rise from the ashes of the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The Field Museum benefited greatly from New Deal programs; this paper examines their impact on the institution, the city, and on museum anthropology in general.

Public education and outreach have been essential to the success of the project from the start. Various stakeholders are recognizing the potential benefits and consequences of site investigation, heritage tourism, and a partnership with a large state university. The future of public involvement in the project and the lessons to be learned are dependent upon our ability to identify common ground in which archaeology serves as a metaphor for the discovery and recovery of our collective past.

Recently, it has become clear territories are a more complicated social phenomenon. By providing both a historical review of archaeological attempts to identify territories and direction for future studies this piece attempts to reposition, ever so slightly, research on territories as bounded spaces by emphasizing the study of borders.

[73] Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis of Midwestern Ceramics In Great Lakes` archaeology, Bell Type II pottery has been associated with, or proposed as representing the presence of, an historic tribe at archaeological sites dating to the contact through middle historic periods (A.D. 1610-1730). Recent systematic ceramic assemblage reviews identified far fewer specimens of Bell Type II pottery than previously proposed. Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) was performed on select associated ceramics and clays, defining six compositional groups. The groups differ in their affiliation with either Wisconsin or Michigan clays. Combined with more qualitative morphological analyses, INAA data suggest intriguing relationships amongst morphologically similar and dissimilar ceramics.

Given the transitional and precarious nature of the time period - both politically and economically ­ indications of non-elite ritual engagement at a principle public shrine provide tantalizing clues for how ordinary citizens of primary sites like Waka` may have been attempting to adapt and respond to events unfolding around them in ways not previously considered.

In a session celebrating the lives of pioneering women in archaeology, this paper looks more generally at the particular and important contributions that women make and have made to the discipline of archaeology.

Sometimes the analytical data play little more than a supporting role in the construction of stories about the past. There are some examples, however, in which statements about the past have been framed in such a way that they make clear predictions about patterning expected in analytical data. In these cases, the analyses lead to falsification, the sine qua non of scientific explanation. [126] Discussant Neff, Hector [251] see Hill, Mark A.

We found that freshwater fish from the Danube was the main protein source in the Mesolithic period but was not heavily exploited in the Neolithic. We use these results to demonstrate the effects of two different dietary sources on sulphur isotope values and the implications for our understanding of ancient diets.

We use this idea to examine variation in the importance of internal markets and its archaeological consequences among slave societies of the Caribbean in the eighteenth and early nineteenth-centuries. We compare artifact assemblages from slave village sites in Jamaica and Nevis, focusing on the extent to which historically documented variation in the scale of internal markets explains variation in the production and consumption of locally-made earthenware and levels of access to costly European consumer goods, especially ceramics.

Legions of archaeologists have studied virtually all aspects of these societies, and the results have in turn been the basis for a series of Hohokam ­ Chacoan comparisons. One topic that has received relatively little attention is Hohokam ­ Chacoan interaction.

La Quemada, Zacatecas, Mexico, affords opportunities to understand such materialization of social identity and memory; Wixárika (Huichol) people today still build tukipa groups, containing a temple plus other buildings related to its periodic use, as well as the associated patio. We argue that the prehispanic centers of the region were essentially collections of tukipa groups plus a higher-order, public component that does not exist today and represented a regional level of integration.

That diversity in southwest New Mexico stands in stark contrast to the previous Mimbres tradition, dominated by a single ceramic and architectural form and village structure. How does such diversity develop at various scales -- village, local, and regional? What does it represent about movement, integration, and exchange? To begin addressing these questions, I explore the ceramic diversity evident at various scales throughout southwest New Mexico from the 13th through 15th centuries.

Recent archaeological research within the American west has perpetuated the notion of enlarged diet breadth of hunter-gatherer groups during the Early Holocene, as evidenced by increased faunal diversity, especially of small game, and the incorporation of grinding stone technology. However, faunal and groundstone data from the earliest occupations at North Creek Shelter, a multi-component upland site on the Colorado Plateau of south-central Utah, suggest that small-seed processing flourished after ~9000 BP but not to compensate for a lack of or even reduction in high-rank resources, as Early Archaic occupants continued to focus predominately on large game hunting on par with their Paleoarchaic forbears.

Newby, Paige (Brown University) [224] Changing Conditions during the Younger Dryas Interval in Northeastern North America The Younger Dryas climate oscillation (12.9-11.6 ka; YD) impacted a widespread area that includes New England and Maritime Canada (NEM). Advances in knowledge about regional conditions during the YD indicate a dynamic post-glacial landscape. Detailed paleorecords from southern New England, which show intermittent drought and localized changes in vegetation, present information at scales of interaction most useful to archaeologists.

TP/EH foragers generally used obsidian to make stemmed points (hunting gear) and chert for other tools (resourceprocessing gear). And while obsidian artifacts have seen decades of analyses, the location of chert sources and the organization of chert technology remain relatively unknown in the Great Basin. I argue that an analysis of source provenance and technological organization of chert artifacts may delineate complementary scales of mobility and modes of resource acquisition to that documented for obsidian.

We combined different sampling strategies to conduct microstratigraphic (thin sections), microartifact and plant anatomical analyses of two burned structures at the Berry site. Structures 1 and 5 are intensively mapped and excavated to garner a more complete understanding of building construction, activity areas, and taphonomic processes. Oak was a preferred construction material but other woods appear to have been selected for secondary construction elements and as fuel. Food processing may explain the presence of certain microartifacts and fragmentary nutshell. Masses of graminoid stems likely represent original thatch and floor matting, whereas fern stems may relate to localized activities. Newton, Cody (University of Colorado @ Boulder) [111] Were those Bricks Possessed of Tongues: An Examination of the Unusual Trading Post Concentration on the South Platte River, 1837-1838 This paper analyzes the unusual trading post concentration ­ Fort Vasquez, Fort Jackson, Fort Lupton, and Fort St. Vrain ­ that operated simultaneously along the South Platte River during the late 1830s. These posts traded almost exclusively in bison robes provided by Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho hunters. Previous explanations have oversimplified the reasons for this concentration of trade by largely ignoring indigenous instrumentality and ecological factors. Heretofore unexamined environmental data combined with research into intertribal conflict provides a more holistic explanation for this unique conjuncture.

The location fostered early development of irrigation farming that has persisted in the area for more than 3,200 years. Multiple periods of differing flood regimes resulted in rapid deposition of floodplain sediments. Individual strata are distinct in texture, color, and mineralogy and are unusually consistent over a large area. These conditions and characteristics have allowed the identification of hundreds of individual fields and borders and more than 160 canals and water distribution features representing nearly a millenium of farming at the site.

Nicodemus, Amy (University of Michigan) [149] Animal Production Strategies and Exchange Networks in the Maros Region During the Early to Middle Bronze Age, communities along the Maros River developed different organizational systems, from small autonomous villages to larger tell-centered societies. These groups participated differentially in long distance trade networks, in part predicated by community size and location. However, equally important was the ability to produce sufficient and reliable quantities of surplus goods for exchange. In this region lacking mineral resources, agricultural goods, especially livestock and their products, were important export commodities. Comparison of the animal economies between autonomous villages and central tell settlements highlights the distinctive production strategies employed in these contrasting systems.

[167] First Organizer; [167] Second Chair Nielsen, Colin (McGill University) [60] Identifying Interactions on Prehistoric Eastern James Bay through Ceramic Sourcing Distinguishing between types of interactions eludes a comprehensive methodology despite the substantial differences each interaction type entails for the interpretation of the archaeological record. FeGj-t2 on Eastern James Bay contained a ceramic sherd incised with a diagonal linear pattern similar to Huron types from south-western Ontario. Using INAA analysis we test whether these ceramics were of local or imported raw materials. Local materials with a Huron style indicates cultural diffusion or coincidental independent innovation. A non-local source indicates exchange or the movement of people. While INAA reduces the options, there still remains no unambiguous means of identifying specific interaction types.

Nearby contemporaneous sites include small artifact scatters or camps, larger artifact scatters interpreted to be domestic sites, and mounds -- traditionally considered the focus of mortuary ceremonialism and ritual activity. Drawing on this settlement data, this paper explores Middle Woodland community organization in the Whitewater River Basin.

This composite creature often holds a human head or a knife, demonstrating a clear association with decapitation rituals. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to examine the relationship between representations of the Mythical Killer Whale in ceramics and in the rock art of the Nasca Valley, and to explore this figure`s shark attributes. Nigra, Benjamin (University of Chicago), Hans Barnard (UCLA) and Rodolfo Talavera Zuniga [188] Structural Patterning at Millo II in the Southern Huari Periphery Millo II, located in the Vitor Valley south of Arequipa, Peru, presents a unique urban layout that sheds light on architectural patterning in the Huari periphery. Structural remains at this site display a variety of typical Huari features, including irregular stone and mud mortar construction and orthogonal planning. As has been proposed for sites in the nearby Cotahuasi Valley, however, the layout of Millo II does not appear to be directly comparable to other periphery sites such as Pikillacta or Viracochapampa (Jennings and Alvarez 2001). Architectural patterning at Millo II thus offers new insights into Huari influence south of Arequipa.

One of the critical questions is when does bladelet technology occur in the archaeological record? The goal of this paper is to answer this question for the Middle Danube region. After defining criteria for the presence/absence of bladelet technology, the evidence from a lithic analysis of Bohunician, Szeletian, and Early Aurignacian

assemblages of key sites in the Middle Danube region is presented. Based on this evidence it is argued that bladelet technology does not appear before the Aurignacian.

This paper discusses the stable isotope analysis of two rural Italian populations, from the Imperial Roman site of Casal del Dolce, and the early medieval cemetery at S.

Although LA-ICP-MS has seldom been used for research in Southeast Asia, it has provided promising results regarding the role of craft specialization in the political and economic expansion of the prehispanic trading polity of Tanjay (A.D. 500 to 1600) in the Philippines.

Recently, faunal identification and analysis has been conducted on some of the early archaeological remains at Jamestown, providing concrete data on the animals that were consumed during the provisioning crisis. Comparisons can now be made between the 1607-1610 time period and the second quarter of the 17th century regarding the diversity of meats consumed in order to demonstrate just how unusual the Starving Time meat diet may have been. Aside from the temporal comparison between periods at Jamestown, a locational comparison is made between Jamestown and the 16201635 settlement at Jordan`s Journey, also located on the James River.

Food supplies, both imported and procured from the local environment, played a predominant role in the outcomes of fishing ventures. Integration of zooarchaeological, archaeological and historical evidence will provide a more complete and broader portrait of fishermen`s food consumption from the 17th to the 19th centuries. Historical and archaeological evidence also shows that food consumption was clearly delineated among the crewmembers of lower and higher status, both spatially and socially.

Noll, Christopher (Plateau Archaeological Investigations) [147] The Development of Lithic Extraction Areas in the Okanogan Highlands During the Late Holocene: Evidence From Curlew Lake, Washington Recent excavations in the Okanogan Highlands have identified an extraction area at a fine grained volcanic source associated with alluvial chert deposits. The development of this site occurred after approximately 3,500 BP, during a time when the use of high quality stone increased at sites in the region. High quality stone use has been interpreted as a sign of increased mobility and group interaction that resulted in access to these materials from other regions. The Curlew Lake lithics suggest that intensified foraging away from the Columbia River may have increased knowledge of, and access to, relatively local high quality stone.

Norman, Neil (William and Mary) [64] Pythons in Process: An Archaeology Animals and Socio-Political Dynamics in the Bight of Benin Region, 1650-1727 A.D. The international coastal trading entrepôt of Ouidah is infamous as the point of embarkation for hundreds of thousands of people spirited into the Middle Passage. Accordingly, scholars have looked to conflict between three kingdoms in the region--Allada, Dahomey, and Hueda--as a struggle over this economic outlet into the Atlantic World. This paper explores animals and animal metaphors imbedded within the socio-political dynamics that led to unprecedented warfare and consolidation in the early 18th century AD. Norman, Vernal G.

[99] 2012 End Date?--Izapa Stela 5 World Tree Ages Izapa Stela 5 World Tree history (Norman, Izapa Sculpture 1976:199212, Fig. 4-12) has been decoded to a 6500 year time scale with features at 500-year increments. Stela 5's tree plus Stela 12 reveals Izapan pre-Mayan history and calendars. The time scale is composed geometrically with standard measure. It runs from a creation base path line at the roots, projected at 3114 B.C., up the tree trunk path line to the top broken trunk line at 2087 A.D. (solar calendar). Two Stela 12 dates, and the 5 World Ages, with scaled dates on the trunk, are fixed to their adjacent numbered signs with 4 Earthquake ending the 5th Age at 2087 A.D. rather than 2012 A.D.

This study conducts a palynological analysis of turkey droppings found at a Basketmaker II site that were previously analyzed genetically in order to reconstruct the birds' diets and explore evidence for their domestication. Using additional palynological and molecular analysis of 11 coprolites, this study further explores turkey domestication during Basketmaker II at Turkey Pen Ruins. Preliminary results of palynological analysis display over 20 plant taxa with detectable differences in diet and seasonal occupation at the site. Nott, BreAnne [19] see Bocinsky, R. Kyle

Morgan (Southern Methodist University) [200] Make it Hot, Hot, Hot: Experiments in Thermal Efficiency of Micaceous Clay Cookware Primary micaceous clay with super-abundant levels of mica is found in high-elevation Precambrian formations in northern New Mexico. This clay has remarkable thermal and physical properties that make it an excellent cookware, and it has been widely used for cooking in the Northern Rio Grande and elsewhere in New Mexico since AD 1300. According to traditional potters, important properties of mica clay include increased resistance to mechanical and thermal shock and enhanced heating efficiency due to high concentrations of mica. This poster examines the effects of surface treatment, wall thickness, and mica abundance on the thermal efficiency of experimental pots. O'Brien, Matthew (University of New Mexico), Bruce B.

Variation in Folsom Mobility Patterns in the Middle Rio Grande Basin of New Mexico Recent University of New Mexico excavations explored Boca Negra Wash and Deann`s Site­two single component Folsom sites located near Albuquerque, New Mexico. Based on identified raw material source locations, toolstone frequencies indicate that the Boca Negra Wash site is dominated by materials from the north (an I-25 approach to the site) while the Deann`s Site assemblage contains materials from the west (an I-40 path to the site). These patterns suggest that regional mobility exhibits greater complexity than originally believed. We discuss these ideas in the context of existing models and weigh their significance for understanding Folsom land use.

En San Vicente de Nicoya se ha generado un proceso de gestión participativa del patrimonio cultural a través del Ecomuseo de la Cerámica Chorotega. Mediante una propuesta educativa y de animación se ha facilitado la construcción de conocimientos, que permite a los pobladores generar una investigación de su pasado precolombino y de su memoria colectiva. Para ello se desarrolla una capacitación en temas arqueológicos paralela a un proyecto participativo de investigación en historia oral, que conlleva a un guión de exhibición museográfica. En esta ponencia se hace un balance de la experiencia metodológica y de los resultados obtenidos. O'Day, Karen (University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire) [260] Reconstructing Jewelry Sets in the Isthmo-Colombian Area Ancient Paracas garments and contemporary powwow regalia: these are just two examples of cohesive sets of body ornamentation in the Americas. Despite the well-known examples, ornamentation tends to generate research that examines one type of ornamentation (e.g. pendants) or multiple types sharing a motif. Yet data exist about sets, even those created in antiquity. The paper raises the following question: what is possible in the reconstruction of sets documented by archaeological site reports? This question is investigated with data about jewelry excavated at the Sitio Conte necropolis in Panama. O'Donovan, Maria (Public Archaeology Facility) and Nina Versaggi (Public Archaeology Facility) [180] Commemorating the Past through Visual Representations: A Case Study from Binghamton`s Urban Core Public Archaeology Facility excavations on a historic-prehistoric site in the urban City of Binghamton offered opportunities for creative avenues of community outreach, including both educational and commemorative projects. Archaeologists worked with building designers, collaborated with Native American artists, joined with a major regional museum, and are proposing interpretive signage along an adjacent river walk as part of a suite of visual representations of the region`s past. In this paper, we will discuss these efforts that go beyond the brochure, including the audiences they reach, and how we can encourage more community participation in the commemoration of the region`s past. O'Gorman, Jodie (Michigan State University) [140] After the Moment Passed The Moorehead Moment had implications for eastern North American societies well beyond Cahokia, and the dynamics of these relationships were not insignificant to stability of the chiefdom. Development and remarkable spread of Oneota societies around A.D. 1200 to 1300 are examined in light of environmental and political factors related to the end of the Moorehead Moment at Cahokia. Particular attention is given to Oneota interaction and non-interaction with Mississippian groups.

These assumptions will be examined in the context of anthropological theories of frontiers, social boundaries, technological style, and the materialization of identity. Domestic and ritual architecture, projectile points and lithic technology, and decorated and plainware pottery are used to compare and contrast Virgin and Kayenta Puebloan material culture and social organization. Rather than peripheral and derivative, the unique trajectory of Virgin Puebloan culture is shown to have been creatively constructed by sharing, adapting, or re-defining material expressions and social ideas.

Through fieldwork and artifact analysis, patterns of craft production and trade are being reconstructed to help evaluate models of political and economic interaction associated with the wider spread of the Aztatlán phenomenon. Excavations in 2008 yielded data from offerings, architecture, and evidence of human sacrifice that provide an opportunity to explore aspects of religious ideology that were embodied not only at ancient Chacalilla, but that were manifested more widely throughout prehispanic Mesoamerica and persist among modern indigenous groups of west Mexico.

In this paper, we assess Browman's approach to Formativeperiod stone-carving in light of recent data from the southern Titicaca Basin, including the stone stelae from the site of Khonkho Wankane. We find his analyses especially valuable for understanding chronological development, and focus particularly on his criteria for categorizing and seriating variation in the style of stelae throughout the period.

We used Chinese, Islamic, and Imitation trade ceramics to test broader socio-economic processes including trade booms, market-capture, outsourcing, and competition in the market place. The results enabled us to understand and place in proper context, how: (a) Indian Ocean merchants adapted to change, (b) Chinese merchants countered imitative production of Celadon and Blue-and-White, and (c) Indian merchants and producers in Western India successfully imitated and gradually took-over production and distribution of Middle Eastern and North African Islamic glazed ware.

[196] "These Are Not My Ancestors, but Look What I Found In My Field": Engaging with Non-Descendant Communities in Northern Belize In Latin America archaeology is likely to take place where residents identify as mestizo, or as citizens of their nation-states, rather than any Indigenous ethnicity. While such residents may not identify with the people being excavated, they are nonetheless stakeholders in the archaeological process. In this paper I explore some challenges to public archaeology efforts in non-descendant communities, recounting my experiences working in northern Belize villages. Residents of these villages have no heritage connection to the Maya archaeological remains that our project has excavated. Moreover, academic archaeology is not historically structured to include nondescendant community members. Oldroyd, Ann (University of Exeter) [256] Learning at the Gault Site, Texas: Studying Skill-Level in a NonRefitted Bifacial Assemblage The Gault site has an incredible wealth of Clovis flaked stone artefacts, spanning all phases of manufacture. It seems an ideal site to study for evidence of learning and expertise in Clovis point production but attempts to refit the material have failed, meaning that established methodologies cannot be used. Comparing flakes and bifaces from the Gault site to an experimental analog, Ann is developing a methodology to distinguish between different levels of expertise within non-refitted material. Reducing reliance on refitting means many more sites can be investigated and will make it possible to study broad trends on an inter-site basis. Olinger, Colleen (Otowi Station Science Museum), Anastasia Steffen (Valles Caldera National Preserve) [41] A Fragile Union of Nature and Culture: Aspen Dendroglyphs in the Valles Caldera National Preserve Aspen carvings left by sheepherder, logger, hunter, or passer-by contain an information payload. These dendroglyphs reveal family names, hometowns, and when the carver was there; they speak of the carver`s occupation, religion, ethnicity, and sometimes their loneliness and dreams. These otherwise unreported narratives of early 20th century mountain communities allow the carvers to speak for themselves. Today, threats to this resource (weathering, elk, fire, disease, and aspen senescence) are steadily reducing the storied arbors. We report on the 1st two seasons of the VCNP volunteer dendroglyph inventory program, including both results to-date and future plans for this productive program.

[229] The Classic Maya East-West Transversal Exchange Route in Lithics and Exotics: Patterns, Complexities, and Changes in Late Classic Interregional Political Economy One of the most important exchange routes of the PreColumbian Maya world, the transversal route, runs east to west along the northern base of the Maya highlands at the highland/Peten contact zone. It was a major direct exchange route from the Caribbean to Mexico and across Chiapas. Yet this route, its exchange system, and its many sites have never been studied. Ongoing projects at transversal sites such as Sebol, Raxruja Viejo, La Linterna, and others are beginning to explore this route and are revealing its importance in Classic Maya political economy and in the apogees and declines of Maya states.

This paper assumes that the ceramic seals are related to trade practices. Based on design studies and paste provenience analysis, the taxonomic groups of glyptic artifacts are able to reveal important data about cultural affiliation, gremial organizations and trade routes.

These highly stylized sculptures follow a sophisticated naturalistic tradition of figural sculpture in the region. Moreover, earlier figural sculptures clearly distinguish sex; while the peg-base statues blur sex and gender indicators, such as physical attributes and costuming. The individuals represented in the peg-base sculptures are also frequently shown with zoomorphic and other nonhuman traits. This paper explores these characteristics of dress and physicality in this group of artworks, and their ideological underpinnings.

Ossa, Alanna [254] Economic Organization of a Postclassic Center and its Hinterlands in Veracruz, Mexico I analyze residential inventories from the center of Sauce and its hinterlands to address the possible appearance of markets and the structure of exchange during the Middle Postclassic period (AD 12001350) in south-central Veracruz, Mexico. Since ancient economies typically had multiple exchange mechanisms, I evaluate how market exchange fits with elite and kin reciprocities using items from 65 residential units. I apply an explicit analytical method to model the mix of social, political, and commercial factors that shape economic organization. This study addresses the extent of Postclassic commercialization in a region distant from the markets known for the larger states.

According to county records, the land on which Memorial Park sits once belonged to a Lutheran Church, who first used the ground for burials in 1874 and continued to use it as a graveyard until 1875 when the county prohibited any further burials. During this time, burials were often reported as having been moved when, in fact, only tombstones were relocated. The survey I performed was conducted using ground penetrating radar. Through ground truthing I compared my results with magnetometer and electrical resistivity tests conducted in 2006.

(EK Consultores en Arqueología) [116] The Domestication of the Precolonial Caribbean Through the time, the world of plants has been considered as one of the richest natural plots where humans gain caloric/protein benefits for subsistence. In this paper I'm going to show how some Neotropical plants and peoples in the Caribbean islands went beyond this restrictive "energetic input" to jointly create pre-colonial worlds in which plants were, like humans, cultural entities that produced life and established many of the rhythms` of socio-cultural continuity and change. Thus, this was one of the more effective ways used by ancient peoples to domesticate the Caribbean islands since the beginnings of humanity in the region, and also one of the ways that plants used to Caribbeanize people for thousands of years.

Pailes, Matthew (University of Arizona) and Natalia Martinez (University of Arizona) [235] A Discount Rate Approach to Hohokam Agave Cultivation The Early Classic (AD 1150-1300) Hohokam people of the Sonoran Desert made significant infrastructural investments to cultivate agave outside of the plant`s natural range. Despite these investments, agave cultivation ceased in several sub-regions during the Late Classic (AD 1300-1450). This evaluation of kcal return rates indicates agave should be ranked above most other cultivated resources in Hohokam diets. However, due to the risk inherent to the long maturation period of agave, the resource may have been devalued. The perceived level of risk necessary to cause the cessation of agave cultivation is quantified here by the use of discount rates.

Paine, Richard (University of Utah) [241] Using Demographic Models to Test Archaeological Hypotheses: Two Examples from the Classic Considers uses of population models to test hypotheses about prehistoric population processes. Presents case examples, testing hypotheses in the literature of Classic Mesoamerica: 1) migration as a cause of skeletal age profile from Teotihuacan; 2) epidemic disease as a cause of the classic Maya collapse, using the skeletal age distribution from Copan as test. Demographic projections test hypotheses two ways: they help assess the ancient demographic setting (Could hypothesized cause create the proposed historical pattern?); and, they produce age-at-death patterns, which can be compared to skeletal series to test whether the hypothesized pattern could have produced observed age-at-death patterns.

Panich, Lee (University of California Berkeley) [181] Acculturation, Resistance, Ethnogenesis, Persistence: Rethinking the Legacies of Colonial Entanglements for Indigenous Peoples The growing interest of archaeologists in the entanglements between indigenous peoples and European colonialism encourages reflection on the implications of the scholarly interpretation of such encounters for native communities today. In many cases, indigenous identities have persisted despite dramatic changes in land base, social organization, and material culture. By taking a diachronic approach, archaeologists are well suited to situate the continuities and changes of the colonial period within the context of dynamic indigenous cultures and identities. This paper will explore the concept of persistence through the examination of a case study from Mission Santa Catalina, Baja California, Mexico. Panizza, Cecilia [138] see Barrientos, Gustavo Papalas, Christopher (Northland Research, Inc.) [149] Bronze Age Metallurgy in the Eastern Carpathian Basin The Eastern Carpathian Basin is one of the earliest metallurgical centers in the world, and has produced spectacular examples of Bronze Age metal objects. However, it has not generated evidence for the hierarchical control of metal production analogous to Bronze Age contexts in the Near East. This general pattern was first noted by Childe. An increasing body of evidence suggests that metalworking in the region was local, small scale, widespread and extremely ad hoc. Here, the technological sequence of Bronze Age metal production will be modeled using data from Maros (EBA), Ottomány (EBA/MBA) and Gyulavarsánd (MBA) contexts. It is hypothesized that the very widespread but small scale nature of prehistoric metallurgy in this region led to wide experimentation and relatively rapid technological change. This general model fits available data, the long antiquity of metalworking in the basin, and the numerous and diverse ore sources found locally. Pape, W. Kevin (Gray & Pape, Inc.)

Paris, Elizabeth (University at Albany-SUNY) [20] Molding Identity at Mayapan: The Multifaceted Uses of Metal at an Urban Center This paper reviews various ways that metal objects were manipulated in economic, social, and ritual contexts. Metal items were local products and were valued consumer goods. Locally produced and imported metal artifacts also played important roles in displaying and reinforcing social status and wealth. Metals were selectively incorporated in offerings and burials at the city, where they were important offerings to the gods and to the deceased. Patterns of use and acquisition of metals at Mayapan are explored in the context of the city's significant political and economic functions. [20] see France, Elizabeth L. Parish, Ryan (University of Memphis) [236] Exploring the Application of Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy to the Detection of Thermal Alteration in Chert It is a well established phenomenon that prehistoric people often heat treated specific varieties of chert in order to alter the mechanical aspects and or coloration of the material. Traditionally researchers identify the use of this technique by the pink to reddish hues that develop on the surficial aspects of the chert debitage. The macroscopic identification of thermal alteration maybe in error as not all chert types display a reddish hue or can occur naturally in these color variations. The following study explores a non-destructive method of detecting the thermal alteration of chert artifacts using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Parker, Kathryn (Kathryn Parker Archaeobotany) [140] The Cultural Context of Plant Materials from a Mound 34 Moorehead Phase Structure Evidence of the structural elements and contents from the burned building associated with the summit of Mound 34`s primary platform were found redeposited at the junction of the primary mound and surrounding terrace. Initially identified by Perino as ceremonial fires, this paper discusses the carbonized materials recovered from excavations and flotation samples. The analyses indicate that carbonized plant remains from these areas were dominated by bald cypress, red cedar, white oak and hickory, accompanied by low frequencies of robust grass culms. The material identified clearly reflect burned structural debris with little food-related plant remains present.

Parkinson, William (Field Museum of Natural History), Attila Gyucha (Field Service for Cultural Heritage, Hungary), Richard Yerkes (Ohio State University) [61] The Social Dynamics of Emerging Complexity: A Long-Term Perspective on Middle Range Societies in the Prehistoric Carpathian Basin and the Eastern Woodlands While much recent research has emphasized the transition from subsistence systems based on hunting and gathering to more settled agriculture, we examine the long-term social dynamics of emerging complexity in middle-range societies. Using a multi-scalar perspective, we compare the trajectories of Neolithic and Bronze Age societies in the Carpathian Basin with those of Woodland and Late Prehistoric societies in the Eastern Woodlands. By comparing the emergence of social institutions with the organization of households, villages, and regional systems of integration and interaction, we hope to identify patterns of similarity and difference in the emergence of complexity in Temperate Woodland environments. Parks, Shoshaunna (University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill) [196] Public Archaeology: Ethnocentric Conservation or Equitable Promotion of Local Relationships to Heritage? Public archaeologies have become a basic measure of ethical practice. The integration of local and descendent communities into archaeological interpretation and management signals its expansion from past-centric to present-centric approaches. Archaeology`s true ethical impact, however, remains up for interpretation. What is the purpose of public outreach: to provide local communities with knowledge to form their own conclusions about heritage or to encourage them to value ancient places from Western perspectives? Who benefits from archaeological stewardship in ancient landscapes otherwise ideal for subsistence and extant cultural activities? This paper problematizes the ethical implications of public outreach in the Maya region. [159] First Organizer; [159] Discussant Parr, Christopher (Panamerican Consultants, Inc.)

Opting to utilize already-available software rather than purchasing specialized programs (i.e. PastPerfect), this Access-based system, named "Lil'Benny2.0", will allow not only for these necessary operations but also for user-defined queries of the artifacts themselves to better facilitate research of Fort Benning's cultural resources. Parsons, Timothy (Florida State University) [149] Contact and Change: Economic and Social Trajectories on the Great Hungarian Plain ca. 4000-3000 BC Economic relationships within and beyond the Carpathian Basin helped shape the cultural tapestry of the Great Hungarian Plain throughout the region`s prehistory. Throughout the Copper Age, increasing focus was placed on relationships beyond the Plain and is reflected in shifts in settlement organization and material culture. This paper addresses changes during the Middle and Late Copper Age (ca. 4000-3000 BC) through spatial analysis of settlements and a technological approach to ceramic analysis. The relationships between local and foreign players on the Plain were part of a wider economic system, and set the stage for economic relationships during

the Bronze Age. Pasacreta, Laura [120] see Gardner, A. Dudley Pasquariello, Raymond (Gray & Pape, Inc.)

Patalano, Marisa and Heather Trigg (UMass Boston) [246] Paleoethnobotany of Viking-Age Sites in Skagafjordur, Iceland The SASS project`s extensive sampling for botanical materials has recovered numerous macrobotanicals, including crop, weed, and fruit seeds, from Viking-aged sites in Iceland. Seeds from archaeological deposits are commonly interpreted as food, but some seeds recovered here were found in animal dung, probably burnt for fuel. In this paper we analyze the seeds recovered from the dung and compare them to botanical assemblages from house floors and middens to tease apart various activities that contributed the seeds to the archaeological record. Determining sources helps us understand the Viking`s practices including livestock management, building construction, fuel use, and food procurement. Patch, Shawn (New South Associates, Inc.) and Danny Gregory (New South Associates, Inc.) [85] Refining Middle Woodland Site Structure: Ground Penetrating Radar Investigations at Site 40Mi70, Marion County, Tennessee This paper discusses the application of GPR technology to archaeological questions related to the Middle Woodland period in Tennessee. GPR data from a 5.1 acre survey at site 40Mi70 indicate a large number of anomalies. Detailed analysis of 2D reflection traces and 3D cubes, coupled with contextual information about Woodland sites, led to the classification of broad feature classes, including possible burials, hearths, pits, house clusters, and shell middens. Based on the spatial distribution of these anomalies, both horizontally and vertically, interpretations were possible regarding Woodland site structure, land use, and subsistence. These interpretations were subsequently tested through field excavations. Patel, Shankari (University of California Riverside) [107] Geography of Belief: The Iconography of Mesoamerican Cave Pilgrimage Caves and cenotes comprise the religious topography of many Mesoamerican pilgrimage locales. This paper investigates the iconography associated with pilgrimage and caves as depicted in the International art style which flourished throughout Mesoamerica during the Postclassic. Cave denotations were often metaphors for religious transformation legitimating elites' political or economic power and symbolizing commoners' connection to earth and ancestors. Representation of caves also subverted gender ideologies when combined with portrayals of pilgrimage practices. Through an examination of the religious codices, murals, and artifacts associated with this style, this paper highlights the importance of cave imagery to Mesoamerican Postclassic pilgrimage and religion. Patton, Paul (The Ohio State University) [46] Ceramics in Transition: An evolutionary Appraisal of Food Production, Ceramics, and Sedentism in the Hocking Valley, Ohio Throughout the Ohio Valley, archaeologists have used macrocharacteristics of pottery (e.g. vessel wall thickness, temper, surface treatment, surface decoration, etc.) to construct typologies for the purpose of seriation sequencing. The focus on stylistic classification has often obscured the functional aspects of pottery, which were produced to meet requirements of food processing, storage, and transport. This paper utilizes an evolutionary approach to explore

Patton, Paul [30] see Weaver, Sarah A. Pauketat, Timothy (University of Illinois) [15] What's the Big Idea? Cahokia's City Plan and Beyond Cahokia was redesigned as a city around AD 1050, carrying one important pre-Mississippian element into that design but expanding the design field to encompass a region. Cahokia`s plan is cardinal, with variation revealing of formal politico-religious complexities if not also shifting allegiances. Intra-regional complementarities suggest that a large-scale order remains to be fully understood. Sectors of the central complex were probably reserved for religious, secular and elite purposes. At least two outlier complexes built at the same time reveal centrally organized and regionally specialized religious practices that reference solar and lunar events, linked to Cahokia via likely processional avenues.

Variables investigated were the search length; the time between the crime and the start of the search; time between the crime and the time the body was placed in the landfill. The study also included success rate, target size, search method, and body condition. A successful recovery correlates to search length and a shorter timeframe between the crime and the search start. The targets size whether an adult, child or an object of evidence does not correlate to the search`s success.

In contrast, the diet of Spanish missionaries was dependent on the labor of Native converts. Zooarchaeological remains from Missions San Agustín and Cocóspera indicate that wild game contributed significantly to the diet of Spanish missionaries, despite official negative attitudes toward hunting and the consumption of wild game. In many ways, the transformation of the diet of missionaries may have been more profound than that of the missionized. Payne, Claudine (Arkansas Archeological Survey) [115] The Disposal of Heirlooms and the End of Memory at the Lake Jackson Site On the edge of the Mississippian world, at the Lake Jackson site in northwest Florida, copper items appear in abundance in burials from the 13th century into the 15th century. Embossed copper plates were apparently treasured over time and sometimes carefully repaired, only to be disposed of ultimately in burials. Examination of these heirlooms requires careful consideration, buried as they are far distant in time from their manufacture. Burial of heirlooms at Lake Jackson, along with other clues, suggests desperate attempts by their owners to hold onto power and authority in a time of waning connections to the greater Southeast. Paynter, Robert (UMass Amherst) [181] Turning Things into Names and Names into Things: Archaeology and Consequential Entanglements The practice of archaeology is the art and science of naming material

processes, then using intricate logical and emotional connections to construct representations of the past. Our namings, and the imagined social worlds of which they are apart, have consequences for the conduct of archaeology and for our entanglements with other social processes. It is this latter situation where our practice of turning things into names engages the insights of Fricker, the task of this symposium. Two cases, the identification of African American sites and the repatriation of human remains, illustrate some of the social consequences of our archaeological practices. Payton, Susan [166] see Devlin, Sean Peacock, Evan (Mississippi State University) and Barrett Burnworth (Mississippi State University) [88] What are We Saving? A Nationwide Review of Phase I Survey Reports Arguably the most important principle underlying Cultural Resource Management is that of the representative sample. Although most archaeologists agree that the full range of archaeological phenomena must be investigated/preserved, apparent biases exist in what kinds of phenomena are considered significant. We investigate this disconnect between theory and practice by reviewing a random selection of survey reports from several states. We find a ubiquitous bias against small sites with low artifact density in favor of large, highartifact-density sites with intact deposits. The rationales offered for these practices are indefensible in terms of scientific theory, and we offer some suggestions for improvement. [88] First Chair Peacock, Evan [251] see Greenlee, Diana M.

In a funerary assemblage from Xiyasi (476BC-221BC), the number and quality of grave goods varied considerably, as did the scale of the entombments. Testing for correspondence between a number of standard health markers and selected characteristics of the pertinent funerary contexts, we found that individuals from a few ostentatious burials exhibited greater robusticity and lesser development of DJD than expectable for their age. Pederson Weinberger, Jennifer (Hopewell Culture NHP) and Kathleen Brady (National Park Service) [244] An Examination of Settlement Patterns at Two Sites in the Scioto Valley Archaeological research in the Eastern Woodlands, such as conducted by our advisor William Dancey, is greatly focused on the nature of settlement through time. Where and how people lived in Ohio`s Scioto Valley changed significantly from t he Woodland to Late Prehistoric periods. This presentation examines this shift by comparing data collected from the Hopewell Mound Group and the Voss Mound and Village Site.

(Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute) and Todd Grote (Allegheny College) [29] Distribution of Prehistoric Archaeological Sites in the Pennsylvania Lake Erie Watershed Pennsylvania's Lake Erie watershed contains 209 prehistoric archaeological sites registered by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. A crucial determinant in site location appears to be proximity to the well-drained, gravelly and sandy soils developed on former Pleistocene beach ridges --predominantly the Whittlesey and Warren III strands. Geographic information systems software was employed to determine the locations of those geologic features in relation to archaeological site locations. Analysis indicates that an overwhelming majority of the watershed's archaeological sites occur within 1 km (0.6 mi) of these features, which collectively account for only about 15 percent of the watershed's total area.

Recent research has begun to address the shortcomings of this collection as an incomplete sample of the site and as an incomplete sample of the archaeological remains as they actually exist in the ground. The goal of this work is to create a more complete representation of the archaeological remains at Angel site and thereby write a more complete prehistory.

Peelo, Sarah (University of California Davis) [6] (Sometimes) Low Fired Earthenwares, Daily Practice, and Identity: The Production and Reproduction of Indigenous Social Identities in Spanish California Archaeological studies of a ceramic type, commonly termed Colonoware, are frequently used to make interpretations about ethnic identity in the colonial New World. This body of research could benefit from a practice theory approach. Archaeological studies of patterned artifact style, described broadly as that seen at all stages of production (termed chaîne opératoire), including use, has the potential to illuminate how social identities were produced and reproduced through daily social practice. An example from the other side of the New World, from Spanish California, far away from

academic circles in which this pottery is usually discussed, may illustrate this argument. [6] First Chair Peeples, Matt (Arizona State University) [200] Social Boundaries and Ceramic Technology across the Cibola Region: AD 1150-1325 The Cibola region of Arizona and New Mexico spans the gap between two traditionally defined archaeological cultures; Ancestral Pueblo and Mogollon. One distinction used to attribute sites to either of these archaeological constructs is the presence of either grayware or brownware ceramics typically interpreted as Ancestral Pueblo and Mogollon respectively. Recent research in the region has demonstrated that the distinction is not always so clear cut. In this poster, I use methods developed by quantitative morphologists for defining clusters among closely related biological species to explore variation in the technology of ceramic production across the Cibola region from AD 1150 to 1325.

Examinations of artifacts, documents, and archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological remains from 17th- through 19th-century Hispano sites provide an understanding of Hispano foodways and the basis of interactions among the communities in this ethnically diverse region. The 17th-century Hispano cuisine maintained Spanish practices, foods and preparation methods from Mexico, and the incorporation of Puebloan practices. Nineteenth-century Hispano foodways remained much the same. Knowledge of Native peoples` cuisines and relationships with their communities were necessities that provided security in an often harsh environment.

Previous analysis has shown this technique to be effective in identifying distinct paint recipes, but further refinement of the application is necessary.

While settlement patterns are key indicators of such integration, the relationship between chiefly centers and hinterland sites has never been empirically demonstrated in eastern Cuba. Using survey and site file data, this study models polity boundaries and regional integration through a GIS-based costdistance analysis and proposes a revised site hierarchy. The end result is a more informed rendering of prehistoric settlement and interaction, specifically as reflections of the operation of political economy.

Both the core zone and the periphery were organized into several small politically-independent chiefly districts within which ceremonial activities were important integrative forces. District populations were similar in both areas and thus the core zone`s greater monumentality is not attributable to greater demographic scale.

Important monumental and domestic feature alignments at all of these sites seem to violate Cahokia's cardinal, or solar, grid system. However, we argue from multiple lines of evidence that Cahokia's plan, as laid out in AD 1050, extended beyond the city

into the hinterlands and involved lunar and stellar alignments. In practice, such alignments belie promulgations of specific ancestral narratives that probably also played out as pilgrimages between Cahokia, a series of upland lunar shrines, and far-off Angel.

Building on these studies, as well as ethnohistoric literature from the region, several processing activities were evaluated for usewear patterns and residue buildup.

Pinson, Ariane (University of New Mexico & Central New Mexico CC) [118] Diet Breadth, Risk, and the Early Holocene Landscape Early Holocene environments in the West transformed rapidly in response to post-glacial changes in climate and hydrology. These changes were spatially and temporally variable, affecting the abundance and permanence of surface water and associated habitats. For some human foragers, this spatio-temporal variation in landscape change may have increased foraging risk and uncertainty that, in turn, would have impacted both diet breadth and patch choice. This paper explores the role of risk and uncertainty in shaping regional subsistence strategies among early Holocene foragers in the Western U.S. [41] see Jarman, Nicholas L.

Pitblado, Bonnie (Utah State University) [118] Seeds of Change or More of the Same? The Early Holocene of Southeastern Idaho Of all regions of the American West, southeastern Idaho has among the least-known Pleistocene and Early Holocene archaeological records. Yet of all western regions, it is ecologically unique as a land of fluvial, faunal and floral plenty amidst the true desert west, and we should not necessarily expect to see evidence for the seeds of change of this symposium`s title. Because the archaeological record is depauperate, this paper explores the paleoecological record of southeastern Idaho and offers predictions and what few conclusions are possible about the expression of Early Holocene human adaptations in the region.

Pitluga, Phyllis [89] Andean Milky Way Model Tested on Nasca Zones 6-7-8 Published conclusions so far on the huge Peruvian ground drawings include Zones 1-5 as a homogenous group of thirty identifiable contour-line figures etched into the landscape. By contrast, the figures at Zones 6 and 8 are created from heaps of stones shaped as two llamas (Zone 6) and an octopus (Zone 8). Zone 7 has contourline figures but they are not readily identifiable because of car tracks upon them. The hypothesis now tested is that data from Zones 1-5 can predict the celestial associations for Zones 6, 7 and 8 and the identities of the damaged Zone 7 figures.

Pitter, Sharmini (Stanford University) and Richard Evershed (University of Bristol) [48] Fatty Acid Residue Analysis of Pottery of Çatalhöyük, Turkey: Understanding the Relationships Between Animal Domestication, Ceramic Technology, Environmental Variation and Changes in Subsistence Practices A recent study performed by Evershed et al. (2008) seems to indicate that milking may have taken place in the Near East as early as the seventh millennium BC, a date that pre-dates previous estimates of the secondary products revolution (Sherrat, 1983) by several millennia. By following the methodology utilized in the study performed by Evershed et al. (2008) we hope to contribute a greater understanding of the beginnings of the use of milk products at Çatalhöyük and the cultural and/or technological factors, including the development of pottery on site, that lead to the development of secondary product utilization. Plager, Sharon [43] see Sayer, Camille Plimpton, Christine [92] Determining Domestic Space Use Continuity Through Syntactic Analysis Culture influences the built environment and determines how people utilize the space. If a culture is subjugated by another, would the dominating culture influence the cognition of domestic space use? Egyptian culture is ideal for investigating this question because of its long cultural history consisting of periods of political stability, disintegration, and subjugation by other cultures. This paper presents syntactic analysis performed on house layouts from the Old Kingdom through the twentieth century. Initial analysis suggests that overall spatial configuration of Egyptian dwellings remained consistent, regardless of political dominance.

In Tiwanaku`s former heartland, the Titicaca Basin, this period was one of violent competition, environmental hardship, and increasing pastoralism. The landscape was claimed politically in new ways through prominent tombs and shifts in settlement to fortified outposts with strategic viewsheds.

My presentation investigates how mortuary practices articulate with socioeconomic and political institutions in emerging complex societies. I examine how ritual and symbolic aspects of mortuary practice were incorporated in the power-building strategies of prestige goods exchange and staple finance. By employing a contextual, regional and diachronic investigation of burial remains, this study focuses on social changes triggered by political and economic transformations in a broader, regional context.

This paper explores the possibility that these plazas do not represent temporally distinct villages, but instead, a single very large village.

In the Early Classic this control was seized by the Solano (Quichean) population. Recent excavations at El Soch indicate that trade routes during the Postclassic led from the northern Quiche area of Nebaj, El Soch and Alta Verapaz northward to the Peten and Mexico and that these were politically separate from those managed by the Quicheans in the Central Highlands of Guatemala. Popova, Laura (Arizona State University) [11] Political Ecology and Pastoral Pasts Poverty and famine have often impacted mobile or semi-mobile pastoral groups, especially in Africa, more that other people in society. As development agencies have struggled to understand why these particular groups are so vulnerable, they have looked to political ecology for answers. With its focus on ecological, economic, social and political issues, studies that took this particular theoretical stance often lead to more effective development strategies. In this paper, I will look at the way in which the discoveries development agencies have made about pastoralists in the last 5 years can be used to better illuminate pastoral pasts. Popper, Virginia (UMass Boston & MIT) [154] Comparing Colonial and Mission Neophyte Subsistence Systems in California Analyses of plant remains from several Mission period sites in California provide information on the dietary choices made by the colonial settlers and on changes in the subsistence practices of Native populations.

Porcasi, Judith (Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at UCLA) [31] Trans-Holocene Exploitation of Cervidae and Leporidae on the California Coast Two families of prey animals--the cervidae and the leporidae-provided the majority of terrestrial mammal protein for prehistoric coastal Californians. However, exploitation of the highly-ranked cervidae differed markedly over time and distance, prompting ongoing debate as to underlying causes. Here, nine coastal archaeofaunas are combined into coarse-grained patterns of transHolocene cervid and comparative small mammal (i.e., leporid) exploitation and flesh yield. While providing new images for the deerhunting debate, these data reveal that the combined biomass of both these prey families declined linearly over time, marking a conspicuous reduction in nutritional contribution from these keystone resources.

While the picture of Middle Preclassic Maya life, including their material culture, has sharpened, there are aspects that remain uninvestigated. One artifact type, identified as greenstone triangulates, has been found at several Belize Valley sites and in a variety of contexts. Although very few of these multi-faceted, polished groundstone items have been recovered, little research has focused on their distribution and function in the archaeological record.

American) [114] Insult to Reverence: The Evolution of Prehistoric Intrusiveness within the Casma Valley of Peru When the powerful Sechin Polity dominated the Casma Valley during the Initial Period, the probable administrative center was the immense Sechin Alto main mound which measures 300 x 250 x 35 m tall. When the polity declined at 1400 B.C., a rival culture built an administrative structure on the mound to demonstrate its newlyachieved dominance. Subsequent Early Horizon inhabitants of the mound more deliberately destroyed friezes, leveled the mound top, and recycled construction materials to build a small village there. Later reoccupations through the Late Intermediate Period consisted of small structures and intrusive burials that reflect reverence for the mound's former importance.

A powerful bureaucracy was critical to the establishment and perpetuation of this polity over a 500-year span. A special modular architectural form with rounded corners, wall niches, and bar closures functioned as an emblem of authority This "square-room unit" occurs repeatedly in administrative contexts that monitored craft production, intersite movement, and food production. A recurrent element in the local iconography shows this power symbol, and stamp and cylinder seals from Sechin Polity sites may also reflect bureaucratic activities.

I relate these studies to the archaeological record of Woodland ceramics from Ohio and Pennsylvania. I assess these methods and speculate how prehistoric learning of ceramic production may have taken place based on experimental recreating of the manufacturing process, archaeological data from several sites, and historical learning behaviors.

Although many trees in tropical regions do not produce visible rings, the maximum isotope-values of cellulose were sensitive to rainfall amount in the dry season and correlated with maximum oxygen-isotope values of precipitation each year. Isotopic ring-widths were correlated with temperature, rainfall amount and annual variations in oxygenisotope values of cellulose.

[222] What Are We Saying and Who is Listening? Archaeology`s Public Audience and the Impact of Social Change Agency archaeologists spend at least some part of each day conveying the message of what they do and why they do it to a nonspecialist audience. Politics, regulatory changes, and theoretical changes in academic disciplines have significant effects on the message. It has long been acknowledged that telling about the past is affected by recent history, but there has not been much explicit examination of how this occurs. This paper examines recent history and social change as they have affected communication about archaeology to a variety of audiences in New Mexico and beyond in the last thirty years.

Prufer, Keith (University of New Mexico) and Adam Nazaroff (Stanford University) [148] Applications of PXRF Spectrometry in Cave Research Innovations in Portable Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry have increased the applications of PXRF for archaeological and geological research into the chemical characterization of geologic materials. We report on potential uses of PXRF in cave research for mineralogical characterization of speleothems. PXRF is a nondestructive technique for in-situ analysis, potentially allowing for sampling multiple speleothem surfaces without damaging fragile cave contexts. Our infield study of strontium values of stalagmites was done to test PXRF for differentiating calcite and aragonite used in paleoclimate reconstruction. Discerning these minerals on surfaces of stalagmites allows for targeted sampling of speleothems, maximizing cave conservation.

During the Late Bronze Age (c. 1600­1070 BC) Mycenae expanded its power, when it came into conflict with Kolonna in the coastal regions.

Deep, intact archaeological features and deposits dating to as early as ca. 8,000 cal yr BP were discovered during archaeological excavations and construction monitoring. The archaeological and stratigraphic records found at the sites suggest that sediment accumulation in some upland areas of the region did not cease after the deposition of late Pleistocene catastrophic flood sediments, but continued well into the Holocene in the form of eolian deposition.

Quesenberry, Melisa [99] The Virgin of the Cenote: Yucatán's Goddess in the Well Since the early Colonial period the Christian Virgin has been an important part of religious culture in Mexico`s Yucatán.

This paper surveys colonial structures dedicated to the Virgin which are uniquely situated adjacent to cenotes. Conceived as portals to the underworld, the dwelling place of the rain gods and the moon goddess, the cenote also became a locus of power for the Christian Virgin as well. Ethnohistoric sources and modern folklore reveal that the association of the Virgin with the cenote is both pervasive and persistent. Quinlan, Angus (Nevada Rock Art Foundation) [211] Southern Nevada Rock Art as Symbolic Culture Rock art is perhaps the most visible record of the social and economic lives of southern Nevada's prehistoric and ethnohistoric peoples. Rock art's enduring cultural resonance is a property of the social memories expressed and reproduced through its visual imagery and associated actions performed at rock art locales. This paper explores a social archaeology of identity through southern Nevada rock art and the role that its rock art can play in the study of the ideological presentation of past social and cultural identities.

Galway, Ireland Features observed during pedestrian survey are not always what they seem, and this is problematic for archaeologists on the west coast of Ireland where systematic subsurface survey and testing has been significantly underutilized and existing chronological and typological classifications are often held as fact, not as testable hypotheses. Using a combination of aerial photography, surface survey, GPS mapping, subsurface geophysical survey, and test excavations, this project has explored an exposed residential landscape with a multiplicity of approaches and a level of resolution that is often not utilized in an Irish context. Based on the case study of Inis Airc, Co. Galway, it is possible to evaluate archaeological techniques and challenge existing assumptions about landscape use on the west coast of Ireland.

Stable isotopic (d13C, d15N) analysis has been used extensively to infer aspects of past human diet from skeletal material in archaeological contexts. Few studies have applied the methods to questions of cannibalism, and of those, all have focused on potentially cannibalized individuals. Clearly, very few modern analogs

Pye, Jeremy (University of Florida) [232] Faithful To Their Trust, Even Unto Death: Expressions of Identity and Change in an Oklahoma Cemetery Landscape In March of 2007, a documentation survey was conducted at Diamond Cemetery, Stephens County, Oklahoma. One hundred and fifty-seven grave markers and monuments were recorded during this survey, ranging from formal stone monuments to homemade markers. Individual grave markers often reflect temporal stylistic variation. Furthermore, size differences may directly relate to supposed economic wealth. Beyond these traditional concerns, however, analysis of gravestone symbolism and epitaphs shed light on belief systems, backgrounds and social identities of individuals and families through time. More importantly, analyses of this type allow for inquiry into the cultural structure of the community as a whole.

However, by reconstructing diet categories from known food resources in a specific environment, a cannibalistic isotopic signature may be constrained. In this study, we model a cannibalistic diet category for Holocene Pacific Islanders and identify specific conditions of isotopic equifinality.

This research applies sclerochronological techniques to document the annual periodicity of shell formation in modern populations of hard clams from St. Catherines Island and applies this model to Archaic period zooarchaeological assemblages. The data show that hard clams were intensively harvested during the late winter and spring seasons at the St. Catherines Island Shell Ring and the McQueens Shell Ring.

Raab, Annabel (University of Denver) [99] Evidence of a pan-Mesoamerican Oracle/Priestess Complex This paper offers evidence of a gender-specific, pan- Mesoamerican oracle/priestess complex among mature, elite women using Classic/Postclassic period evidence. Archaeological and textual data reveals that these women were elaborately interred with grave goods marking them as weavers, as well as connecting them with both bloodletting and cosmological events. The evidence used varies both temporally and geographically; however the methodology used will both uncover and link the patterns of this pan-Mesoamerican complex. Glyphic and figural representations of Lady K'ab'al Xook from the Maya site of Yaxchilán will serve as a basis for the argument.

Settlement Continuity or Replacement? Archaeological survey of ca. 20,000 acres in central Mississippi has recorded about 55 sites with Protohistoric components, marked by aboriginal ceramics tempered with shell, mixed shell-and-grog and grog. Some have combed or incised decorations associated with Choctaw populations. About 50 early-to-mid nineteenth century components also have been found, identified by mostly English-made transfer-printed and edge-decorated pearlware (four assemblages) and whiteware. Only five sites show evidence of both Protohistoric and early Historic occupation. Hypotheses postulating rapid technological change among the Choctaws or replacement of their settlements by those of incomers are tested.

Since 2003 the College of Southern Nevada has conducted four intensive block surveys in the area. Cultural resources recorded by the surveys include lithic scatters, rockshelters and overhangs, campsites with associated petroglyph panels, and historic remains including one of the earliest historic roads in southern Nevada.

Rafferty, Sean (University At Albany, SUNY) [55] Analysis of Tobacco Pipe Residues through GC/MS and Raman Microscopy This paper presents ongoing research into the identification of tobacco residues in ancient smoking pipes. Two techniques have been used so far: gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS), and Raman microscopy. GC/MS has been used successful in the past by the author to identify ancient tobacco residues, and the results of this round of analysis support prior research. Raman microscopy, which has the advantage of working on dry samples without solvents, was not successful. It appears that combustion products overwhelm any useful signal that would identify the substance smoked. We are pursuing the use of Raman in noncombusted samples. Railey, Jim (SWCA - Albuquerque) and Matthew Bandy (SWCA Environmental Consultants) [87] Demography and Subsistence-Settlement Trends in the Permian Basin Study Area, Southeastern New Mexico Radiocarbon dates from the BLM's Permian Basin study area (southeastern New Mexico) show a dramatic spike beginning in very late pre-ceramic times, peaking in the Early Formative period, and then dropping off again in the Late Formative. The trend line is consistent with numbers and distributions of diagnostic artifacts. These data suggest settlement and subsistence patterns may be similar to those evidenced in the Fort Bliss area to the west, where extensive land use by mobile hunter-gatherers was followed by a shift to farming and more concentrated occupation in better-watered riverine areas and alluvial-fan margins of the desert floor.

This study evaluates the validity of this assumption, exploring the use of multiple relative chronologies to establish temporal patterns of discard across different artifact classes. Over 500 pieces of obsidian from surface middens at San Marcos Pueblo were sourced by Jeff Ferguson of the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) and hydration values calculated for 320. The resulting relative OHD chronology of midden use is compared to that of glaze-paint ceramics.

The Lagomorph Index has been used to examine changes in Lagomorph species in xeric environments such as the Southwestern United States. A change in the proportionate representation of these species may serve as a barometer for environmental change due to human impacts which can result in resource depression.

Polynesian DNA on chicken bones from southern Chile has become the first hard evidence for a real contact, but the old hypothesis has new and better support. Some human osteological data suggest the contact was more than a brief encounter, the only way to explain some oral history, linguistics and material culture, since adoption and adaptation by a local population requires a long term relationship. An assessment of the old and new data involves a reconsideration of the diffusion process and contact situations, which supports a new hypothesis for the transportation of Southamerican products back to Polynesia.

We examine how the Younger Dryas fits into these larger-scale environmental changes, including its differential impact on marine and terrestrial ecosystems and the adaptations of people foraging or living in those environments. We also explore some innovative approaches to finding early coastal archaeological sites, and consider the impact of a fragmentary archaeological record on interpretations of Younger Dryas adaptations.

Total storage areas and volumetric capacities of storage containers indicate that centralization of agricultural resources at political centers was limited and that generally they were not financed solely on the basis of accumulation and distribution of staple goods. Textual and archaeological data indicate that besides supplying dependent and semi-dependent workers with payments, Mycenaean elites were largely concerned with conspicuous consumption and feasting involving certain kinds and quantities of agricultural commodities. Thus, agricultural commodities were utilized in a variety of manners dependent on varying social contexts.

Cahokia`s craftsmen created objects ritually animated to embodied specific aspects of the sacred while visualizing several episodes of creation narratives.

Estuarine fishes are a mixture of endemic, marine, and freshwater species attracted to estuaries as nursery grounds and feeding areas. The potential of estuaries to fill these roles varies seasonally, raising the possibility that fishes can serve as proxies for seasonal patterning in human fishing strategies. In this study, the spatial and seasonal habits of modern and archaeological fishes are evaluated for evidence of seasonal fishing strategies. We find that fishing was highly selective and that some fish taxa in the archaeological record are not markedly seasonal, limiting the value of simple fish identifications to provide seasonal fishing information.

The suite of resources available in the Basin likely differed from those encountered elsewhere on the Southern Plains.

In areas where there is minimal seasonal temperature variation, such as Mesoamerica, it would be expected that d18O variation observed in shell carbonate would be a reflection of seasonal variation in rainfall and evaporation, rather than seasonal temperature variation.

Results will be briefly reviewed, synthesized and interpreted to tease out meaning embedded in the contents of the burial chamber, thus providing a glimpse into the life history and treatment at death of this unknown royal personage.

Although red-andwhite pottery is well known from the lower Mississippi River valley, such pottery is rare at Cahokia or elsewhere in the region. Currently, the only examples of red-and-white Mississippian pottery in the upper Mississippi River Valley come from the southeast Wisconsin site of Aztalan. This paper provides a morphometric and compositional analysis of the Aztalan and Cahokian assemblages. Richards, John [70] see Jeske, Robert J.

Richerson, Peter (UC Davis), Charles Efferson (University of Zurich) and Robert Boyd (University of california--Los Angeles) [197] Using a Lotka-Volterra Approach to Modeling Socioeconomic Change The Lotka-Volterra equations are an extension of logistic population growth to multi-species dynamics. We consider a system in which humans subsist on a renewable resource using a particular technology. The technology evolves in a density dependent fashion. Large populations accumulate technology and small ones lose it. Simple mathematical realizations of this system exhibit a great variety of behavior. The technology-population size feedback contains the potential for both slow and explosive growth of human populations, their resource, and technology ("intensification"). If the human population can invest in their biotic resource ("agriculture"), slow or rapid growth can be sustained for a substantial period. On the other hand, when human populations are large, and investments in the resource are limited or impossible ("foraging"), boom and bust dynamics occur. We argue that the Lotka-Volterra approach to modeling human systems is a promising approach to human ecology and evolution. Richman, Rebecca [122] see Kuzminsky, Susan C. Richter, Daniel (Max Planck Institute) [157] The Chronostratigraphy of the Swabian early Upper Palaeolithic The Swabian early Upper Palaeolithic is represented by several well defined stratigraphies, which were shown to be intact by micromorphological analysis. However, radiocarbon dating fails to show a coherent pattern. The data indicates the presence of problems in radiocarbon dating beyond simple contamination, which is especially evident for samples from Middle Palaeolithic layers which are clearly separated from the Upper Palaeolithic by sterile clay

sediments. Other chronometric dating methods are therefore required for historical interpretation. As a consequence the chronostratigraphy of the Swabian Alb is still mainly based on the stratigraphical succession of sediments and industries. Rick, Torben (Smithsonian Institution) and Todd Braje (Humboldt State University) [16] What is Natural and What is Anthropogenic in the Historical Ecology of California`s Channel Islands? Archaeologists have long dealt with equifinality, when fragmentary archaeological data provide patterns that seemingly result from multiple processes. With the rise of historical ecology and investigations into ancient human environmental impacts, zooarchaeologists, paleobotanists, and other researchers are again confronting issues of equifinality when interpreting changes in faunal, floral, and other data in light of human subsistence activities, climate change, and other events. Here we provide archaeological examples from our recent work on California`s Channel Islands, demonstrating some challenges in interpreting long-term environmental and archaeological data, and strategies for delineating patterns which result from natural and/or anthropogenic processes.

These analyses are highly developed and include approaches that examine allometry and symmetry. The widespread availability of 3D scanning devices opens up the potential for three-dimensional analysis of these artifacts. This paper presents the results of a new method for analyzing and representing the three dimensional shape of handaxes and compares these results with the results generated by 2 dimensional analysis of shape. It is proposed that the strength of 3D analysis is that it provides insight into the distribution of mass that would have been relevant to the functioning of the tool and thus is a useful counterbalance to methods that emphasize the plan view.

Riggs, Casey (Texas A&M University) and Tim Riley [55] Resource Processing in the Chihuahuan Desert: A Microbotanical Analysis of Stone Tools from West Texas This paper presents initial results from a microbotanical study of stone tools recovered in excavations from both the Lower Pecos Canyonlands and the Trans-Pecos of Texas. The current study presents a starch grain analysis of groundstone implements recovered from a number of sites across the Eastern Trans-Pecos. There is a lack of understanding of the use of groundstone tools recovered from hunter-gatherer sites. This is complemented by a microscopic analysis of visible adhering residue present on flakestone tools recovered from the canyonlands of the Lower Pecos.

Ringle, William (Davidson College) [178] Form and Function of Las Monjas, Uxmal Although one of the iconic examples of Maya architecture, the function of the Monjas Complex of Uxmal continues to be debated. This paper argues for its role as the central court of Uxmal, following our earlier identification, but proposes specific functions for each of the structures. Supporting this are parallels with Chichen Itza and with colonial descriptions of palaces. The implications of this interpretation for our understanding of Uxmal`s political organization and its external relations with Chichen and the Puuc Hills are discussed. Rink, W.

Riordan, Robert (Wright State University) [176] Within Fort Ancient Until recently, very few internal features had been located at Ohio Hopewell enclosures that might help to elucidate the nature of the activities or gatherings that occurred within them. The application of remote sensing technologies has, however, begun to change this picture. At Fort Ancient, magnetometry detected a 60m diameter circular feature labeled the Moorehead Circle in 2005, which has been under excavation since 2006. This paper discusses the features revealed to date, including wooden posts set around the perimeter, a central pit containing burned soil, and bands of embedded stones, and offers interpretive suggestions concerning their import.

Even though northern Spain has a long history of Paleolithic investigation, only recently has the direct identification and characterization of utilized chert quarries become integrated into the research. Data collected from chert quarries in north-central Spain will be presented using a geographic information system through which synchronic and diachronic observations are discussed. The continued survey, characterization and dissemination of quarry data from this region will produce an increased understanding of these Paleolithic cultures.

This approach will show how these regions, with different historical trajectories of development, interacted with Tiwanaku and formed part of its sphere of influence in very singular and varied ways, although sharing some elements basic to Tiwanaku religious ideology. This comparative approach is a result of my field research in all three regions of the South-Central Andes. Rivera, Mario (Beloit College), Daniel E.

Our goal is that by applying tree-ring analysis, we would learn more about the timing and seasonal patterns that characterized the region at the time of settlement. Using samples of Prosopis tamarugo Phil. (tamarugo), and Prosopis alba Griseb (algarrobo) we were able to develop three floating chronologies that will help us One for the Ramaditas archaeological site (already radiocarbon dated to 600 B.C.), and two additional ones based on the samples coming from living trees, and taken from elsewhere in the Atacama Desert. Overall, they correspond with similar dendrochronological studies from NW Argentina and the Bolivian Altiplano. [94] Discussant Rivera Estrada, Araceli (M.C.G.)

Rivers, Ray (Imperial College London), Carl Knappett (University of Toronto), and Tim Evans (Imperial College London) [113] Resilience and (In)stability in Social Networks: The Eruption of Thera and the Burning of the Palaces. In constructing social networks we need to distinguish between resilience and stability. A network is resilient if it is able to survive a shock to the system that damages it, in one way or another. A network is stable if, on changing it slightly, it will tend to revert to its original state. Equally, a network is unstable if a small change nudges it past its tipping point. We shall argue that the maritime network of the MBA S.Aegean is both resilient, in that it survives the loss of Thera and the immediate consequences of the eruption that destroyed Thera, and unstable, in that an aggregation of small changes following the eruption plausibly lead to a collapse of the system. Further, this collapse occurs because the development of strong ties weakens the system (the complement to Granovetter's strength of weak ties). [113] First Chair Rizvi, Uzma (Pratt Institute) [181] Archaeology of Time and Title: Labeling "Primitive" and "Tribal" and its effects in Contemporary Indigenous Communities in India Through the establishment of disciplines such as archaeology, a significant part of the colonial agenda included the control of time and categorization of human populations. Categories of time became synonymous with technological traits, which in turn defined human characteristics. The use of 'primitive`'to define populations, and chronological markers such as 'Stone Age,' create an indelible link between time, technology, and human subjectivity. This paper examines how time was used to categorize people in colonial India, how those categorizations continue to haunt archaeological practice, and will query the role of indigenous politics in contemporary archaeology in India.

The presence of a blacksmith was necessary for European expansion and sustainability within the frontier environment, but how did blacksmithing change with time as Europeans adapted to the frontier and the various demands from the diverse populations of the fur trade? Using x-ray fluorescence technology to examine metal artifacts from Fort Michilimackinac serves as a case study for understanding the nature of European adaptations while balancing political agendas and maintaining social relationships on which they were dependent for survival.

A pithouse occupied circa AD 500 lacks evidence of maize, yet two miles away maize (and mesquite) was stored in hundreds of pits between 200 BC and AD 1500. Las Vegas farmers adopted some Virgin Branch puebloan traditions, such as gray ware pottery, but not others, like slab-lined storage rooms. Did Las Vegas farmers remain highly mobile, farming only when foraging alternatives were poor? This paper examines Las Vegas` archaeological and ethnographic subsistence record using Renee Barlow`s 2006 formal model for predicting agriculture among the Great Basin Fremont.

Recent work indicates that the Late Classic Guatemalan Highlands had interregional cultural variation and territoriality expressed by defensive features. This paper will examine the settlement data from the Classic period in the Central highlands. It will consider the elite religious and political influence on residential and sacred sites, and consider the climatic evidence for the decline in populations at the end of the period. The paper will highlight the regionalization of highland cultures and contribute to the ongoing discussion of the Late Classic Maya. Robinson, Francis (University at Albany (SUNY)) [60] Early Woodland Mortuary Ceremonialism and Interaction Spheres: A View from three Middlesex Mortuary sites in Vermont Ongoing analyses of the environmental contexts, artifact assemblages, and extant documentation from three Middlesex sites in Vermont have provided evidence of significant variability despite the common presence of a small number of "diagnostic traits". While the interpretations of this variability are preliminary, the evidence thus far suggests that each site, in part, represents participation in overlapping, but semi-discrete inter-regional exchange networks. The geographic extent of these networks and the implications of the materials exchanged for aggrandizement and social differentiation within and between the groups studied are briefly explored.

Using a regional physiographic appraisal to identify raw material deposits and ethnographic data to estimate the human labor/effort invested, the chaîne opératoire and the specific tasks involved are reconstructed in order to quantify the energy input of the building process, thus contributing to our understanding of the local socioeconomic system for this poorly-known period of Cholula`s history. Rocek, Thomas (University of Delaware) [87] Jornada Huts and Houses: Implications of Formative Architectural Diversity in the Jornada Mogollon While researchers recognize substantial Formative architectural

variation within the Jornada Mogollon of southeastern New Mexico and extreme western Texas, much of the literature has focused on the Tularosa Basin and adjoining low-lying areas and has emphasized a single linear scale from small, shallow, ephemeral to large, deep, substantial pit structures to surface pueblos. In this paper I consider architectural diversity over a broader range of Jornada environmental contexts to examine economic, social, temporal, and possible ethnic differences underlying this diversity. I suggest that rather than a single continuum, architectural data imply multiple patterns of variation along these multiple cultural dimensions.

In this paper, I follow Hirth's lead by examining the varied contexts of jade wealth goods and the implications these patterns have for their function within Classic Maya society. Using data from the Middle Motagua Valley, Guatemala and elsewhere, I argue that current models of Classic Maya wealth goods production and use remain incomplete by failing to recognize the diverse ways in which particular artifact forms were employed.

[47] First Chair Rodell, Roland (University of Wisconsin Rock County) [105] Oneota Ceramics: Jar Size and Settlement Patterns in the Northern Mississippi Valley Oneota culture in the northern Mississippi Valley is identified with settlements concentrated in two localities: Red Wing­Pepin (AD 1000­1300) and La Crosse­Trempealeau (AD 1250­1600). Manifest in the temporal separation of these localities are variations in ceramic motifs and a significant expansion in house size. Ceramic data from nine sites reveal that another sequential disparity between the localities is an increase in the size of jars along with a reduction in stylistic variability. It is inferred that the ceramic data correlate with the social restructuring of Oneota communities within the northern valley.

But focusing only on the nutritional aspects of cooking ignores much broader social and cultural processes that surround food preparation. In this paper, we argue that cooking should be taken seriously as an aspect of social, cultural, political, and economic life, and we examine the relevance of cooking for different models about the past focusing especially on archaeological studies that have derived unique insights from the study of food preparation beyond subsistence. Rodriguez, Juan [196] Providing Access to "La Cultura" to Marginalized Communities in the Dominican Republic In developing countries the economic and cultural policies are traditionally concentrated in metropolitan areas. The Dominican Republic is not an exception. Due to the fact that most institutions are currently concentrated in the Capital city of Santo Domingo, more than 90% of the population has no access to "La Cultura:" museums, public libraries, art schools, theaters, and cultural events. By working together with the people of small villages to establish community museums and a "mobile museum" under development, these efforts serve to empower the people of rural localities, reinforce individual and community identities, and bolster economic development of the area. Rodriguez Ramos, Reniel (Universidad de Puerto Rico-Utuado) [116] On the Ideological Origins of Tainoness The superstructural foundations of the late (post-AD 1000) indigenous societies of the Greater Antilles have traditionally been conceived as being erected upon an amazonian template. It has been argued that these ideological principles were brought by the Arawak immigrants that ventured into the islands from northeastern South America, being reinterpreted and elaborated within the Antilles by the indigenous groups that eventually developed the cultural manifestations that have been erroneously homogenized with the homonym of Taínos. However, recent evidence that demonstrates the marked influence of the pre-Arawak societies of the islands in the developments that took place in late contexts in combination with the pan-regional interactions established between Antillean indigenous peoples with

those from other surrounding Circum-Caribbean regions, demand that we drastically revise our notions about the ways in which ideologies were articulated, negotiated, and consumed in the insular Caribbean.

The topographic settings range from a loess ridge top, to an alluvial terrace, to a glacial wetland. Two of the ridged fields are near burial mound groups. Two ridged fields exhibit high phosphorus, suggesting the use of ash as fertilizer. The wetland ridged field did not have high phosphorus, possibly because the soil was already highly fertile. The probable reason for constructing ridges is to reduce the moisture level which can increase the length of the growing season, and in some cases allow the use of hydric soils.

Roos, Christopher (University of South Florida) [228] Fire and the Making of Western Apache Landscapes in the Mountains of Eastern Arizona Keith Basso`s Wisdom Sits in Places articulates the im portance of natural landscapes in the transmission of Western Apache culture. I suggest that this relationship is also recursive; evidence from oral tradition, ethnography, dendrochronology, and geoarchaeology suggest that Western Apaches actively shaped their landscapes through the use of fire, simultaneously creating Western Apache cultural environments and the natural landscapes appropriate for teaching Apache lifeways. This was particularly true for upland environments dominated by ponderosa pine forests. There is tantalizing evidence that this practice of Western Apache pyrogenic placemaking in upland pine forests may have great antiquity and predate Athapaskan migrations to the Southwest U.S. [198] see Hollenback, Kacy L.

Central Plains tradition pottery has been studied for over a century, but it is fair to say that it has been vastly understudied. A current research program seeks to move away from traditional typological and chronological concerns and moves toward an understanding of past behavior materialized in the pottery. To this end, vessel form, ceramic composition and production technology, style variation, and the geographic variation within these domains is being studied. The research is showing how the geographic variety of the Plains affects ceramic technology and empirically documenting the social landscape of the region in the early second millennium.

Rorabaugh, Adam (Washington State University) [203] Investigating the Cultural Transmission and Variation of Barbed Bone and Antler Technologies in the Gulf of Georgia, Northwest North America While anthropologists have long discussed the evolution of social complexity on the Northwest Coast, the relationship between material culture and complexity is a less-explored topic. Viewed from the perspective of Boyd and Richerson's dual inheritance theory, the development of social stratification and systems of deference may influence the contexts of social learning. Prestige-based indirect bias was predicted as a factor in the learning of technologies tied to systems of resource procurement and prestige-based status as complexity developed. Barbed bone and antler points are examined as a technology tied to these resource systems and prestige-based status. Point functional and culture-historic hypotheses are also assessed. Rosania, Corinne (University of Missouri, Columbia) [123] Paleozoology and North American Black Bear (Ursus americanus) Ecology Born from the fusion of archaeology and zoology during the 20th century, zooarchaeology (paleozoology) draws on the resources of myriad fields (i.e., archaeology, paleontology, chemistry, geology, zoology and conservation biology) to investigate past cultures and past environments. Likewise, temporally deep ecological knowledge culled by paleozoologists is increasingly applied to modern wildlife management and conservation ecology. Herein, stable isotope analysis reveals late Holocene North American black bear (Ursus americanus) diet in Missouri. Documentation of native ursid diet which is not historically known should influence modern conservation efforts that seek to restore this once-extirpated species to the region. Roscoe, Paul (University of Maine) [206] The Conditions for Cannibalism Cannibalism is a topic avoided in social anthropology and a matter of controversy in archaeology. On the premise that cannibalism is a human trait but its appearance a product of circumstance, this paper investigates the distribution of exocannibalism in 120 New Guinea societies, and finds that it is almost exclusively limited to low-density communities. Only in low density societies, the paper proposes, is butchery of a corpse following an assault militarily practical, a circumstance that fuels a spiral of revenge-cannibalism.

In the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness, most homesteads were small farms built by their owners employing simple tools and methods. Today, the construction techniques and materials found in these historic features reflect the economic decisions made by historic households.

[70] Power from the Earth: Effigy Mound Social Landscapes Recent spatial studies of ceramic and mound style have shed new light on Late Woodland social landscapes in Wisconsin. Data concerning ceramic style is consistent with previous models of effigybuilding populations as mobile and socially-fluid. Data concerning mound style, on the other hand, hints at territoriality and the existence of multiple internal social divisions. This contradiction may be resolved by postulating the existence of territorially-bound ritual specialists, standing at the heart of each Effigy Mound community and competing for the allegiance of other community members. Rosenberg, Danny [147] see Nadel, Dani Rosenstein, Dana (University of Arizona) and James Feathers (University of Washington) [182] Luminescence Dating of Samples from Recent Contexts in South Africa The last 500 years was a formative period of the southern African past, during which hunter-gatherers, agropastoralists and colonists interacted frequently and intensely on the shared landscape. A finegrained historical understanding of this period requires the chronological sequence of archaeological site settlement and abandonment to be highly resolved. Because of acute De Vries effects, radiocarbon dating is inadequate over the last 500 years. Using luminescence dating, chronometric results with high precision have been obtained for South African sites. These results contribute to current research developing methodologies for measuring luminescence and calculating ages of samples from recent contexts (Pietsch 2009).

During the course of this millennium, a small community developed into a local political center and monumental architecture was built for the first time. Macrobotanical and vertebrate faunal evidence allow us to reconstruct changing diet of the site`s residents and ceramic remains inform us about food preparation and presentation. These patterns are employed to explore the relationship between changing economic and political patterns at the site.

In particular, this paper utilizes the latest results of macrobotanical analysis from samples of the "Bronze Palace" on the high mound of Ziyaret Tepe to explore the politics of agricultural practices in southeastern Turkey during the Late Assyrian imperial period (ca. 900-600 BCE). Analysis of the Bronze Palace paleobotanical assemblage will focus on indications of resource disparities, in order to discern whether agrarian practices have the potential to create and/or maintain social differentiation and political inequality.

Resistance to NAGPRA-based repatriation in New York state has taken several forms, including obfuscation of archaeological data and misinformation campaigns designed to discredit archaeological research. The implications for research conducted over the last three summers at the Levanna site are discussed. This issue lies at the core of reasons for performing and transforming archaeology in the 21st century. [66] Discussant Rostoker, Arthur (Proyecto Ipiamais [23] A pedestrian approach to Tropical Forest Archaeology: in advance of magic bullets. For archaeologists trained in the past 50 years, collaboration with technicians and scientists from related disciplines is routine. Recently, archaeometric equipment, particularly for remote sensing, has become portable and user friendly. Students are routinely trained to use it, yet remote sensing is not a magic bullet for all seasons. In the mud and broken terrain of the eastern slope of the Andes, with buried anomalies few and far between, reconnaissance and survey are best carried out on foot, probing with hand tools. An ancillary benefit of this simple methodology is that most available funds are expended within rural host communities. Roth, Barbara (UNLV) [248] Were They Sedentary and Does it Matter? Early Farmers in the Tucson Basin Much of the recent literature on the Late Archaic/Early Agricultural period in the Tucson Basin has focused on establishing whether these groups were sedentary irrigation agriculturalists or practiced some level of mobility, at least during part of the year. I argue here that the question "were they sedentary?" limits our understanding of these early farmers. It appears that they were flexible in their responses to both environmental and social conditions, sometimes aggregating into larger, more stable communities and other times moving seasonally. I discuss the implications of this for our interpretations of early farmers throughout the Sonoran Desert region.

Recent studies tend to rely on spatial differences in elemental concentrations for identifying activity patterns in the archaeological record. However, other related soil properties, including pH and organic matter, sometimes correlate with chemical residues, especially phosphates. The research presented explores these interconnections with the greater goal of identifying the ways and extent to which various soil properties are linked in the formation and preservation of ancient activity loci. Rothman, Mitchell (Widener University) [96] Discussant Roth-Murray, Carrie (University of Wales, Lampeter) [82] Artefacts and Ecofacts: Questioning the Social Role of Material Culture In Classical Archaeology, material culture is seen as being emblematic of complex societies. As a result, material culture is often viewed in economic terms, identifying groups of producers, traders, and consumers, as well as in artistic terms, identifying which groups are the better producers. The discovery of unworked ecofacts, particularly seashells, in burials and votive deposits indicates that other symbolic elements are at work in the exchange and function of

materials. Social and symbolic dimensions concerning the use of ecofacts and artefacts in Mediterranean contexts must be considered. Cross-cultural comparanda from North America will be considered to inform this discussion. Rothschild, Nan (Barnard, Columbia univers) and Heather Atherton (Columbia University) [181] Material Manifestations (or Not) of Ethnic Identity Initially concerned with addressing constructions of ethnicity and identity, research at the late 18th-century Spanish Colonial village of San José de las Huertas, NM revealed that a complex relationship existed between multiple ascribed and elective identities, many of which are not visible in the material record. Using Las Huertas as the principal case study, this paper examines the disjuncture between material objects and casta or ethnic identifications described in oral and historical accounts of Spanish Colonial America. It also seeks to explore the legacy, if any, this disjuncture has had on the present-day descendant community. Rouse, Lynne (Wash U in St. Louis) [222] Risking It All: The Long-Term Effect of Economic and Political Strategies in the Oasis Communities of Bronze Age Turkmenistan An essential component of our understanding of diachronic change in any ancient society is to ascertain the factors that drove decisionmaking processes. Both on the individual and the community level, decisions based on risk-minimization rather than productionmaximization affected the trajectory of economic and political strategies. This paper focuses on the Bronze Age of southern Turkmenistan (ca. 2200 ­ 1500 B.C.). Specifically, I examine the available archaeological data for the developed agricultural societies of the Murghab delta, focusing on their relationship with independent mobile pastoral groups. I asses this data for indications of either riskminimization or production-maximization approaches to decisionmaking and examine their long-term effects.

The logicist model consists of defining the set of basic data (archaeological and other) and the sequence of inferences made to support a hypothesis, followed by use of this data. It enables us to progressively constitute a logicist corpus that is a thematic knowledge base on grinding material.

Ruby, Allika (Far Western Anthropological Research Group) and William Hildebrandt (Far Western Anthropological Research Group, Inc.) [154] Dietary Persistence and Tool Selection in a Changing Economy: Obsolete or Optimal? Native peoples of southeastern California were among the last in North America to have continuous direct contact with Euroamericans. In the forests of Coso Mountains, just east of the Sierra Nevada, pinyon nuts continued to be harvested well into the modern era and traditional processing tools were used even after other kinds of tools were replaced by mass-produced forms. A key assumption of acculturation is that traditional materials will be substituted for Euroamerican imports when available; our findings indicate that this process is more complex and requires a refined understanding of the costs and benefits associated with technological substitutions. Rudolph, Katie (UW- Milwaukee), Douglas K. Charles (Wesleyan University) and Jane E. Buikstra (Arizona State University) [215] Structure and Renewal at the Mound House Site in Greene County, Illinois Ceremonialism and ritual renewal has been coupled with Middle Woodland mound construction and use in the Lower Illinois River Valley. Investigation of a basal postmold structure in Mound 1 at the Mound House site, Greene County, Illinois, supports this interpretation. Spatial organization of nearly 500 postmolds on the pre-mound surface including evidence of three parallel, concentric arcs suggests repeated activity at Mound 1 prior to, and in conjunction with, mound construction. This reinforces an argument for cyclic, ritual use of the Mound House site and offers an additional perspective on Middle Woodland mounds in the Lower Illinois Valley. Rugroden, Sara [235] Liminality and Architecture: The Search for the Space Inbetween In 2009, I examined ritual architecture at the site of Paquimé (AD 1250-1450), northern Mexico, with the intention of identifying liminal spaces. According to Arnold van Gennep`s model, liminal spaces should bridge or connect sacred with profane locations. Specifically, I compared architectural spaces that were adjacent to previously identified ritual spaces with theorized characteristics of liminal spaces. My research concluded that most of the defined ritual spaces at Paquimé have at least one contiguous liminal space. In this poster I assess if this model is more broadly applicable by attempting to identify liminal spaces in other archaeological sites.

The work suggests that the city was far larger and more complex than previously understood and provides a more complete picture of the city`s form and layout. This paper will explore the implications of this data for our understanding of the social transformations taking place between the Classic and Postclassic periods of Maya history. [20] Third Organizer Russell, Nerissa (Cornell University) [82] The Three Faces of Domestication Animal domestication is difficult to define. Scholars have variously emphasized physical or behavioral changes, human control mechanisms, and property relations. Biologists tend to stress the biological aspects, while archaeologists and anthropologists more often focus on the social. Here I classify domestication models: according to type species of the domestic animal. Dogs, sheep, and cattle have inspired the most modeling. Most scholars have generalized from their favorite species to all domesticates, but it is more useful to recognize at least three distinct routes to domestication. While there are some similarities among these paths, many features are distinctive, especially the motivations. [82] First Chair Russell, Will (Arizona State University) [192] El Paso Polychrome and Site Chronology in the Postclassic Eastern Mimbres Region Late Postclassic (AD 1250-1450) pueblos in the eastern Mimbres area are highly variable with regard to architecture, settlement layout, and inter-regional connectivity. Traditional ceramic seriation, with admittedly coarse resolution, suggests that these villages were contemporaneous. If true, their differences may indicate disparate, though proximate, social identities. El Paso Polychrome (ca. AD 1000-1450) is present at most late sites in the area. This type exhibits temporally diagnostic morphology allowing the ordering of jar rim sherds. Analyses based on these attributes have addressed the contemporaneity of three Late ostclassic, eastern Mimbres sites, contributing to an improved understanding of social ariability and reorganization.

Ryan, Karen (Canadian Museum of Civilization) and Janet Young (Canadian Museum of Civilization) [79] A Possible Example of Shamanistic Healing Amongst the Sadlermiut Inuit of Arctic Canada The existence of shamans (angakkuit) and a shamanistic belief system are widely reported in historic Inuit society. Angakkuit acted primarily as mediators between the spiritual and physical worlds and were often tasked with performing healing rituals. While certain details of these events are well reported, others (particularly the use of shamanistic paraphernalia) are conspicuously absent. The present study discusses a human figurine found in a Sadlermiut grave which was modified to mirror illnesses evident on the grave occupant`s skeleton. We examine how this unique burial provides an opportunity to explore concepts of illness, healing, and spirituality in Inuit society. Ryan, Susan (University of Arizona and Crow Canyon Arch.

Using Shields Pueblo as a case study, this paper examines ritual termination and renewal behavior as a means of creating a ritually-charged vertical space continuum. Shrines physically identified and commemorated structures imbued with ritual significance, perpetuating that significance despite the structures decommissioned status. Additionally, the shrines evoked memories and cued subsequent generations into recalling the significance of place, a place that was depopulated shortly after the shrines were constructed.

Colonial metalworking is poorly documented and therefore assumed to involve primitive technologies and unspecialized labor. Recent archaeology in southern New England demonstrates that a thriving metals industry existed during the colonial period, one that involved multicultural laborers, tight networks of production, innovative techniques, and complex manipulations of natural resources in otherwise unfamiliar environments. The development of these technologies over several generations, and the cross-craft techniques involved in production are discussed using historical, archaeological, and metallurgical examples.

The survey of the upper level of Actun Yaxteel Ahau, conducted during the spring of 2009, documented four elaborate speleothem complexes that present a very similar structural layout. All appear to have been heavily utilized in much the same way. This paper presents the first analysis of speleothem complexes as sacred space. The ancient Maya are known to have employed architecture to create enclosed space. It appears, however, that they gravitated to these natural features because of the special importance of the drip-water formation matrix.

This neglects the majority of social life. The reconstruction of houses, house groups and house groups within a community in the site of El Cabo, eastern Dominican Republic, focuses on indigenous sociality, aesthetics and a domestic identity.

skeleton from Roc de Marsal (RdM) has been one of the less contentious examples. This is due in large part to claims that it was recovered from an intentionally excavated pit and was associated with "grave goods". However, based on the actual original evidence on the context of the remains and on new data from recent excavations, no compelling evidence exists to show intentional burial. The original published and unpublished evidence and data from the recent excavations will be presented here Sandgathe, Dennis [8] see Aldeias, Vera l.d.; [8] see Dibble, Harold L.; [8] see McPherron, Shannon P.; [8] see Turq, Alain; [8] First Chair [8] Second Organizer Sanger, Matthew (American Museum of Natural History) [217] Vacant Quarters and Rising Tides: Visible Shifts in the Relational Landscape along the Georgia Coast (USA) Combining data from coastal islands, hammocks, and near coast mainland this paper investigates the dynamic relationships between people, experienced environment, and conceptualized place over a span of 5,000 years. Environmental factors and socio-historical events, the most recognizable of which include sea-level changes during the Archaic and the establishment of a vacant quarter between competing chiefdoms during the Mississippian, produced archaeologically visible affects on settlement which relate to shifts in sociopolitical organization as well as inter and intra group relations. The changing relation between people and surrounding landscape is also theorized as various aspects of mobility suggest variable conceptions of space.

The resistance forces secretly planted wooden stakes set into the riverbed at low tide; the invading fleet was then lured into the trap and destroyed. The preliminary survey of 2009 identified hundreds of these wooden stakes which delineate the battlefield and the likely locations of hull remains. The newly discovered sites may possess a potentially rich archaeological record of historically undocumented Chinese/Mongolian ships, as well as clues for clarifying the naval battle tactics employed in the battle.

Historic records show the site as continuously occupied since the 1820s, eventually becoming a farmstead in the late 1830s. UW-Parkside and the Kenosha Public Museum have conducted archaeological field research from 2002 to the present. While much disturbance has occurred since the time of the post, remains encountered provide information on a variety of aspects of material culture of nineteenth century life in this locality. The authors provide an introduction to site history, contexts, and

archaeology. Saturno, William [64] see Sharpe, Ashley E.; [139] see Storozum, Michael Saul, Bruce M. [250] see Reitz, Elizabeth J. Saunders, Michael (Texas State University) [99] The Sacred Sites of San Jose Chacaya: Prehistoric Associations to Contemporary Ritual Indigenous religious beliefs still predominate in many Maya communities. Recent investigations in San José Chacayá, Guatemala, mapped the contemporary local sacred sites. While their distribution reflects patterning common in other Maya communities, the altar locations also reveal a relationship with an archaeological site around which they are clustered. As some of these altars are preConquest stone monuments and others appear to establish the boundaries of the archaeological zone, it seems that these altars also held significance for the prehistoric community. The continuity exhibited in their utilization today can help to identify the means by which contemporary sacred geography is defined. Saunders, Paula (City University of New York) [97] Up from the Ground: An Architectural Study of Enslaved Houses at a Nineteenth-Century Coffee Plantation in Jamaica This paper is an architectural study of houses in one enslaved African village community in nineteenth-century Jamaica. It examines the house form and features, materials used, and the innovations of African-descended peoples in developing solutions to their daily needs. Located near the Blue Mountain, Orange Vale was one of the largest coffee plantations in Jamaica during the peak of the coffee boom. By using naturally-occurring limestones and sandstones in constructing the foundation, steps, and thresholds of their dwellings, enslaved African peoples at this plantation demonstrate how the natural materials in their environment were transformed for both functional and cultural use.

It is only recently, however, that attempts to determine the effects of the enormous surpluses generated by the hunting of these animals may have had on Thule social structure. This paper examines these effects through the related themes of the logistical requirements for successful bowhead harvesting, and the transformation of the resulting whale product surpluses into wealth and status, at both the intra- and inter-village levels.

Sayer, Camille (Salmon-Challis National Forest) and Sharon Plager (Salmon-Challis National Forest) [43] Prehistoric Galleries Revealed in Idaho`s Rugged Camas Creek Drainage A formal inventory of the Camas Creek Trail was conducted on the Salmon-Challis National Forest. Camas Creek is a major tributary of the remote Middle Fork Salmon River in Idaho. Until the trail was punched through in the 1930`s, the lower canyon presented a virtually impassable travel route from the river to upland resources. The few historic sites documented are associated with either trail construction or its subsequent use. The remaining prehistoric sites were the focus of our research. The density of pictograph sites found along Camas Creek is notable and their locations suggest interesting departures from simple economic explanations. Sayers, Daniel [225] see Riccio, Jordan M.

Research in the Cook Islands has established that the sweet potato, a new world cultivar, was introduced into Polynesia by AD 1000. But how did it get there? Here, we consider evidence supporting the possibility of human transfer. The words "comal" and/or "cumal", similar to the Polynesian "kumara", were used by the Cañari people of Ecuador, sweet potato cultivators whose territory once stretched from the Gulf of Guayaquil to the Andean highlands. In addition to the sweet potato evidence, this paper considers other factors pointing to the Gulf of Guayaquil as a possible locus of trans-Pacific contact. Scarborough, Vernon (University of Cincinnati) [153] Discussant Scardera, Francis, Laurie Rush (US Army, Fort Drum), Margaret Schulz and Randy Amici [89] Consideration for astronomically-aligned stone features in the Northeast The oral histories and lore of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) people are filled with astronomical references, yet the archaeological record barely acknowledges their presence. Developing a protocol to identify and acknowledge the manifestation of these sites in the Northeast landscape is critical. This paper focuses on the results of archaeological fieldwork methods employed to document a possible astronomical feature in the landscape in Jefferson County, New York. The importance of fostering native consultation and participation in this process is emphasized. Aligning the landscape with the heavens is essential, but aligning these sites to the native cognitive universe is even more important. Scarry, Margaret (Univ. of North Carolina) [250] What can Plants and Plant Data tell us about Seasonality? In most environments, plants have cyclical rhythms of flowering, fruiting, storing energy for spring growth, etc. Because nuts, grains, and fruits are ready for harvest at predictable times, plant remains from archaeological sites seem likely candidates for estimating season(s) of occupation. Unfortunately, the potential to dry and store many plants confounds this issue. This paper considers how (and if) the harvesting periods for plants represented in archaeological sites on the Georgia Bight and in the broader Southeast can be combined with considerations of labor allocation and other archaeological data to provide clues about seasonality for episodic and year-round occupations. Schaafsma, Hoski (ASU) [44] Manipulated Landscapes and Altered Soils: Squeezing Water Out of a Dry Landscape Perry Mesa, in south-central Arizona, has a long history of sequential human occupations. In the late 1200`s an agrarian people settled the mesa and transformed hundreds of acres of grassland into an extensive system of dry-farming features. This study examines dry farming water management at multiple scales, from individual features to the complete landscape. Their use of numerous watersheds and feature types increased area-wide water retention, while manipulation of soil textures within individual features improved small-scale conditions. The success of these techniques is manifest in the range of crops produced, from domestic maize, agave and cotton to native crops. Schachner, Gregson (UCLA) [235] Ancestral Pueblo Settlement Dynamics in the Petrified Forest of Arizona Recent archaeological survey in the Petrified Forest of Arizona provides an opportunity to reexamine ancestral Pueblo settlement dynamics in this iconic region. Surveys by National Park Service and UCLA archaeologists have documented apparently continuous

ancestral Puebloan occupation dating from A.D. 200 to 1400. This continuity contrasts sharply with surrounding areas, which were either discontinuously settled or occupied for only a portion of this period. Comparison of the spatial and architectural traits of Petrified Forest settlements to those in surrounding regions suggests that local settlement patterns were shaped by people and ideas from many parts of the ancestral Pueblo world. Scharf, Elizabeth (University of North Dakota) [74] Chenopods and People: Reflecting on the use of the Chenopodiaceae in North America This presentation analyzes existing information regarding the prehistoric use of plants from the Chenopodiaceae family in North America. Cases are reviewed for both hunter-gatherer and farming cultures, looking at a range of human activities and their intended and unintended consequences. These are compared and contrasted to produce scenarios in which humans and chenopods entered into coevolutionary relationships that could lead to domestication and cultivation, and the specific mechanisms involved in these long term interactions are explored. Schauer, Matt (UIC) and Micah Smith (Depaul University) [45] Life on the Frontier: Occupation of Inca Fortifications in Northern Ecuador In north highland Ecuador, the Inca Empire encountered heavy resistance from a society known as the Cayambe which resulted in a string of military fortifications known as Pambamarca. At Pambamarca, there are fourteen hilltop fortifications located in close proximity to one another. The occupation of these sites and the activities that occurred there has been poorly understood. Therefore, the Pambamarca Archaeological Project began a program of systematic shovel tests at each of these sites in order to determine the density and distribution of occupation and the multitude of activities that occurred. This paper presents the results of that program. Schauer, Matt [45] see Kling, Amber M. Scheel-Ybert, Rita Scheel-Ybert [142] see Caromano, Caroline F.

Bighorn sheep hunting complexes, conical pole lodges, and resident campsites speak to intensified mountain resource procurement. In this paper we discuss recent research in the Absaroka Mountains surrounding Yellowstone National Park that seeks to address the ways in which Mountain Shoshone people constructed a sense of place within what appears to be relatively new social landscapes of the late prehistoric and early historic periods.

Ancient occupations were recorded in forested environments on North Patagonia but only from Late Holocene times, there is a neat archaeological signal at the forest. Some researchers posited the hypothesis that at least two different populations coexisted in that moment, one at the forest and the other at steppe.

Schele, Elaine (University of Texas) [112] The Twin Mortuary Temples of Palenque: Applying Historical GIS to the Archaeological Records of Temples XVIII & XVIII-A Temples XVIII and XVIIIA were excavated in the mid 20th Century by archaeologists Berlin, Ruz, Segovia and Saenz. The buildings are largely unknown to the general public and yet, when explored, they contained several royal burials. The richly furnished tomb discovered in Temple XVIIIA was one of the most important ever found at Palenque. Reconstructing the excavation record through the application and display of GIS can help bring the discoveries out of obscurity and into public consciousness.

Schiffer, Michael (University of Arizona) [208] Discussant Schilling, Timothy (Washington University in St. Louis) [140] The Moorehead Moment: Monumental Architecture to Monumentality Research into the 13th century Moorehead Phase at Cahokia reveals the reorganization of the Cahokian polity with leadership strategies shifting away from the traditional corporate base toward politics surrounding the circulation of precious items among a limited number of people. During this time the way the Cahokians used the landscape changed. Most notably, the Cahokians capped Monks Mound and erected a palisade enclosing the mound and the Grand Plaza. Usually these events are viewed as two separate acts. However, to understand this seminal time in Cahokian history we need to see these actions as connected and having implications that reverberated across the Mississippian world. Schindler, Bill (Washington College) and Aaron Krochmal (Washington College) [88] Finish Your Plate! Rethinking Relative Utility Factors to Better Model Resource Potential in Prehistoric Diets Optimal foraging models often rank individual resources based upon relative utility factors. These evaluations influence archaeological interpretations of prehistoric settlement, diet, subsistence selection and utilization. However, researchers calculating this factor are often drawing from a modern context where perspectives of diet and nutrition have little semblance to the past and run the risk of resulting in erroneous resource ranking. This paper attempts to shed itself of biased notions of "edibility" and demonstrates how, utilizing a combination of ethnographic and experimental research, calculations of "potential" relative utility can be quantified for the white-tailed deer. Schirack, Maggie (University of Montana), Lucy Harris, and Michael Wanzenried (University of Montana) [39] An Examination of Lithic Technological Responses to Subsistence Resource Intensification at the Bridge River Site, British Columbia: 1800-1100 BP Lithic technological systems are structured by and responsive to changes in subsistence, mobility, and raw material availability. Though much work has been done documenting the relationship of lithic technologies to these and other variables, less attention has been focused on documenting the more subtle effects of subsistence resource intensification on lithic technological systems. In this paper we will use a variety of data derived from the Bridge River housepit village in south central British Columbia to test the hypothesis that processes of subsistence intensification impacted aspects of production, use, maintenance, and reuse of lithic tools.

Preservation and management challenges are discussed for the Old Spanish Trail and El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro, where collaborative efforts have turned up 18th century inscriptions, rediscovered packtrain routes through the Mohave, mapped cobbler's nails from shoes worn out on desert crossings, created trail steward programs, formed preservation alert networks, developed innovative mitigation programs, and brought attention to hundreds of historic trail resources. [130] Discussant Schleher, Kari (University of New Mexico) and Marit Munson (Trent University) [200] Ceramics and Rock Art in the Northern Rio Grande: A Comparison of Design Changes in ceramics and rock art after A.D. 1325 are often thought to reflect new religious practices in the Northern Rio Grande. Our analysis suggests that designs on these two types of media differ considerably. Bounded geometric designs, which are typical on ceramics, are quite rare in rock art. Although there is overlap in the iconography on the two media, mode of representation differs greatly. This suggests that two different groups were likely involved in producing the designs. We argue that design differences may have wide-reaching implications for social networks and practices of production in this region. Schmader, Matthew (City of Albuquerque) [119] It`s All About Space: Two Case Examples of Site Structure Examining spatial organization and site structure have been guiding principles of processual archaeology for over 30 years. Lew Binford emphasized the need to document the distribution and characteristics of features and artifacts at varying scales to explain site formation and contents. Two case examples from central New Mexico illustrate the lasting power of Binford`s approach. One case examines interior use of space and segregation of different activity areas in eighth century pithouse structures. The other case details the patterning of metal and lithic artifacts found in relation to walled architecture at a battle site from the Coronado expedition of 1540.

The El Paso phase in the Jornada Mogollon region is known primarily from the excavation of a handful of large villages and other smaller residential and logistical sites. This paper will describe FB 9122 and its constituent elements, make comparisons with other El Paso phase sites in the Jornada region, and suggest productive directions for future research in the post-A.D. 1130 Mogollon region as a whole.

The project presents a relatively rare opportunity to examine a cross-section of archaeological sites within a portion of the Midwest. In this study, I examine the results of the Phase I archaeological surveys in Ohio focusing on prehistoric sites. The study will use GIS to examine the types of sites identified, occupation periods, and geographic settings to explore changes in regional settlement patterns over time. Schneider, Joan (California State Parks, Colorado Desert District) [216] Testing the Assumptions about Bedrock Processing Features: What have we Learned from Residue Analyses? Archaeologists have begun to experiment with types of residue analysis to test functional assumptions about bedrock processing features. Bedrock features such as mortars, basins, slicks, rubs, and anvils are very common and highly visible in many regions, yet little empirical data are available regarding functions. Functional interpretations based on ethnography, personal memories, and environmental contexts are insufficient means of examining the economic, ideological, and social complexities represented by these features. I will examine available types of residue analysis and applications to bedrock features, as well as synthesize data that have been derived from analyses and suggest directions for future research. Schneider, Seth [239] see Richards, John D. Schneider, Tsim (UC Berkeley) [114] Intrusions and Refuge at Shell Mounds in Colonial San Francisco Bay, California Historic deposits are documented at some shell mounds in the San Francisco Bay, but they are poorly understood. One major issue is that centuries of natural and cultural modification have altered most mounds, especially their top deposits. Therefore, interpretations of site use are often limited to prehistory. In this paper, however, I explore historic practices of intrusion at three intact shell mounds used as places of refuge by hunter-gatherers fleeing Spanish missions. I bring to bear issues of intrusion and persistent places in my examination of long-term cycles of site use and abandonment before, during, and after European contact. Schoenfelder, John (UCLA) [246] Of Kites and Poles: Site Documentation via (Very) Low-Altitude Aerial Photography in Skagafjordur, Iceland Alongside remote sensing and more traditional means of excavation mapping, kite- and pole-mounted digital cameras were used to take vertically-oriented photographs of two sites excavated during the Skagafjordur Archaeological Settlement Survey. This presentation discusses methods, experimental refinements, and uses for the results. While both kite and pole methods had (often complementary) strengths and limitations, each was effective and ultimately efficient in terms of cost and time. The photographs provided an immediate aid to tactical planning as well as a permanent record of exposed and removed contexts, with benefits amplified by post-processing and integration into a GIS. Schohn, J (University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill) [7] Another Step Removed: How NAGPRA further Disenfranchised non-Federal Tribes Prior to NAGPRA, archaeologists worked to varying degrees with non-Federal tribes. NAGPRA, however, has given archaeologists an excuse to ignore tribes they once worked with, leaving members of non-Federal tribes powerless to protect their ancestral remains without the assistance of (often unwilling) Federal tribes. This paper examines how tribes in South Carolina have attempted to work around the impediments put in their way in the 20 years since NAGPRA.

All sites are located on Holocene and late Wisconsinan landforms of the Salt River and its tributary, Grassy Creek, including: fluvial terraces, alluvial fans, and coalesced bar and terrace landforms. Cultural deposits from the sites date the sediments to the early through late Holocene.

Nelson (Arizona State University) and Steve Swanson (EPG) [192] Disentangling Archaeological Systematics in the Mimbres Region after A.D. 1130 Research in the post-A.D. 1130 Mimbres region has focused on a number of "phases" defined by disparate sets of temporal, geographic, ceramic, and architectural characteristics. Here, we summarize time-space systematics in current use, emphasizing the relationships between different phases, and their links to broader Southwestern developments. The geographic and temporal scale at which Postclassic period variability has been perceived has profoundly influenced our understanding of this time period; its separation into phases appears meaningful in some areas, but is highly problematic in others. Disentangling these classifications will greatly improve our understanding of what regional diversity in this period represents.

By analyzing lead artifacts found at colonial-era sites in Texas and Oklahoma, the intricacies and ramifications of an emerging global-scale market in firearms and ammunition are revealed. The trend is most vividly demonstrated at the Spanish mission of Santa Cruz de San Sabá, destroyed in 1758 by an alliance of Norteño tribes brandishing French firearms. At this site, bullets made from European, Mexican, and Mississippi Valley lead speak to the violently explosive clash of cultures which occurred here.

(Kenyon College) and Patricia Urban (Kenyon College) [65] Seeing Culture through Instantiated Behavior: Examples from Late and Terminal Classic Southeastern Mesoamerica In recent years, archeologists have turned to examinations of material culture as a window into the symbolic aspects of culture, structured behavior, and the enactment of habitus. In this presentation, we will examine instantiated behavior from the perspective of Marcel Mauss` ideas about the social and the material. The insights gained will be illustrated with examples from work in Late and Terminal Classic contexts in northwestern Honduras. Schoville, Benjamin (School of Human Evolution and Social ChangeArizona State University) and Kyle Brown (SACP4/University of Cape Town, South Africa) [129] Frequency and Distribution of Edge Damage on Middle Stone Age Lithic Points, Pinnacle Point 13B, South Africa and from an Experimental Calibrated Crossbow Convergent-points are often the dominant tool type in many MSA assemblages. Although damage to the lateral margins of points is frequent, analytical methods for dealing with edge damage patterns have not been applied to a complete MSA point assemblage. The assemblage edge damage frequency and distribution on MSA points from site PP13B, South Africa are compared to the patterns of edge damage formed on replicated points hafted to a calibrated thrusting spear. This recording method provides interpretive linkages to assemblage damage patterns and suggests points at PP13B were deposited after cutting activities rather than after use as thrusting spears. Schrader, Sarah (Purdue University) and Michele Buzon (Purdue University) [122] Investigating Activity Patterns: Osteoarthritis, Vertebral Degeneration and Musculoskeletal Stress Markers in Colonized Ancient Nubia Human skeletal remains from the New Kingdom, Egyptian colonial site of Tombos (1400-1040 BC) in Nubia, were analyzed for signs of osteoarthritis, vertebral degeneration and musculoskeletal stress markers. This multi-dimensional, three-fold approach investigates activity patterns and markers of occupational stress, both of which are highly influenced by long-term, physically demanding, repetitive activities. These data directly relate to issues of social identity and questions regarding the function of this community within the Egyptian empire. A low level of activity, due to a hypothesized administrative and middle-class lifestyle, was reflected in the Tombos sample. Schreg, Rainer [184] see Fisher, Lynn E. Schreiber, Katharina (University of California - Santa Barbara) [145] A brief History of Wari Studies The history of Wari studies is briefly summarized. Our current state of knowledge is a balance between the rapid accumulation of new data and the waxing and waning of different interpretive scenarios. It argued that Wari must be viewed holistically, not from the perspective of a single site or region, and that our models must take into account the fact that our data are still far from complete.

The presence of pig specimens at many of the farmsteads, even after 1300 AD, is quite remarkable. Also interesting is the paucity of older sheep remains, which is in stark contrast to the Myvatan area. Schriever, Bernard (Museum of Texas Tech University) and Barbara Roth (The University of Nevada, Las Vegas) [128] Pithouse Retirement and Dedication in the Mimbres Mogollon

Region The Mimbres Mogollon region of southwestern New Mexico has been a key area where evidence of ritual dedication and retirement of communal structures has been found. We present data that extends these activities to domestic contexts, documenting the ritual retirement of several Late Pithouse period structures and evidence for the incorporation of dedicatory objects during pithouse construction. These data suggest that symbolic activities associated with construction and abandonment were important components of Late Pithouse period occupations and discuss the implications of their presence in domestic contexts. Schroeder, Bryon [171] Conflict on the Northwestern Plains The topic of warfare in Northwestern Plain`s hunter -gatherer past is not the topic of major discussion. However the evidence of warfare, or at least violence, does exist and has been mentioned in analysis of the region`s human remains, rock art, and site morphology. A single butte-top defensive site known as the Alcova Redoubt located in central Wyoming will be placed into this already existing evidence of violence on the Northwestern Plains. Conclusions will be drawn on the rapid period of social reorganization that likely lead to the increase of violence occurring around European contact on the Northwestern Plains. Schroeder, Sissel (University of Wisconsin-Madison) [59] Jonathan Creek and the Interpretive Potential of New Deal-Era Collections The legacy of New Deal-era investigations at Mississippian sites extends beyond their role in the construction of regional culture histories as new analyses tap the interpretive potential of these collections. The Jonathan Creek project in Kentucky, conducted near the end of the New Deal, provides an historical lens through which the development of innovative field methods and professional practices can be viewed as archaeologists shifted their focus from elites and mounds to the exploration of community layout and household archaeology. Reanalysis of architectural data at Jonathan Creek has revealed sacred and secular structures embedded within the fabric of the community. Schubert, Blaine (East Tennessee State University) and Russell Graham (Pennsylvania State University) [224] Clovis-Folsom Drought: Afloat with the Vertebrates The Younger Dryas, an abrupt climate shift, coincides with the transition from Clovis to Folsom cultural complexes on the Great Plains. At Murray Springs, southeastern AZ, C. V. Haynes documented a shift from drier conditions at the end of Clovis time to moister environments during deposition of the Black Mat in the postClovis interval. He extended these drought conditions, the Clovis Drought, from TX to SD and from CA to NY. Later, V. T. Holliday made an important distinction between drought and aridity. He then interpreted the environmental shift from Clovis to Folsom, in the southern Plains, as increasing frequencies of drought with overall warming but he did not detect an abrupt period of aridity. Vertebrate faunas from the US exhibit the warming trend during this time. They do not provide evidence for continental-scale aridity as implied by Haynes. Increasing frequency of droughts cannot be documented by vertebrate faunas until there is a more finely dated faunal sequence. It does appear that Bison herds may have been smaller on the Great Plains until sometime after the Younger Dryas. Schuermann, Ryan (University of Texas at Austin) and Charles D.

Schuldenrein, Joseph (Geoarcheology Research Assoc) and Michael Aiuvalasit (Geoarcheology Research Associates) [252] Ancient Landscapes and Settlement Along the Millennium Corridor The range of site types and depositional contexts along the Millennium corridor is varied and complex. The Phase III sites included settings in classic trunk stream floodplains as well as more ephemeral occupations in upland, slope and ridge locations. These latter locations were unique as they overlooked an ancient glacial lake basin that was transformed into a series of peat beds during the terminal Pleistocene to Holocene transition. We examine both settlement geography and preservation aspects of the archaeological sites located in these diverse meso and microenvironments. Schuldenrein, Joseph [252] see Aiuvalasit, Michael J.

Surprisingly, the stone tool collections associated with these remains were never published. As part of the renewed excavations at the site, this material was studied. Here we report on the results from both sets of collections. The assemblages are characterized by the relative rarity of tools in general and of stemmed artifacts in particular. The implications for the recognition of so-called Aterian assemblages and the supposed interstratification of Aterian and Mousterian assemblages in North Africa are discussed. [129] First Chair Schurr, Mark (University of Notre Dame) [257] What Bone Chemistry Tells Us About Angel Site In the tradition of innovation established by Glenn A. Black, the Angel collections are source materials for studies of bone chemistry. Stable isotope analysis and fluoride dating have been applied to human and non-human bones from the site. Human bone chemistry studies originally focused on understanding intra-site chronology and dietary variation. More recent studies have integrated Angel into a regional framework suitable for exploring intra-community interactions. At the same time, the chemistry of faunal remains is providing new information about the people who inhabited the site and the animals they lived with and preyed upon. Schutte, Michele (University of Wisconsin Milwaukee) [124] Analysis of Train and Street Car Trauma in the MCIG Collection As part of the UWM Milwaukee County Institution Grounds Cemetery Research Initiative a re-boxing effort was begun to stabilize the collection. As a participant, I became interested in a subset of the skeletal collection. Within the greater population a few individuals have documentation indicating the cause of death was the result of being struck by a train or street car. These individuals should have various indicators of perimortem trauma distinguishable from excavation damage, other unrelated traumas or skeletal anomalies. Comparisons of these indicators with contemporary train and vehicular accident data will assist in verifying the associated cemetery documentation. Schwarcz, Henry (McMaster University) and Phillip Walker (University of California at Santa Barbara) [122] Isotopic Paleodiet Studies of the Chumash: Evidence of Sex-

Based Diet Differences Isotopic data have been obtained from human skeletal remains at sites along the California coast, from north of Santa Barbara to Los Angeles. Analyses of the C-13/C-12 and N-15/ N-14 ratios in collagen show that the entire population consumed a mixture of high-trophiclevel marine carnivores (e.g. seal), and terrestrial foods including flesh of large herbivores. Males were systematically enriched in heavy isotopes, suggesting a higher intake of higher-trophic-level marine foods. Measurement of carbonate of bone mineral shows that males also consumed more fat than females; we suppose this represents preferential distribution of high-lipid-content foods (e.g., seal blubber) to males. Schwartz, Lauren (UC, Riverside) [258] Variation in Household Architectural Designs & Styles at the site of PVN647, Northwest Honduras The study of architecture has been well documented in Mesoamerican archaeology, however, little is known of architectural designs from within Southeast Mesoamerica. Furthermore, even less has been investigated with regard to household architecture and spatial arrangements. This paper will discuss recent research of household contexts at PVN647 within the eastern region of the Naco Valley, Honduras. Of particular focus will be variations of vernacular architecture, construction and site-planning techniques both within and between household contexts for this region of the valley, all of which hold the potential to further our understanding of cultural expression within this region of Mesoamerica. Schwartz, Steven J. [31] see James, Steven R. Schwarz, Kevin (ASC Group, Inc.) [179] A Jack`s Reef Horizon Settlement Cluster in the Central Scioto Valley Archaeological excavations for the REX-East pipeline project identified three sites in the Central Scioto Valley that provide evidence of Jack`s Reef Horizon occupations in floodplain and upland settings. In 1992, Mark Seeman proposed the existence of the Jack`s Reef Horizon in Ohio as the habitational aspect of the Instrusive Mound Complex. Very little professional research has been undertaken on domestic sites though. Radiocarbon dates confirm habitation associated with this late Late Woodland culture between A.D. 700-1000. Geophysical and excavation data reviewed in this paper indicate intensive habitation of small-scaled residential bases, secondary refuse disposal, and a flake tool lithic technology.

We analyzed 60 bifacial points identified at Soutfontein 1, an open-air site located in the Knersvlakte of southern Namaqualand. The majority were made on white-vein quartz, and the remainder on silcrete. Patterns of shape and retouch differ between the materials, and the high abundance of locally available quartz, the variation in retouch invasiveness, and breakage patterns suggest that quartz bifacial points were manufactured on-site.

Recent ethnoarchaeological data suggest that speleothem columns are particularly significant features. During the survey of the upper passage of Actun Yaxteel Ahau, the author documented evidence of intensive activity around two such columns. One was part of a larger complex that included a substantial chamber enclosed by a curtain of low hanging stalactites. At the base of some stalactites were pools where cave pearls formed and cave pearls were found deposited in cultural contexts within the cave. [148] First Organizer; [107] First Chair Scott, Douglas (University of Nebraska- Lincoln) and Peter Bleed (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) [171] Carbines and Cannon: Archaeological Investigations of the February 1865 Battle of Rush Creek, Nebraska Elements of Ohio and Iowa Volunteer Cavalry units pursued a large band of Cheyenne and Lakota following the Battle of Mud Springs in early February 1865. The soldiers caught the Indians at the mouth of Rush Creek, currently Cedar Creek, on the North Platte River in western Nebraska. As one solider quipped catching the band was not hard but there was a hard time letting them go. The 150 soldiers found themselves surrounded by nearly 2000 warriors. Long range small arms fire was exchanged until a mounted charge was made by the troopers. They failed to dislodge the warriors and a 12pdr Mountain Howitzer was brought into play that effectively ended the battle. Archaeological investigations of the contested landscape clearly demonstrate how the soldiers and warriors successfully employed landscape features to protect themselves in this battle resulting in minimal losses to both sides.

Genevieve: Revealing French Cultural Traditions on the American Frontier Established by the French in the late 1780s, the present town of Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, remained overwhelmingly French in character well into the 1830s, despite ever increasing numbers of AngloAmerican settlers. A persistence of French cultural traditions may be seen in its vernacular architecture, legal practices, language, and religion. Most of the material culture recovered archaeologically, however, is British or Anglo-American in origin. This paper uses architectural and archaeological evidence to explore ways in which we can "see" French traditions in the cultural landscape of town lots and the activities occurring there, traditions often overlooked on America`s western frontier. [125] First Chair Scott, Rachel (Arizona State University) [243] Disease Patterning in Early Medieval Ireland Scholars have long studied the occurrence of disease in early medieval Ireland, using specific data to create a general portrayal of human health. While historical annals document periodic famines and pestilences, human skeletal analysis reveals evidence for infection and systemic stress. This paper refines current understanding of health and disease in early Ireland by examining differences among communities across the island and among individuals within communities. How did social, environmental, and biological factors affect the patterning of disease? The consideration of such patterns elucidates more than health, also illuminating social interaction, gender identity, and lived experience in early medieval Ireland. Scudder, Kelley (University of South Florida) [170] Archaeological Revolution on a Small Island Nation in the Twenty-first Century: A Grass-Roots Approach to Cultural Resource Management on the Island of Nevis During the past few years on the island of Nevis, the efforts of a handful of community members and archaeologists have resulted in the development of a comprehensive community-based cultural resource management program that have dramatically changed the way in which archaeological sites are conserved. The impact of these

efforts extends well beyond the shores of this small island nation to nations throughout the Atlantic all the way to Africa. This case study examines how small island nation communities, with limited revenue can have a profound impact on the conservation of archaeological sites and heritage resources, locally and globally. Scudder, Kristen [5] An Investigation of Turtle Use at Isla Cilvituk, Campeche, Mexico Previous research in Mesoamerican fauna analysis has contributed insights into animal resource use, but Maya turtle use remains unexamined. Turtle shell is recovered from almost every Maya archaeological site and in some of these archaeofauna assemblages, out of the class of reptiles, turtle is the most common species recovered. The primary objective of my research is to establish an archaeological model of exploitation of the turtles recovered from Isla Cilvituk (A.D. 900-1525) that includes what species or families were recovered and used, methods of procurement and discard and finally, overall their relative importance to the Isla Cilvituk Maya. Seamont, Morgan (University of Colorado) and Maxine McBrinn (PaleoCultural Research Group) [118] Research Paradigms in the Desert West: Regions and Regimes Archaeologists working in the Great Basin and in the Southwest examine a past dominated by hunters and gatherers for much of its duration, where people contended with aridity, patchy resources, and topographic variability. Despite these commonalities, researchers in these two regions are strongly influenced by longstanding professional traditions and often rely on distinctive tool sets, even when posing parallel questions. While each research perspective contributes to our understanding of the past, using a variety of approaches creates a more robust and complete picture of the early peoples of the Desert West. Searcy, Michael (University of Oklahoma) [199] Contextual Variation of Mesoamerican Iconography in the Southwest Archaeologists have worked to define the relationship between Mesoamerica and the Southwest and how it affected Southwestern communities for decades. Using iconographical analysis of motifs found on pottery that was produced between A.D. 1200-1450, this paper examines how Mesoamerica may have differentially affected sociopolitical organization in the Southwest among the Salado and Chihuahuan traditions. I analyze variation in the types and distribution of Mesoamerican iconography associated with hierarchical and nonhierarchical communities in order to determine whether the integration of foreign symbols was implemented to promote group solidarity through religious association or to help elites legitimize their authority. Sears, Erin (University of Kentucky) [229] It`s the Little Things in Life: Ceramic Figurines at t he Midpoint of the Maya World The creation of Maya portable art, as exampled in ceramic figurines, can be viewed as a passive reflection of cultural norms or as a dynamic expression involving the negotiation of identity and the manipulation of cultural boundaries. At a simple level, the demonstration that figurines were made at one location and moved to another suggests contact between social nodes. When this movement is placed within the context of shifting relationships along different trade and riverine systems, the discovery of figurine fragments take a more active role.

projectile points may have been put, including ceremonial and medicinal purposes. This paper will discuss these varied functions and present a set of measures to more accurately assess the function of prehistoric projectile points. Finally, I use data on projectile points from the Northern San Juan region of the American Southwest to evaluate the utility of these measures for determining projectile point function. Seebach, John (Sul Ross State University) [21] The Acquisition and Use of Lithic Material during the Paleoindian Period in Trans-Pecos, Texas The Paleoindian occupation of Trans-Pecos, Texas may have been motivated by a single resource: lithic material. Early Paleoindians utilized many local sources, especially those available in the region`s northern half. Acquisition appears less regionally circumspect during the Late Paleoindian era. Extra-limital materials are found within the sample, minimally indicating previously visited quarries. Even still, the prodigious number of stone sources found within the geologically heterogeneous Trans-Pecos stymies the estimation of mobility ranges. The Trans-Pecos record instead implores us to model behavior at a scale beyond the de facto seasonal round that has come to typify Paleoindian research. Seeman, Mark (Kent State University) [176] Discussant Segura Llanos, Rafael and Izumi Shimada (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale) [18] Pachacamac as an Embodiment of the Water and Life Cycle Pachacamac, one of the most revered Andean huacas, is sited in a unique setting where three major bodies of water converge: the Pacific, the Lurín River, and the Urpi Wachak Lagoon. Temples built at different moments are situated to have direct visual access to them. The exterior configuration of the Old Pachacamac Temple emulates that of Spondylus princeps. These observations together indicate a close symbolic linkage with water. We examine archaeological and paleoenvironmental data from our recent research at Pachacamac for their interrelations and argue sacrificial and funerary practices at the site centered on life, death, and rebirth. Seinfeld, Daniel (Florida State University) [55] Carbon Isotope Analysis of Ceramics from Two Sites in Mesoamerica Bulk stable carbon isotope analysis offers a relatively fast and inexpensive method for determining the proportion of maize used in ancient vessels. Previous work has demonstrated the effectiveness of this method for determining maize use patterns between classes of ceramics from a single archaeological context, a midden at the Olmec site of San Andrés, Tabasco, Mexico. This paper explores the wider applicability of bulk stable carbon isotope analysis by describing results that compare maize-use patterns between different time periods at the Maya site of San Estevan, Belize.

By analyzing his catalogs we have recuperated valuable information on the characteristics and provenience of the objects, and more fully understand his work in developing a functional classification based on typologies that was influenced by the intellectual criteria of the time. In this paper we will explore distinct facets of this energetic collector, and will try to explain the ultimate fate of his holding.

The object is a rhyzoconcretion that has been transformed by drilling. It is similar in shape and size to tubular pipes occurring in various archaeological contexts across North America from Paleoindian to proto-historic times. This paper evaluates the possible function and age of the Lindenmeier object. Is it a Folsom pipe?

Basic demographic parameters such as MNI, age and sex are presented. Natural and cultural taphonomic factors, such as tool marks, breakage patterns and thermal alteration, are quantified to demonstrate the relative contribution of each. Comparison is made with highly fragmented human assemblages reported elsewhere in the Maya area where conflicting interpretations of violence and burial desecration have been made.

Serangeli, Jordi, Nicholas Conard (University of Tuebingen) and Utz Böhner (University of Tuebinge) [205] The Digging of the DB Pillar in Schoeningen ­ Lonwer Saxony, Germany Since July 2008 the last phase of excavation has started at the opencast mine in Schöningen. The aim of this logistically complex project is to save the "cultural landscape" before the bucket-wheel excavators destroy the layers. Remains from the iron age, the Neolithic and the Lower Palaeolithic have been saved and documented. We emphasize here the discovery of some wooden and bone artifacts in addition to many faunal remains from an interglacial between the Elster and Saalian ice ages. We integrate these finds with studies of the quarternary geology and ecology to contextualize the use of past landscapes. Serra, Mari (IIA-UNAM), J.

domestic contexts. Some of these instruments are represented in the Mural de la Batalla in Cacaxtla, where warriors carry obsidian knives very similar to those in the offerings from the buildings. There is evidence of local manufacture of obsidian blades and spearheads; however it is probable that the ceremonial knives came from other sites, implying the presence of a ceremonial exchange network.

But progress ended in the mid 1950s when the government cancelled archaeological projects at Atiquizaya by Wolfgang Haberland and Chalchuapa by William Coe. After a decade hiatus, research was revived by projects by Will Andrews at Quelepa and myself at Chalchuapa.

[218] Discussant Sharon, Gonen (Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University) [58] Reflecting on the Levallois Core Method in the Acheulian The presence of the Levallois core method has been documented in many Acheulian assemblages along the entire geographical distribution of the Acheulian. Discussion of the Levallois is hampered by the fact that the definition of Levallois cores and products is insufficiently precise and far from consensus. There is an obvious divergence between the Acheulian and the Mousterian Levallois. I will explore some of the features exemplifying this divergence and examine their potential cause(s) in light of the new data available for Acheulian core technology and through its comparison to the Mousterian Levallois as described primarily from the Levant and Europe. Sharp, Emily (Vanderbilt University) and Tiffiny Tung (Vanderbilt University) [137] An Accident Waiting to Happen?: Violent and Accidental Injuries among Wari and post-Wari Populations in the Central Andes The dissolution of the Wari empire ca. AD 1000 had a profound impact on the health and lifeways of former inhabitants, particularly in the imperial heartland, where there was an apparent intensification of violent conflict. This study examines how other facets of life were affected by comparing the frequency and distribution of postcranial fractures between a Wari and post-Wari site to document changes in physical activity patterns and violent acts. Results show a temporal increase in fractures of the arms, legs, and thorax, likely related to warfare and subsistence activities in highland terrain.

In this paper, we describe the specific iconographic connections identified between the two regions and offer our current thoughts on the changing nature of this relationship over time. While research is ongoing, a clearer picture begins to emerge of a regional iconographic style centered on Nashville. Sharp, William

[249] An Example of Shifting Archaeological Methods and Interpretation illustrated by Investigations of a Famous Kentucky Site Fox Farm is the premier archaeological manifestation of late prehistoric, tribal, village farming people occupying north central Kentucky for seven to eight hundred years prior to modern settlement. The site was referred to in several accounts and investigated by the American Museum of Natural History in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, James B. Griffin used materials from Fox Farm in his publication The Fort Ancient Aspect: Its Cultural and Chronological Position in Mississippi Valley Archaeology. This paper examines earlier, later, and the latest investigations to illustrate changes in archaeological method and theory. Sharpe, Ashley (University of Florida) and William Saturno (Boston University) [64] From Ritual to Rubbish: The Maya Zooarchaeological Record of San Bartolo, Guatemala Faunal remains from archaeological sites are a significant yet commonly overlooked source of information that provides unique insights into the social habits of a culture. This study was performed to examine these relations as they pertain to the Maya of San Bartolo, Guatemala, by analyzing the animal bones from the past 2002-2007 field seasons. Analyses focused on comparing taxa with their contexts during the site`s Preclassic and Late Classic occupations, in order to better understand how subsistence practices, tool production, and ritual behavior changed through time and across social strata.

Visual analysis of Middle Horizon ceramics indicates that Wari and Tiwanaku potters in the valley replicated the forms and styles of their respective heartlands. Data derived from LAICP-MS analysis at of sherds demonstrates that Wari and Tiwanaku ceramics can be chemically as well as visually distinguished. Comparison of these data with five clay groups identified for Moquegua suggests that although colonists from both states exploited locally available clays, the clay sources utilized by Wari and Tiwanaku potters were distinct.

These efforts revealed a 1.8-km roadway measuring up to 4 m tall with a number of interesting features, including a vaulted passage and associated structures. However, unlike the site`s other sacbeob, which connect major architectural groups, Sacbe 2 terminates in a single pyramidal mound atop a simple platform. Based upon the scale of the causeway and the nature of the associated architecture, it is believed that the components may have been used to conduct elite mortuary rituals.

The avocational archaeologists of the state have been instrumental in locating and recording the majority of sites on the state registry. The partnerships between avocationals, professional archaeologists, and Native Americans have had their ups-and-downs over the past century, but today there is a strong effort to work together on locating and protecting Maine`s archaeological heritage.

Shea, Holly (Central Washington University) [203] Projectile Point Typologies on the Columbia Plateau and the Archaeology of the Grissom Site in Kittitas County, Washington The focus of the study in progress is the examination of more than 300 projectile points from the Grissom site near Ellensburg, Washington. The analysis will include use of metrics and Carter's 2002 dichotomous key to assign point type as well as description of certain attributes of the points. I hypothesize that the collection will show a broad time range with heavy focus on the late Prehistoric period and extensive use of local raw materials. My analysis will determine the research potential inherent in the collection and will examine how the Grissom site fits into existing Columbia Plateau typologies. Shea, John (Stony Brook University) [58] Why Didn't Neandertals Make Projectile Weapons? Neandertals were effective hunters. Yet, for more than a century, archaeologists have searched in vain among Middle Paleolithic stone tool assemblages for stone and bone tools comparable to the projectile armatures used by recent humans. Neandertals` failure to develop projectile technology remains an enigma. This paper explores possible explanations for Neandertals' failure to develop effective projectile technology. It considers, and rejects, longstanding hypotheses of insufficient intelligence, biomechanical inadequacy, interpretations of hafted stone spear points as projectile points, and claims that Middle Pleistocene wooden spears were projectile weapons. This paper proposes a new explanation based on energetic and time-budgeting considerations.

Furthermore, the North American CRM predictive model is inadequate for predicting or explaining the locations of these sites. Here, several archaeological sites and their ecological contexts are described and mapped using GIS. GIS is used to create a unique predictive model for Dominica, which takes into consideration the highly varied ecological micro-niches, the extreme topography, as well as historical and cultural factors. Sheets, Payson (University of Colorado) [5] What Were the Maya Doing with All That Manioc at Ceren? Recent excavations at Ceren encountered manioc fields of various cultivators, where over 10 metric tons of tubers were harvested about a week before the Loma Caldera eruption. How were the tubers processed and consumed? One possibility is cutting, drying, and grinding into "almidon" powder, and some artifactual evidence was found in terms of a possible manioc processing toolkit. Another possibility is masticating and fermenting for the village ceremony that was taking place when the eruption struck. Yet another is local consumption, but that was limited by small population size. Another is transportation to other settlements, but that too was limited. Shelach, Gideon (Dept. of East Asian Studies, The Hebrew University) [95] Discussant Shelton, China (Boston University) [34] Food and Identity in the Iron Age Central Apennines: Paleoethnobotanical Results from the Sangro Valley Project An analysis of paleoethnobotanical material collected from an agricultural workspace dating to the 7th-5th centuries B.C. in the

Italian central Apennines has provided new evidence for the nature of subsistence and economy in this mountainous region. Previously, there was little direct evidence available to investigate how the preand protohistoric populations in this area negotiated their place within this difficult landscape; results now suggest that they were growing and eating a crop (bitter vetch) that has been regarded as fodder or famine food in richer agricultural zones. Because differences in diet contribute to the definition of distinct social groups, it is possible that the visible distinction in diet shown by the paleoethnobotanical remains may in part have underlain the social divisions historically evident between the highland (Samnite) and lowland cultures (the Romans, among others).

At sites with more complete evidence, similar structures have been c alled pithouses and have had a variety of interpretations.

Bringing together geographical and archaeological frameworks, this poster presents the patterning of late prehistoric housepit villages along the Mid-Fraser of British Columbia, analyzing the relationship between resource proximity and the distribution of settlement size. Past theories regarding emerging social complexity in the region suggest that the highly diverse socioeconomy, and large size of settlements such as Keatley Creek, are a product of the abundance of particular extractable resources.

[124] Analysis of Juvenile Remains from the Milwaukee County Poor Farm Cemetery In 1991 and 1992, 586 juvenile burials were recovered from the Milwaukee County Poor Farm Cemetery. The cemetery exhibits temporally and spatially distinct areas for burial of juveniles. Analysis of a 30% sample of juvenile burials from two temporally distinct areas was completed to compare age, preservation, and grave goods. The late 19th and early 20th century was a time of change in the way children were doctored and how labor was approached. Social programs were being used to actively reduce infant mortality. This poster contextualizes the apparent poor health of juveniles in a time of increasing health awareness.

This manufacturing process is compared to those of the earlier Moche and Sicán cultures to define a possible north coast technological style and tropical shell use pattern and value.

Major characteristics include the use of flint slabs as cores and the serial production of central blades, cortical blades and naturally backed knives in a single reduction sequence with follow-through blows. This efficient manufacture of pre-Mousterian end-products with a predetermined shape is in the heart of the Amudian industry and is considered an aspect of modern human behavior as early as 400 kyr ago. Shimer, Carol [211] see Edwards, Susan R. Shipton, Ceri (Monash University) [256] The Evolution of Skill in the Acheulean The origins of mode 3 prepared core technology have been highlighted as a critical watershed in the evolution of hominin cognition; however prepared core technologies are actually widespread during the Acheulean. Experiments indicate that mastery of elementary movements presents the greatest challenge in knapping. In the case of Acheulean bifaces, striking sufficiently invasive flakes to thin the tool without breaking it requires lengthy practise and is only achieved by the most skilled modern knappers. Using between assemblage differences in the thickness to width ratio of bifaces, we argue that there was an evolutionary trajectory for increasing skill during the Acheulean. Shirar, Scott (University of Alaska Museum of the North), Jeff Rasic (University of Alaska Museum of the North) and Pat Druckenmiller (University of Alaska Museum of the North) [79] A Synthesis of Prehistoric Dog and Wolf Remains in Alaska Past studies highlight the important roles that dogs played in prehistoric cultures. They were used not only for hunting but also as pack animals, sentries, and even as a food source. The importance of domesticated dogs in Alaska historically and during the last 500 years is undeniable. However, there is scant evidence for dogs in Alaska

prior to the Late Holocene despite evidence suggesting the first colonists of North America brought dogs with them. This paper synthesizes the current evidence regarding dog domestication in Alaska and compiles radiocarbon dates for dog and wolf remains (including one new specimen) found throughout the state. Shock, Myrtle (UC Santa Barbara) [47] Archaeobotanical Remains from features at Lapa dos Bichos: The Role of Plants in the Diet of Brazilian 'Agriculturalists' Dry conditions in southeastern Brazilian rock shelters have resulted in excellent preservation of archaeobotanical remains. The prevalence of domesticated and native plants was examined in twenty five features, from the site of Lapa dos Bichos, resulting in a detailed characterization of diet from 500 to 2500 BP. The results indicate that native plants remained as a large portion of the diet. Thus our record of the transition to agricultural practices in this region is more detailed and suggests a mixed economy.

In only a few hundred years, Clovis points spread throughout the continent, but the archaeological record provides few clues of how they traveled so far, so fast. In this study, we analyzed flake scar patterns of Clovis points using 3D laser scanner models and digital morphometrics. Clovis points from different sites exhibit greater bifacial uniformity than those replicated by a single modern knapper, indicating that Clovis manufacturing technology was not easily copied and most likely required direct transmission of knowledge between groups.

Short, Laura (Texas A&M) and Laura O'Halloran (Texas A&M) [71] Acorn processing in Texas Depending on how one counts, there are over 200 species of oaks in North America. The oaks` defining feature is the acorn. This hard little fruit has provisioned many different groups throughout North America for millennia prior to European contact. This poster explores acorns as a food source, and their use among pre-Columbian Texans in particular. Significantly, there is very little direct archaeological evidence for acorn consumption--research relies on a combination of ethnographic data and the presence of processing tools and/or preserved acorn shells. Residual acorn starch may provide strong direct evidence of acorn processing. Shurack, Nikki (National Park Service) [37] The Role of Ceramic Stylistic Variation in an Aggregated Setting in Southwest Colorado The nature and extent of group interaction throughout the transition to more complex social arrangements during the Pueblo I period in the Southwestern Colorado region remains poorly understood. This research examines ceramic stylistic variation in an aggregated environment dating to AD 750-850 near Durango, Colorado. Excavation of over 80 pit structures yielded nearly 100,000 ceramic sherds, including 80 intact or reconstructable white ware bowls. Analysis of design elements, structure, and layout reveal clues about the ethnic identity of converging groups. Changes in design style reflect changes in the manner of group interaction over time. Shuttleworth, Andy (University of Liverpool), Larry Barham (University of Liverpool) and Susanne Shiltz (Oxford University) [27] Latitudinal Trends in Hunter-Gatherer Societies An analysis of over 30 hunter-gatherer societies from different climatic regions has highlighted several behavioral trends which are

ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 75TH ANNIVERSARY MEETING

linked to the latitudinal placement of a society. The analysis highlights specific behaviors such as kinship, art expression and spatial use which have not previously been linked to latitudinal location, and supports the work of Oswalt (1976) and Roscoe (2004). This paper emphasizes how latitude acts as a predictor for hunter-gatherer behaviour, and proposes how this variable can be used for modeling the behaviors of prehistoric populations of H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis.

Sievers, Christine (University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, SA) [151] Experiments with Fire and Carbonization of Buried Seeds Large frequencies of carbonized sedge nutlets were found in a dry shelter, Sibudu Cave, South Africa, that was occupied between 77,000 and 35,000 years ago. The nutlets were probably part of reed bedding that became burnt, perhaps post-depositionally. Experimental fires were designed to test the hypothesis. Below ground temperatures were recorded for different fuels, matrices, wind and ambient temperatures. Buried plant material carbonized at temperatures even as low as 160 °C when these were sustained for several hours. Thus fires built above ancient occupation floors can serendipitiously carbonize and preserve seeds and other plant material long after its deposition. Sievers, Colleen (BLM Rock Springs Field Office) [223] I can hardly give you an idea of this wonderful place. The South Pass Area Historical Study was the first comprehensive analysis of historical documentation combined with intensive field analysis of 19th century activities along the trail ruts of the Oregon, California, Mormon Pioneer, and Pony Express National Historical Trails. The study resulted in the documentation of 108 miles of historic trail with more than 90% of the trail being easily identifiable with intact trail setting much as it was 150 years ago. South Pass played a critical role in the lives of half-a-million ordinary Americans between 1840 and 1870 on their way to new homes in the West.

Although these influences can be seen throughout the archaeological record, North American travelers currently experience it at an accelerated pace. Increasing costs of living, high gasoline prices, job loss and other economic stresses, intensified constraints across political borders, and city and rural infrastructures are altering the way people travel, and their destinations, work or otherwise. In addition, cultural changes, such as views on recycling and litter, alter the archaeological record. Silverstein, Jay (JPAC/U of Hawaii), Daniel Jones (University College London) and Robert Littman (University of Hawaii) [92] Archaeology in the Nick of Time: Saving Graeco-Roman Thmuis, Egypt The surviving ruins at Tell Timai represent nearly an entire city with a history ranging from the dawn of Hellenistic Egypt to the coming of Islam. The once prominent Nile Delta center of trade, manufacturing, and politics amazingly still stands as a jumble of mudbrick buildings. Yet these structures which have endured so much history are yielding with ever-increasing rapidity to encroachment from the neighboring towns. Work begun in 2009 offers a hope of respite from the pending destruction and new insights into the organization of religion and economy of the Delta in Late Antiquity.

Simborth, Erika [188] see Burkholder, Jo Ellen Simek, Jan (University of Tennessee) [104] Dark Pathways: Prehistoric Cave Art as Ritual Framework Detailed documentation in a number of southeast US prehistoric cave art sites has shown that these sites are organized in content and location on a cave-wide scale, suggestive of sequential or processional utilization. These cave art sites were not passive art expositions but rather active places where complex ceremonies were carried out and rituals performed. Similar organizational characteristics are present in the earlier cave art from southwest Europe, suggesting similar, active utilization of those caves in some of humanity`s earliest ritual performances . Prehistoric cave art, thus, had both aesthetic and functional importance in these two cases. Simek, Jan [62] see Blankenship, Sarah A.; [22] see Sherwood, Sarah C. Simmons, Alan (University of Nevada Las Vegas) [186] The Earliest Prehistory of the Mediterranean Islands--New Developments from Cyprus Akrotiri Aetokremnos is a late Epipaleolithic site on the island of Cyprus that was excavated some 20 years ago. It is a contentious locality since it is currently is one of the oldest well-documented sites in the Mediterranean islands, and, more controversially, we have claimed that it represents a rare Pleistocene extinction scenario that directly implicates humans and pygmy hippopotami. Recent investigations on the island have claimed contemporary or even earlier sites, and new studies at Aetokremnos itself have provided additional data. Particularly significant is evidence for the presence of human-imported pig at the site. This report summarizes these recent developments. Simmons, Scott (University of North Carolina Wilmington) [139] Dispositions of the Dead: Spanish Contact Period Burial Patterns in the Southern Maya Lowlands Human burials examined at the ancient Maya site of Lamanai, Belize provide some insights into the impacts of Spanish colonialism on traditional Maya lifeways. In a great number of instances the Maya of Lamanai were buried in one of the site`s Spanish colonial mission churches. Yet in other cases community residents were buried away from the churches in more traditional positions typical of interments dating from precolumbian times. The research presented here examines the contexts and dispositions of burials dating from Spanish contact at Lamanai and compares these with burial patterns reported from contemporaneous sites in the Southern Maya Lowlands. Simms, Steven (Utah State University) [248] The Case for Fremont Villages and Cultural Complexity The Southwestern heritage of the Fremont, sedentism, and irrigation were acknowledged in the 1930s. Later efforts to distinguish the Fremont and more excavation indicated Fremont settlements were small, with little cultural complexity. These interpretations are suspect in their use of negative evidence and sampling. Arguments for Fremont complexity returned in the 1990s and evidence now exists for Fremont villages, residential cycling, and dispersed communities. The Fremont is part of a trend toward landscape scale pathways to inequality and complexity in social structure among farmers and some foragers in the Late Holocene Desert West, especially when populations peaked after 1500 B.P.

Simon, Mary (Illinois Transportation Archaeological Research) [83] Indications for Middle Mississippian Period Plant Use from the Orendorf Site in Illinois Settlement D at the Orendorf site is part of a large, Middle Mississippian fortified town that was catastrophically burned some time around A.D. 1250. Consequently excavations conducted during the 1970`s produced a wealth of macrobotanicals from a variety of contexts, including burned houses and internal pits. Analysis of these materials was re-initiated in 2009, and is ongoing. Here we summarize the results of work conducted to date and discuss some of the implications of these finds for understanding Middle Mississippian foodways, ceremony, and use of the local environment in the central Illinois River valley. Simon, Nora (College of Wooster) [184] The Road to Salvation: Medieval Pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral This study examines the material remains along the popular medieval pilgrimage route to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral. The goal is to catalog the towns, sacred and secular facilities, and natural features along the route from Winchester to Canterbury. Locales and features are analyzed in terms of Renfrew`s model for identifying sites of ritual importance, while the act of pilgrimage is described as a rite of passage using Turner`s theory of liminality and communitas. The entire route is analyzed as a ritual, or sacred, landscape of late medieval England. Simpson, Duane [150] see Scholl, Nathan C.

This interpretation has been hampered by an apparent occupational hiatus. A thirteen century analysis of settlement patterns from the two regions suggests that cultural continuity does exist and that the occupational hiatus is the result of research bias.

Some examples in this study show resources avoided and the complications, and the also benefits of hypotheses. This research supports previous hypotheses that humans reduced stone tools, flakes, and landscapes throughout the Plains and Rocky Mountains in the form of fauna such as snakes and birds similar to other areas of the U.S. Hunting techniques, culture history, and uses of scapula hoes demonstrate a connection to snake hunting, veneration of fauna established in past cultures, and hunting other fauna. The snake appears in the fluted symbol on Paleoindian points of past cultures.

Toward this end, extensive research

is being undertaken at the primary center of La Milpa, located in northwestern Belize. As part of a multi-institutional investigation, we are examining the role of elite lineages within the developmental trajectory of La Milpa. Ongoing research at two separate courtyard groupings within the site epicenter has shed critical insight into the long-term historical development and overarching political economy of this polity. Sindbaek, Soren (University of York, UK) [113] Broken Links and Black Boxes: Material Affiliations and Communication Networks In the Viking World Flows of communication in past human societies almost certainly had a character of complex, dynamic networks. Archaeology offers data, which preserve patterns of such networks, yet are anything but conventional sources on human interaction. Presenting fragmentary samples of material affiliations, their analysis resembles the famous 'Black Box' problem of electronics: Knowing only the outputs, can we reconstruct circuits that would generate the observed patterns? Issuing from a case-study of Viking-period interaction in the North Sea Region, this paper demonstrates how this problem can be negotiated by combining traditional, contextual interpretation of distribution maps with formal network analysis and modelling. Sisk, Matthew (Stony Brook University) and John Shea (Stony Brook University) [82] The Use of Cross-Sectional Perimeter in Modeling Stone Projectile Point Use This paper continues recent work analyzing simple metrics of stone points as potential indicators of use as projectile armatures (arrowheads, spearthrower dart tips), thrusting or hand cast spear points. Previously a ballistics measurement, tip cross sectional area (TCSA), has been the primary metric classification of use. Here we use a related measure, tip cross sectional perimeter. It is felt that this is a better overall measure because when an arrowhead penetrates, the target is sliced and not pulverized (as with a bullet). Experimental and archaeological data will be presented and compared with studies using TCSA.

Using standard ESR, 23 teeth have been dated. External dose rates were measured by volumetrically averaged geochemical sedimentary analyses and TL dosimetry. The teeth's low U concentrations ensure that the ages are independent of the U uptake rate. Layer 2 dated at 45 ± 3 ka (OIS 3), Layer 4 at 78 ± 3 ka (OIS 4-5a boundary), and Layer 9 at 74 ± 3 ka. Layer 1 ages varied, probably due to proximity to large éboulis blocks or post-depositional disturbance. Skinner, Anne R. [161] see Blickstein, Joel IB; [259] see Blackwell, Bonnie A. B.

In this study, two kinds of monkey pots from the Mirador Basin are examined ­ one from the Late Classic period (AD 680-800) and another from the Terminal Classic period (AD 780-830). I compare the functional, decorative, and contextual data for each type of monkey pot, infer the vessels` meaning to the ancient Maya, and determine whether these

Slater, Donald (Brandeis University & Robert S. Peabody Museum) [148] Seeking Xibalba: Preliminary Investigations of the Central Yucatan Archaeological Cave Project (CYAC) CYAC`s preliminary investigations have revealed a vast abundance of cave features within the Yaxcaba Municipal region of Yucatan, Mexico. The 50+ caves documented thus far, including caverns, rejolladas, cenotes, and rockshelters, represent merely a fraction of those visible via remote sensing. However, the data gathered from this sample is beginning to uncover interesting clues about the timeline and ritual use of the area`s caves. Evidence of cave/chamber termination, and the discovery of offerings, cosmograms, ritual pathways, rock art, and unusually placed architectural elements, presents new opportunities for the interpretation of socio-political and religious power relations among the region`s pre-Hispanic Maya. Slaughter, Mark (Bureau of Reclamation), Laureen Perry (Bureau of Reclamation), Pat Hicks (Bureau of Reclamation) and Renee Kolvet (Bureau of Reclamation) [211] Site Visibility along the Lower Colorado River Despite being arguably the most reliable source of water in the arid Southwest, research along the lower Colorado River has uncovered limited evidence of prehistoric Native American habitation. The ethnographic and ethnohistoric data indicate that significant populations were in-place when contacted by Europeans and later explorers. This paper explores natural and cultural processes that can help explain limited site visibility along the lower Colorado River. Slaughter, Mark [200] see Jensen, Eva Sload, Rebecca [107] The Iconography of the Underworld at Teotihuacan, Mexico Logically, it appears that the cave under the Pyramid of the Sun has ideological precursors outside of Teotihuacan because its initial use was quite early in the city`s history. The cave's construction apparently mostly contemporaneously and the lack of any known earlier ritual caves inside the city limits indicate beliefs that were established at conception and originated elsewhere. Formative period cave iconography is explored and similarities are found between Olmec and Izapa cultures and Teotihuacan in the way caves and the underworld are represented. That iconography is presented here, along with the practices and beliefs it suggests. Slobodina, Natalia (University of Washington) [194] Explaining Social Complexity in the Bering Strait Region While most fieldwork in the Bering Strait region took place within a unilinial evolutionary framework, recent reevaluation of the radiocarbon dates and other data provides a picture of a patchwork of different concurrent polities which were interacting through trade, warfare, intermarriage, or slavery. Mason (1998) uses Renfrew`s (1986) Peer Polity Interaction model in his attempt to explain the region`s complicated interactions, but this model does not explain their emergence. It is suggested that a contextual explanation, similar to Bunge`s (2004) "model of a model" will eventually be accepted for the development of peer polities and social complexity in the Bering Strait. [194] Second Chair [194] Second Organizer Small, David (Lehigh University) [78] Can we Develop a Structural Cross-Cultural Archaeology?

The buried Clovis lithic assemblage includes discarded tools and debitage that resulted from the production of bifaces, blades, and a variety of unifacial tools. This paper will review the lithic record at the Topper quarry to present aspects of the toolkit and technological organization used by th e site`s Clovis occupants. With the dearth of stratified sites in the Southeast, Topper adds new information about the late-Pleistocene occupation of eastern North America. Smith, Abigail (Washington University in St. Louis) [214] Archaeological Population Origins, As Revealed by Isotopic Analysis The remains of six individuals were excavated on Gorée Island, Senegal, a site with intense Afro-European interactions throughout the historic period. Strontium, carbon, and oxygen isotope ratios were calculated from tooth enamel to assess geographic origins. 87Sr/86Sr and d13C values for all but one individual cluster closely and suggest local, African origins. The divergent individual has markedly higher 87Sr/86Sr and lower d13C values than the others, possibly resulting from European origins. d18O discrimination was not marked. These results highlight the potential of isotopic analysis to answer questions of origin in similar heterogeneous contexts, especially with increased sample size. Smith, Angele (Univ of Northern British Columbia) [117] Archaeological Landscapes: Exploring Scale, Movement and the Politics of Spatiality Spatial analysis has long been considered fundamental to archaeology. More recently archaeologists espousing a more phenomenological approach, contributed to the growing literature of spatial theory by examine social landscapes at a more humanistic and intimate scale. I am concerned with space and spatial relations in understanding social interactions of power. Spatial/social relations are about spatial barriers, spatial opportunities, and/or spatial symbols that exist physically, socially and ideologically. Using case studies from both 19th century and contemporary Ireland, I will explore the use of spatially driven research concerning the politics and representation of spatial scales and the movement across these scales.

Smith, David [37] see Snow, Meradeth Smith, Geoffrey (University of Wyoming) [118] Through Bones and Stones: Assessing Early Holocene Models of Foraging Lifeways in the Great Basin Although scant, subsistence residues from early Holocene sites in the Great Basin suggest that Paleoindian lifeways may not have differed from Archaic lifeways as much as previously thought. Here I compare data from both periods and evaluate this possibility using a behavioral ecological perspective. Specifically, I test the hypothesis that early Holocene faunal assemblages differ in prey abundances and species diversity from later assemblages. I also consider the implications of this comparison together what is known about Paleoindian and Archaic behavior from source provenance studies and analyses of lithic technology. Together, these approaches offer a multidimensional view of temporal shifts in human adaptation in the Great Basin. Smith, George [237] Heritage Values in Contemporary Society Discussion of heritage in the twenty-first century must include the many voices representing the heritage sector and stakeholders, including but not limited to those in archaeology (university professors; and governmental, private sector, and public archaeologists), law, economics, historic preservation, education, tourism, and indigenous populations, to discuss how the past is valued and how such values can be defined, measured, and applied to public policy, spending, management, education (at all levels), education and training of heritage sector professionals, economic and sustainable development, and delivered services relating to a collective heritage in a manner that is accountable and includes public involvement. Smith, Heather (Center for the Study of the First Americans), Ted Goebel (Center for the Study of the First Americans, Texas A&M University) and Thomas DeWitt (Texas A&M University) [21] Digital Shape Analysis of Clovis Projectile Points In this paper we present the results of a shape analysis of Clovis fluted points from 24 sites across North America that are securely dated to the Clovis time period (~11,300-10,800 14C BP). Through shape analysis we can significantly increase the number of measured landmarks on an artifact and more precisely analyze its form to provide a more meaningful statistical expression of its shape in lieu of standard morphometric variables. Through our analysis, we can explore the major factors of variability in Clovis point shape across the continent, especially to determine whether that variability is geographically or temporally patterned. Smith, Jennifer (Washington University) [9] Prospects for Environmental Reconstruction for the Holocene of Dalmatia Regional paleoenvironmental reconstruction in the vicinity of the Danilo Bitinj and Pokrovnik sites is critical to an evaluation of the landscape and climatic setting of early agriculture in Dalmatia. Literature currently available from the broader Adriatic region presents conflicting accounts of the timing and nature of environmental change during the Holocene. Analysis of tufas and lacustrine carbonate sediments from the Krka river may provide an archive both of climatic change and of variation in soil erosion rates during the Holocene particularly relevant to understanding subsistence at Danilo and Pokrovnik.

A.D. 200900) are remarkable for their pottery caches of several to fifty or more vessels. These mass ceramic deposits have no historical

precedent and, as a result, have been the focus of much empirical work but also considerable speculation. Unsatisfied with a normative explanation that invokes elite mortuary ritual alone, we seek an alternative understanding couched in evolutionary theory of signaling behavior. We use this poster as an opportunity to model the social contexts in which signaling would be advantageous, given our understanding of Woodland period population and settlement dynamics.

Lined with cedar logs, the burial produced five closely associated engraved shell gorgets that brings together the Braden A/Eddyville style Castalian Springs gorget with two examples each of the Cox Mound and Nashville "styles." Recent excavation data, radiocarbon dates, and reanalysis of the entire 1891 Mound 1 mortuary assemblage suggest that Burial 34 was created about A.D. 1225-1275. This Classic Braden connection may have served as one inspiration for the Late Braden "spin-off" style reflected most clearly in the Thruston Tablet.

However, archaeologists seldom have the spatial and temporal data needed to actually track this process. In this paper we present results of multidisciplinary research into subsistence intensification at the Bridge River site, British Columbia. More specifically we examine variability in the use of different plants and animals over time recognizing that predation history may vary with predation context, prey target, and predator group. Consequently, we look for indicators of intensification in multiple data sets at the household as well as village scale.

I compare and contrast these two cities, focusing on topographic setting, urban layout and planning, monumental architecture, and residential neighborhoods. Similarities and differences between Xochicalco and Calixtlahuaca are used to generate hypotheses about the forms and functions of hilltop capitals that can be evaluated against other Mesoamerica examples, from Monte Alban to Utatlan.

Even though the Maya occupied a tropical environment, the growing season was not year-round and many environmental factors limited surplus production. Under these conditions, the maintenance of large agricultural populations required substantial investment in storage. Clearly, the political administration of tribute collection was fundamental to elite power structures and the organization of storage can reveal much about the Maya political economy. This paper will explore differences in storage strategies, how and where goods are stored and how stored goods are administered, as a way to reconstruct political structure among the Maya.

[127] Discussant Snow, Dean (Pennsylvania State University) [24] Making the Most of Cyberinfrastructure Problems in cyberinfrastructure development fall into strategic, tactical, and technical categories. I argue that we tend to focus on the last and neglect the other two, to the potential detriment of archaeology. Disciplines vary in what are considered data, the sizes of data sets, the ease of data acquisition, standards of confidentiality, when and how data should be made public, and opinions regarding what should be preserved over the long term. Current efforts to foster cyberinfrastructure in the social and behavioral sciences are dominated by social scientists who tend to work with large survey data sets on a narrow range of problems. While there is considerable variation in standards and objectives within anthropology alone, anthropological standards and practices fall largely outside the realm of the dominant social sciences. Standards and practices in archaeology are at particular risk of being marginalized as science moves forward in this critically important endeavor. This paper discusses ways in which archaeologists can establish links to other disciplines having similar strategic and tactical goals so that archaeology is not left behind in the larger cyberinfrastructure effort.

Mitochondrial DNA from dental samples taken from the NAN, Swartz Ruin and other Mimbres sites is compared with that from other ancient and modern samples around the greater Southwest to better understand how the Mimbres Culture fits into the region. Preliminary data from the southern outpost of the Southwest, the Casas Grandes (Paquime) site in Chihuahua, Mexico, was also analyzed to test the hypothesis that the Mimbres and/or other Southwest populations were related to Mexican populations further south. Preliminary results suggest the Mimbres haplogroup frequencies are similar to those found in other prehistoric Southwest populations. Sobel, Elizabeth (Missouri State University) [203] Contact-Period Shifts in Native Exchange Systems: Obsidian Evidence from the Southern Northwest Coast of North America Anthropologists widely assume that during the early decades of European arrival on the Northwest Coast of North America, the intensity and geographic scope of Native exchange systems increased. However, this model is based on ethnohistory and remains untested by archaeology. I address this problem with an archaeological analysis of pre-contact and post-contact obsidian artifacts from Cathlapotle, a Chinookan town site located along the Columbia River (Washington). The results support the assumed increase in the intensity of exchange, but not the supposed increase in the geographic scope of exchange activity in this region.

Beyond constituting a readily available dietary reserve, shellfish was exploited for the production of utilitarian and decorative items in a versatile domestic economy. This study presents the evidence for shell craft production at Muweilah in attempt to elucidate those technological strategies, interests and needs of the Iron Age societies, which conventionally remain eclipsed by the advances in metal tool production in the region of south-eastern Arabia.

Although it was originally assumed that these molluscs only served a dietary purpose, detailed analyses of the jute (Pachychilus species) shell collection from the ancient Maya site of Minanha, in West Central Belize, suggests that jute entered the archaeological record through a diverse array of processes, only some of which involved consumption.

Despite its rich archaeological record, large areas of shoreline have been inundated by rising Holocene water-levels, limiting understanding of Paleoindian and Archaic subsistence strategies and settlement patterns. To gain a better understanding of the submerged landscape of Rice Lake and identify areas of archaeological interest, a geophysical survey and sediment coring program was initiated. Quartz microdebitage dating to 10, 700 YBP was found in cores extracted adjacent to a terrestrial Archaic archaeological site.

Spatz, Ashton (Moraine Valley Community College) [92] An Examination of PPNB Marine Mollusc Shell Exchange Networks in the Southern Levant There has been speculation surrounding the mechanisms involved in the long-distance exchange of marine shell in the PPNB Levant. Thus, mollusc assemblages, including both Red and Mediterranean Sea shells, from several PPNB sites in the southern Levant are examined to access if they conform to a down-the-line exchange model. The shells are also analyzed to determine if they are being exchanged as raw material or finished products. Preliminary evidence supports the trade of shells via down-the-line exchange networks during the PPNB. However, the form in which these molluscs are exchanged appears to differ based on their source.

Carbon isotopes spike (~3) during the eruptive period then return to baseline values.

There were fewer settlements, including mound centers, and the overall number of residential structures also declined.

It also facilitated the testing of two hypotheses: first, the differential use of megalithic stones throughout the site and its surrounding areas may signify different communities at Uci, second, different investments in residential architecture can represent different socioeconomic statuses at Uci. Preliminary results suggest that the platforms with high numbers of megalithic stones have larger dimensions than platforms with few or no megalithic stones.

This paper summarizes temporal trends in land-use patterns and population settlement. Doing so requires analysis of key settlement configurations during these two periods and discussion of how pre-Angkorian populations organized themselves across the landscape.

Argosy Cordmarked pottery is defined as containing large and numerous particles of crushed limestone or grit, cordmarked exteriors, outward flaring rims and square or rounded lips. Based on the number and diversity of features and the type of ceramics, Site 12Fr336 appears to represent a series of short-term seasonal occupations, perhaps ceremonial in nature, during the terminal Late Woodland period (i.e., pre-Fort Ancient).

Both sites provide strong evidence for habitual large game hunting and similar patterns of prey age selection, as well as transport of high quality prey parts to residential sites. Small animal exploitation was limited mainly to lostcost/high-yield species. Different, at least at these two sites, is evidence for patterns of meat sharing on site based on tool mark evidence.

Stockdell, Eric (Indiana University), Dru McGill (Indiana University) [257] Excavating the "Potter's House:" Possible Evidence for Craft Specialization at a 14th century Angel Mounds Structure In 2005, the Glenn A. Black Laboratory of Archaeology tested several structures identified during a previous magnetometry survey. In 2006, extensive excavation of one such structure yielded extremely high densities of a variety of materials associated with craft specialization, including pottery trowels, unfired clay, and shell, as well as high concentrations of groundstone tools. C14 samples date the structure to A.D. 1325-1375, placing it within the Late Angel phase. Such a concentrated presence in one structure of materials associated with craft production provides great potential for the discussion of craft specialization during the 14th century at Angel Mounds.

Kam Manahan (Kent State University) [160] The View from Xuenkal: Geoecological and Social Determinants of Settlement Location at an Ancient Maya Center

The Northern Pitted Karst Plain of northeastern Yucatán, Mexico, presents numerous challenges for investigators exploring environmental and social factors that influenced past settlement locations. Traditional topographic analysis of DEMs (including slope, aspect, watersheds, viewsheds, etc.) is difficult because of low topographic relief. This paper explores multivariate analyses of georeferenced and geocoded high-resolution satellite imagery. These data are combined with geoecological and archaeological datasets, including ethnobotanical surveys, and spatial, temporal and architectural data on nearly 700 ancient structures, to reveal patterns of long-term human-environment interaction at Xuenkal and its hinterlands. Stoll, Courtney [150] see Erickson, Luke W. Stoll, Marijke (University of Arizona) [13] Es Nuestra Tradición: An Ethnographic Study of the Pelota Mixteca Ballgame and Its Archaeological Implications Analyses of ball courts tend to focus on their possible ritual meaning and function. However, the sociopolitical processes that made ball courts and associated ballgames so efficacious in Mesoamerica are still relatively poorly understood. Clearly, close archaeological, historical, and ethnographic investigation is needed in order to understand the implications of these prominent structures in political and community relationships. This paper will present the preliminary results of an archaeological survey and ethnographic study of the ball courts and the modern ballgame in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca and propose further avenues of research.

Through petrographic analysis, the material composition of ceramic artifacts essential for Shang bronze production--models, cores, molds, crucibles, and furnaces--have been determined for specimens excavated at Xiaomintun SE, a bronze foundry near Anyang. The results reveal a ceramic industry that was both diverse and sophisticated, with different recipes employed depending upon the functions the various artifact types were intended to perform.

Management accomplishments have focused on resource protection; surveys and documentation; scientific research; public education and interpretation; and creation of a management plan. Partnerships with universities and organizations, like Friends of the Agua Fria National Monument, have been invaluable. Recent research has explored conflicting ideas about the role of warfare and alliances in prehistoric societies and has fostered an innovative collaboration among archaeologists and ecologists. These efforts by scientists and citizens have transformed our knowledge of the prehistoric Perry Mesa Tradition. Stone, Connie [75] see Pedrick, Kathryn E.

The challenge was to clean and stabilize the diverse artifact types. Elsewhere, HDR/e2M was tasked with investigating a buried New Mexico site and to keep it intact. This required a noninvasive approach, delivered in a timely and efficient manner. In each case, HDR/e2M determined the best solution to meet the project challenges. Stoner, Wesley (University of Kentucky) [254] Estimating Political Boundaries in the Classic Tuxtla Mountains Political economic models for the Classic Tuxtlas region have been based entirely on archaeological excavation and survey at Matacapan and settlements within the Catemaco Valley. Recent survey in the neighboring Tepango Valley, which includes the large center of Totocapan, provides data to evaluate existing models of Tuxtlas evolution from a broader scale perspective. One of the fundamental steps to arriving at a synthesis of Classic Tuxtlas evolution is to delineate political boundaries within the broader Tuxtlas region. In this paper, I present a GIS-assisted model of political boundaries that generates testable hypotheses for the political economic composition of the region. [133] Discussant Storey, Alice [68] The Pre-Columbian Chickens of Chile: Re-evaluating the Assumptions of European Introductions It was long assumed, due to the absence of pre-Columbian chicken bones in the archaeological record of the Americas, that the first chickens in the region were those brought by Europeans. Recently the recovery of chickens from the pre-Hispanic site of El Arenal 1 in Chile has demonstrated that chickens indeed reached South America before Columbus. Given this new evidence some of the old ethnographic reports, oral traditions and recovered artifacts should now be reconsidered. In this presentation I will discuss the mtDNA, radiocarbon and isotopic evidence establishing the antiquity of the El Arenal chickens and how they are thought to be related to prehistoric Polynesian chicken populations. Then I will present some observations of early Explorers and Ethnographers to encourage discussion and debate about the distribution of chickens in the prehistoric New World and other potential sites of introduction.

For this reason, many Maya sites are located near these aguadas. Aguadas can provide a wealth of information concerning settlement patterns, water resource management, climatic variability and local environmental change. Aguada Hormiguero, a small natural depression located outside of the archaeological site of Xultun, will be examined in this paper within its cultural and environmental context. Excavation and sediment analysis were used in order to determine the extent of anthropogenic modification and environmental change. Stosel, Victoria (University of Alaska, Fairbanks) [31] Possible Applications of Optimal Foraging Theory On San Nicolas Island, California Optimal Foraging Theory provides a means to determine the relative importance of various shellfish and echinoderms in the San Nicolas Islander`s diet. The nutritional content of shellfish and echinoderms remains fairly consistent among the various species. Other factors such as meat yield and collection times indicate that optimal choices exist. Examining collection times, meat yields and caloric content assist in determining if predation choices were optimal or preferential.

Stotts, Rhian (Arizona State University) [184] Least-Cost Path and Viewshed Analysis of Copper Trade Routes in Late Bronze Age Cyprus The extraction and movement of copper figure prominently in models of the development of urbanized economy and society during the Late Bronze Age (1700-1050 BC) in Cyprus. This study uses GRASS GIS software to determine least cost paths between mining areas and coastal centers. These paths logically correlate with trading routes throughout the island, and are used to assess the possibility that some inland settlements served as redistribution sites. The function of other sites as inland forts also is evaluated by determining whether the least cost paths, as inferred trade routes, would have been visible from these fortified sites. Stout Evans, Rachel [217] see Mehta, Jayur M. Stovel, Emily (Ripon College) [121] Looking Closely at One in the Face of Many: Characterizing San Pedro de Atacama Ceramics New technologies not only present interesting opportunities to examine ceramic difference, but also allow us to examine and characterize individual ceramics styles more intimately. This poster explores chemical (LA-ICP-MS and pXRF) variation within a collection of San Pedro Middle Period sherds and contributes to debates on production decisions with respect to functional and formal subtypes. Stowe, Michael (Geo-Marine, Inc) [213] Preliminary Evidence for Ballgaming in the Jornada: Stone Balls from Fort Bliss and Beyond... This paper explores the ballgame tradition in the American Southwest, specifically, the discovery of numerous stone balls from prehistoric sites throughout the Jornada, with an emphasis on the Fort Bliss Military Reservation located in south central New Mexico. Due to a paucity of archaeological and ethnographic information regarding prehistoric gaming and gaming implements in this region, only limited inferences have been made regarding the function of these unique artifacts. This presentation will focus on the description of stone balls discovered on prehistoric sites throughout Fort Bliss and adjacent areas, and outline implications for future studies in the region. Straus, Lawrence (University of New Mexico) [177] Human responses to Younger Dryas in Cantabrian Spain During the Late Glacial Interstadial the classic Upper Magdalenian of Cantabrian Spain with its famous cave and portable art came to a gradual end. With considerable continuity in settlements, subsistence and technology, it was replaced by the Azilian, an Epimagdalenian tradition with widespread artifactual similarities throughout Atlantic Western Europe. Changes during Younger Dryas were subtle and muted in this southerly sector of the oceanic middle latitudes, both in terms of vegetation/fauna and with respect to human adaptive reactions.

However, the exhumation of 27 burials from a new site in the region (Santo Rockshelter) shows a variable pattern of mortuary practice, including amputation of limbs and head, use of neurocranium as receptacles, and cremation. These results suggest that previous reports overlooked the variability of mortuary practices in Lagoa Santa. Other Early Holocene sites in South America also present funerary practices including body manipulation, suggesting some similarities across the subcontinent.

Strawhacker, Colleen (Arizona State University) and Frances Hayashida (University of New Mexico) [138] Prehispanic Irrigated Soils on the North Coast of Peru: Preliminary Results from Soil Sampling on Agricultural Fields During the 2009 field season, soil sampling across the Pampa de Chaparrí on the arid north coast of Peru was performed in order to develop methodology and understand the impacts on the soil of different field patterning in long-term irrigated systems. Because soil sampling has rarely been undertaken at a large scale in prehispanic irrigated environments, this project represents a pilot study into productive avenues for understanding the impacts and legacies of long-term irrigation on fragile desert soils. This poster will introduce a new methodology for sampling in irrigated environments and provide preliminary results from the 2009 field season. Strezewski, Michael (University of Southern Indiana) and Robert McCullough (Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne) [219] Investigations at Fort Ouiatenon and Kethtippecanunk, Two FurTrade Era Sites in Tippecanoe County, Indiana Fort Ouiatenon and Kethtippecanunk were sites integral to the eighteenth century fur trade in the central Wabash River valley. Fort Ouiatenon was constructed by the French in 1717 and was extensively excavated in the 1960s and '70s. However, little effort had been made to investigate the historic Kickapoo/Mascouten villages that surrounded the fort. Magnetometry survey in these areas indicates clusters of anomalies, including numerous large, circular anomalies that are likely Native winter houses. Kethtippecanunk was a fur-trading town occupied by the Wea. Magnetometry and excavations at Kethtippecanunk focused on defining the site's boundaries and investigation of a fur trader's house. Strickland, Glenn [24] The Integration and Interpretation of Archaeological Data through Three Dimensional Multi-component Digital Spatial Modeling Parchman Place Mounds (22-Co-511) is a Late Mississippian mound group located in the Yazoo Basin of northwestern Mississippi. The area between the two largest mounds within the complex, identified as the A-B Swale, is digitally rendered into a three dimensional multicomponent spatial model. The completed rendering merges data from archaeological excavations, geophysical prospecting, and artifact analysis. The combination of these diverse datasets into a single integrated model serves to substantially increase the capability of spatial analysis and archaeological interpretation. Striker, Michael and Timothy King (Gray & Pape, Inc.) [239] Using Computer Modeling to Test and Explain Astronomical Alignments at a Mississippian Village For decades, archaeologists have attempted to document and explain the alignment of certain Native America architecture with astronomical events. However, while documentation is fairly simple, explanation is more complicated. Using computer modeling of astronomical events and three-dimensional GIS modeling, the authors tested the hypothesis that the builders of the Southwind site, a Mississippian village in southern Indiana, constructed their village to permit for the prediction and observation of events such as the solstice sunrise and sunset. The results indicated that while alignments existed, it is unlikely that such events could be observed as predicted. [252] Second Organizer Striker, Sarah (Arizona State University) [25] Reassessing Economic Dynamics of the Seventeenth Century Iroquois Beaver Wars The seventeenth century Iroquois Beaver Wars have been interpreted as attempts to gain control over the regional fur trade from Algonquian, Huron, and French groups. Although recent interpretations move away from purely economic motivations for these conflicts in favor of more nuanced explanations, Beaver War economics have not been received much rigorous attention. This study utilizes data from historic documents and archaeological

studies to find patterns in the movement of resources such as beaver pelts, European trade items, and captive and non-captive people to provide a more rigorous assessment of economic factors among the many that contributed to this conflict. Stroud, Amanda (New Mexico State University) [42] GPR Data From Hermosa, New Mexico This poster will focus on Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data and ground truthing from the town of Hermosa, New Mexico. Hermosa, a mining community, reached its peak in the late 1800s, and was often plagued with damaging floods. The GPR data was taken in the floodplain, where houses are believed to have been built prior to the floods. The GPR data, coupled with the ground truthing, will help us better understand the cultural and geologic history of this town. Stroulia, Anna and Susan Sutton (Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis) [106] Greek Archaeological Laws, Sites, and the Chasm between Past and Present Greek Archaeological Laws codify a conception of sites deriving from the century of classically inspired travel and appropriation preceding them: sites as national, continental, even global emblems, far removed from their surroundings. Thus it is that the Laws encircle sites with zones in which no farming or construction may occur, and prohibit eating, singing, and loud talking within them. This paper explores how such mandates create a chasm between past and present that explains the alienation and indifference many local residents have toward places so valued by those more distant. Struever, Stuart (Crow Canyon Archaeological Center) [215] Discussant Studnicka, Nikolaus [61] see Doneus, Michael Stull, Scott (Ithaca College) [219] Houses and Identity on New York`s Colonial Frontier Houses and their immediate landscape have long been recognized as being tied to identity and status. Two colonial houses, both National Historic Landmarks, in New York`s Mohawk Valley will be discussed to reveal how identity was constructed using house form in the mideighteenth century. These two houses, Fort Klock and Old Fort Johnson, are both stone, fortified houses, but are markedly different in form and layout. These houses parallel the differences between their builders, and show both ethnic and status differences expressed through built form. Sturm, Jennie (TAG Research) [85] Using GPR to Study a Historic Denver Neighborhood Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys were conducted in a downtown Denver parking lot to assess the location and spatial extent of archaeological features prior to redevelopment. The surveys mapped the foundations of a number of domestic structures. Amplitude slice-maps and reflection profiles show distinct foundations at various depths, indicating re-building phases and modifications to the layout of these structures over time. By combining the analysis of slice-maps and profiles with historic Sandborn maps available for the area, it is possible to address questions related to the demographics and changing dynamics of a turn-of-the-century Denver neighborhood. Styles, Bonnie (Illinois State Museum) [173] Impacts of Archeozoological Research in the Illinois River Valley The Illinois River valley is an innovative center for archeozoological research. By 1930, Frank Baker was already contributing his zoological expertise to studies of Native American resource use. Paul Parmalee introduced a strong ecological approach steeped in his understanding of animal behavior, and he also incorporated analyses of small-scale remains recovered through flotation.

Styles, Thomas and Edwin Hajic (Self Employed Geoarchaeologist) [173] The Broader Influence of the Geomorphology and Geoarchaeology Program at the Center for American Archaeology In the middle 1970`s, a Geomorphology program consisting of full time geologists, a lab and drilling equipment was established at the CAA as part of an overall program that emphasized the emerging interdisciplinary research approach in archaeology. In addition to program-wide contributions, the Geomorphology program influenced research further afield. Contributions include: moving geologists involvement forward in all phases of the archaeological investigative process, including pre-survey; developing a landscape-based approach, ranging from regional models of landscape evolution to geo-centric testing and excavation designs; and, demonstrating that the Holocene geology of large river valleys is not indecipherable, but rather ordered and predictable. Sugandhi, Namita [189] The construction and Destruction of Chatrikhera: Archaeological Conservation in Southeastern Rajasthan The Chatrikhera Research Project is designed to explore the ancient remains located in the village of Chatrikhera in Rajsamand District, Rajasthan. Initial observation suggests that deposits at this site date from the Chalcolithic Period (c. 3rd-2nd millennia BCE) up until the Modern Period.The archaeological remains under investigation are primarily located within the modern village, complicating research efforts, but also providing an opportunity to examine the relationship between past remains and present needs. This paper explores the concept of archaeological conservation by introducing the project and discussing the issues of preservation and destruction that inform ongoing research at the site. Sugiyama, Nawa (Harvard University) [64] Animals and the State: The Role of Animals in State-Level Rituals in Mesoamerica In Mesoamerica, animals participated in state level rituals which were active arenas where power relations were negotiated, constructed and embodied. Much of this negotiation was based on the symbolic and physical relationship humans established with these animals. Through a case study of a large offering cache discovered from the site of Teotihuacan and another example of an attempt by Maya kings to use animals in ancestor worship rituals at Copan, I will demonstrate zooarchaoelogical evidence of the ways in which the state controlled these symbolically loaded animals. Such fauna became central actors in the development state legitimation, warfare and sacrifice.

Defining all non-bureaucratized religions as shamanism and then linking all hunter-gather art to this poorly defined über-religion leaves one to conclude that the art is shamanic because it was produced in a culture different from our own, albeit using universal images. This paper argues for a style-based interpretive model that uses the specifics of cultural context to unravel the specific meanings of rock art traditions. To quote Margaret Conkey, "Without style we have little or nothing to say."

By teasing apart the chaînes opératoires of foodway materials, it becomes apparent that households may have departed from the consumption practices of essentialized cuisine while drawing from multiple relationships among the various stages of production and consumption of foodways-related materials. In other words, at different temporal and spatial scales, behaviors reflected in the material record refute notions about a creolized community that tried to diminish differences within the village.

[236] You Want Me to Dig...Where?: New Methodologies and Revised Interpretations of Prehistoric Quarries and Localized Raw Material Procurement Areas at Fort Campbell, Kentucky Prehistoric quarries have long been a focus of archaeological research, though understanding of prehistoric lithic raw material acquisition patterns has been largely restricted to extensively exploited resources such as Dover, Tennessee, and Flint Ridge, Ohio. Excavations conducted at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, since 2002 have documented a widespread, smaller-scale, extremely localized lithic procurement pattern that provides new perspective on traditional interpretations of prehistoric raw material acquisition. This paper presents revised methodologies employed during excavations, defines lithic procurement site types identified, and proposes that the majority of prehistoric raw material acquisition took place in a significantly more opportunistic manner than previously hypothesized. Supernant, Kisha (UBC) [181] Contemporary Community Disputes and the Production of Archaeological Knowledge: A Case from British Columbia, Canada In British Columbia, collaboration between archaeologists and First Nations is common. While this has many positive outcomes, including providing a more relevant and nuanced understanding of the significance of the past and the generation of archaeological knowledge, many of the areas in which archaeologists work is subject to contemporary disputes between First Nations communities. In this paper, I explore the ethical and epistemic challenges to archaeology when working in disputed zones, arguing that while building relationships in these situations is difficult, contemporary conflicts provide an opportunity for us to examine how we define identity in the past and present.

[225] Inferring Agency from Landscape-Scale Modeling of Archaic Hunter-Gatherers A landscape perspective approaches the reconstruction of agency from the top down, essentially inferring individual decisions from the social use of space preserved in the archaeological record. Sophisticated, computer-based techniques for modeling past landscapes have the potential to help elucidate some of the complex factors that influenced how past peoples viewed and used their landscape. However, making the leap to individual actions from social landscape can be difficult in the absence of detailed site excavation data. The case study described here evaluates the use of landscapescale contexts to provide a glimpse into past decision making among Shell Mound Archaic peoples. Surovell, Todd [224] see Holliday, Vance T. Surridge, Evan (UNC-Chapel Hill) [98] Domestic Economy and Lithic Technology in the Early Intermediate Period: A View from the Middle Moche Valley, Peru Despite increasing research on Moche social organization, little is known of the exchange and labor patterns that structured rural economies. Stone tools are a pertinent dataset in addressing such issues because they provide a window on varying productive activity between groups and through time. Here, I present research on lithic assemblages from three archaeological sites in the middle Moche Valley that demonstrate considerable variability between households and communities both prior to and after the emergence of the Moche polity. Positions within exchange networks, differences in status and ethnicity, and changes in the organization of agricultural labor are considered as contributing factors.

Some extremely successful; some disastrous. We focus on three issues that we believe are central to the future of ARPA: (1) Finding a trained, interested archaeologist to work on an ARPA case is difficult given competing management priorities and lack of funding; (2) The basic ARPA training that has been provided to patrol staff and archaeologists is inadequate and perhaps counterproductive; (3) Reactive investigation of ARPA violations has not been particularly successful. We discuss each of these issues in turn and offer potential solutions. Swanson, Steve (Arizona State University), Karen Gust Schollmeyer (Arizona State University) and Margaret C.

Data from excavation at three large Postclassic (AD 1130-1450) sites (Animas and Roadmap Villages, Phyllis Pueblo) and recent surveys indicate a diversity of architectural and ceramic traditions, community configurations, and settlement shifts. We explore linkages among post-Mimbres communities in the area to one another, their ancestral ties to Mimbres culture, and their connections to contemporary traditions across the US Southwest.

Combining archaeological and environmental data, an agent based computer model was created to simulate the decisions early farmers made and the effects they had on the environment. The Medlands research includes K-12 educational outreach developed in conjunction with classroom teachers.

Swanton, Kristin [180] see Salsgiver, Amy E Sweeten, Lena (Gray & Pape, Inc.) [252] A Cultural Landscape Across Time: The Mission Lands Historic District, Orange County, New York For many agricultural landscapes, the only constant is change. As a result, few historic architectural resources are likely to survive. Yet a landscape`s lack of traditionally defined historic resources does not preclude its historic significance. By examining archival evidence and documenting the extant landscape through field survey, photography, and GIS analysis, the means for gaining a fuller understanding of the cultural landscape emerge. This paper examines the characterdefining elements of the cultural landscape within the Mission Lands Historic District, and discusses the documentation methods used.

However, the notion of Mochica cultural conservatism has been challenged by recent research, and the Late Moche Period is distinguished by its dynamism and diversity. Sociopolitical transformations in Jequetepeque during the Late Moche Period, including the adoption of Wari material culture at San José Moro and the revival of Moche religious ritual in the region, must be understood in terms of the varied interactions of Moche communities with highland polities including Wari and Cajamarca.

While earlier migrationist/diffusionist approaches discredited the study of such contacts, the existence of object types, materials and technologies of ultimately distant origin is undeniable. We need to assess these within a new theoretical framework in order to understand their significance in the processes of social change.

Nodules protruding from the floor of the cave have been removed and modified. The paucity of performs and absence of finished flakedstone artifacts suggests that chert was removed from the cave and shaped into finished tools and weapons elsewhere. Artifacts manufactured from Wind Cave chert have been recovered from the midden deposits of nearby rockshelters, including Cliff Palace Cave.

Before we can truly understand the "international" maritime relations that are deemed characteristic of the period, we need more comprehensive investigations of local and regional nodes, in order to reveal how they were articulated with and nested within larger systems.

The survey was conducted from 2005 to 2008 and included sampling, investigation of site size and composition, impact of erosion, and public outreach. By integrating faunal and paleoenvironmental data with dating results, we present hypotheses regarding the development of a more sedentary lifeway during the late Holocene. We also discuss similarities and differences between settlement patterns proposed for the San Juan Islands with those proposed for adjacent regions. Taylor, Amanda [232] see Marty, Johanna V.

Finding and exploring campsites used by both the military and Apache will allow us to better understand the interaction between the two groups. This preliminary model, created using geographic and archival data, traits of a few known campsites, and ESRI GIS software, predicts where these military and Apache groups may have camped.

Thoughts about the most strategic sites on Catalina Island have been focused on the many protected coves that ring the island. The vast interior is little mentioned more than as lithic production sites. However, we have started to see that the coves have environmental, access, and view shed limitations that mesa tops don't. This isn't to doubt the importance of cove villages, but to add that villages on Catalina are more diverse and strategic than given credit. The goal of the paper is to discuss patterns that are emerging over three seasons of field work on the southern California Channel Island.

The particular varieties of rocks of the serpentinite mélange of this region (such as jadetite, omphacite, eclogite, etc) were precious goods that tied distant neighbors. Taking into consideration geochemical results of materials obtained from primary contexts and samples obtained from quarries, we could have a better understanding of the political economy of this network.

One example summarizes an SNA study of material culture collections from the Sepik coast of New Guinea previous analyzed using other methods confirming that material culture and language do not significantly covary there.

City of Mayapan, Yucatan Recent analyses of the spatial organization of Postclassic Mayapan have drawn attention to a possible marketplace. In Square K, a large rectangular plaza contains few domestic structures and could have accommodated large numbers of people or market activities. Soil research and detailed mapping have identified activity areas in the Square K plaza, which is currently in high ground cover. We used geochemical analyses to determine concentrations of phosphorus and heavy metals at this locality. These data may help identify market stalls and walkways and could give added support to the hypothesis that this area functioned as the city`s principal marketplace.

Thacker, Paul (Wake Forest University) [205] Local Stone Resource Availability and the Evolution of Middle and Upper Paleolithic Raw Material Economies A series of Middle and Upper Paleolithic archaeological sites located near high quality raw material sources in central Portugal document major qualitative changes in prehistoric lithic economies. Comprehensive geological study of gravel deposits rich in chert, quartz, and quartzite contextualizes the local resource background for ecological resource use modeling at each site. Artifact assemblage variation across raw material types indicates that Late Middle Paleolithic populations were organized around local resource exploitation with little long distance raw material transport. In contrast, Upper Paleolithic groups employed more diverse reduction strategies with variation specific to different raw materials and tool types.

Such an integration of architectural material culture data and the historical record could further scholarship on subjects such as how French colonists in North America used vernacular architecture to create and maintain cultural identity, and how this architecture carried with it indicators of wealth, status, and cultural interaction.

For the Late Prehistoric period, the "Guale problem" has highlighted contrasting views of residential and logistic mobility for these coastal people. This paper discusses sampling and inferential problems raised in linking seasonality studies to our understanding of mobility patterns and paleoclimatic change.

The local landscape features alluvial terraces incised by outsized meanders. The base of the T-1 at Coffee Bluff has been dated to greater than 30,000 years BP with two separate radiocarbon ages. Overlying alluvial strata register shifts from meandering to braided and then back to the current meandering channel pattern. Set back over a kilometer from the present river channel on a slightly higher T-2 terrace, the Glass site (9Tf145) was the location of a small village. An oxbow immediately adjacent to 9Tf145 was an active channel at the time that the site was visited by Spaniards and possibly as late as a 19th century historic map showing the Ocmulgee River floodplain.

LA 162, Bernalillo County, New Mexico The analysis of materials recovered from the seventeenth century metallurgical workshop at LA 162 has provided an archaeological perspective on the development of mining technology in frontier contexts of the Spanish Empire. Native American involvement in the practices represented at the workshop was initiated through Spanish colonial miners' interests in minerals used in indigenous technologies such as pigment and glaze production. This paper combines compositional and copper and lead isotope analysis from ore and sheet copper recovered from the workshop to explore how both local and regional resources were incorporated within the synchretic metallurgical technology at LA 162.

Archaeologists understand the value of extant collections and often encourage students not to dig new sites. However, as most PhD hopefuls realize, this is not sexy archaeology--utilizing collections will not get the grants that pay for research, nor will it bring much in way of prestige. To add to the paradox, many students find it difficult to gain access to museum collections, where money, time and resources are dwindling.

Bonito, Chaco Canyon Performance-based approaches to the mortuary record emphasize that burial practices are a social display. In some cases, the performance does not memorialize the social identity of the deceased, but instead creates a powerful display that transforms the identity of the dead. This paper argues that the elaborate burials placed in the oldest section of Pueblo Bonito, Chaco Canyon were part of a performance that was actively remembered. It examines the arrangement of human remains and objects in the burials and the sequence of deposition in the burial rooms to demonstrate that the deposits fostered continued relations between the living and dead.

Deposition of phytoliths in maize cob chaff is largely controlled by the regulatory locus TGA1, interacting with other genes during the growth of the maize cob. Assemblages of maize cob phytoliths illustrate that this deposition is influenced by more factors than glume hardness. Processing of maize for food often requires removal of the kernels from the cob, and some bits of chaff are included in this process. One method of increasing the capability of unglazed ceramics to hold water was the deliberate baking of food residues onto the interior walls of the vessels. Examples from three sites in Ecuador illustrate the utility of phytoliths recovered from food residues.

We recognize, as with any technique, that not all questions can be addressed by shallow geophysics. That said, we suggest one research agenda, the investigation of persistent places which is rooted in anthropological inquiry, that can be investigated, at least in part, by these techniques. In order to illustrate our points, we provide two examples from Mexico and the United States where the use of geophysics contributes to our understanding of changes in the use of space and architecture through time.

Texas and vicinity was well settled by Clovis times but millennia would pass before cook-stone technology became established some 8-9,000 years ago. Hot-rock cooking features increased in density and morphological diversity thereafter, indicating significant land-use intensification. Charred geophytes and other food plants, recovered from the oldest through youngest cook-stone features, argue for punctuated, directional dietary changes --carbohydrate revolutions. Increased consumption of readily masticated, often starchy plant foods, coupled with decreased intake of comparatively tough meats, affords pathways toward changes in cranial morphology, facilitated by smaller teeth, as argued by C. L. Brace, and, possibly by better developed amylase glands.

This paper based on a comprehensive survey of Classic Maya place names considers a very different picture: a landscape of several social entities which crossed political boundaries. Membership in these groups was not affected by changes in one`s political networks. Quite the opposite, it was one of the factors which determined one`s political networks. This observation has important implications for future archaeological and epigraphical studies of ancient Maya polities.

All three components utilized corn, beans and squash supplemented by locally available wild plant foods. Faunal exploitation focused on white-tailed deer and aquatic resources. A strong preference for local exploitation of woodland and aquatic environments is evident, with seasonal use of prairie resources. Variation in subsistence behavior over time is subtle and may reflect differences in duration of occupation, site function and/or anthropogenic landscape change. Tomasic, John and Tricia Waggoner (Kansas Historical Society) [73] Reexamining Spindle Whorls in the North American and Mesoamerican Archaeological Records Spindle whorls are tools used in spinning - the process of transforming raw fiber into twisted thread. Ethnohistoric evidence suggests spinning and weaving were household activities performed by women in domestic contexts in North America and Mesoamerica. In this poster, we reexamine the original interpretations of a series of artifacts from North American and Mesoamerican archaeological sites, and we suggest that these previous interpretations have overlooked their potential function as spinning tools used by women in domestic contexts. Furthermore, we argue that previous interpretations have not been particularly sensitive to evidence of female domestic activities in the archaeological record. Tomaskova, Silvia (UNC Chapel Hill) [104] Archaeological Magic The thesis that rock art may derive from shamanistic rituals achieved popularity in the 1990`s and remains attractive to lay as well as scholarly audiences. The interpretation has also met critical voices from archeologists who object to the absence of local historical accounts and the reductionism of such models. My research on the incorporation of Siberian shamans into archaeological narratives shows that our image of the shaman is a composite of changing disciplinary history, colonial narratives and past practice. Efforts to imagine universal roots for art, religion, and science in prehistoric magic have erased or overwritten gender. When seeking to study questions of art, religion and magic archaeologists should pay attention to history of their own field and the history of the region in question.

It was a focus of conflict through the Late Intermediate Period (AD1000-AD1470). Partially due to its strategic location on the continental divide, its occupants may have been forcibly removed by the Inka Empire in approximately AD 1465.

The evidence for Initial Coalescent warfare and defense is reviewed, mainly utilizing data from the Whistling Elk and Crow Creek village sites, and the overall pattern of conflict is examined from the perspective of frontiers and boundaries. It is concluded that intertribal warfare between Initial Coalescent invaders and resident Middle Missouri groups best explains this example of late prehistoric American Indian militarism.

Position seems to be a critical component of Andean recording systems. In other systems, attributes, symbols, or tokens may well have more importance. In the Andes, position not only demarcates the decimal values of the quipu (as indeed is also the case with Arabic numerals), but it also establishes the categories used in the Chimu accounting system, the values used in the Andean abacus, it structures Inca and Chimu storage space, and perhaps is reflected in more esoteric ways in concepts such as pacha, chaupi, tinku, yanantin, etc. [18] Discussant Topic, John [67] see Topic, Theresa Topic, Theresa (Brescia University College) and John Topic (Trent University) [67] Spondylus Use in the North Sierra of Peru This paper reviews reports of Spondylus from the Huamachuco, Cajamarca and Callejon areas, comparing the temporal and contextual information from these relatively well studied areas.

Osteological and isotopic analyses suggest a strong coastal tie consistent with archaeological evidence. Torres-Rouff, Christina [122] First Organizer Torvinen, Andrea (Arizona State University) [57] Multi-Scalar Analysis of Ceramic Exchange at a Regional Center in Northwest Mexico La Quemada, Zacatecas, was part of a regional network of centers known to have interacted through ceramic exchange during the Epiclassic period (A.D. 600-900). This study utilizes a clustering method to determine if different sectors of the site interacted differently with distant areas and whether the connections maintained by social constituencies residing in these sectors matched those observed at the site-wide level. Evidence for the repetition of differential use patterns regarding public vs. private space was found at multiple scales and supports the conclusion that La Quemada may have served as a ceremonial center for the Malpaso Valley and beyond.

The native aeronautic engineers designed bird effigy mounds as flyable symbols of their religious beliefs. Not only do the scale models of these bird effigies fly, but the native landscape architects placement of these mounds both reflect the local prevailing winds and the flight path of the represented bird above.

Ceramics from a 1939 excavation were reexamined to collect data on vessel form which may shed light on the culinary practices and ethnic identity of the site`s inhabitants. Future research will include the re-examination of Dismal River ceramics from the central-northern plains region, sourcing studies, and a more in-depth look at regional interactions between people in the Southwest and those living on the Plains. Trader, Patrick (Gray & Pape, Inc.) [150] Living on the Edge: Examining a Late Woodland Frontier Settlement in West-Central Illinois Data recovery efforts at Site 11ST547, were undertaken to mitigate adverse affects from the REX-East pipeline. Site 11ST547 is located in an upland interior interfluve summit. Thirteen radiocarbon assays were recovered from nine features dating from 1280 to 1080 B.P., suggesting a Late Woodland occupation. Ceramic analysis suggests they share traits with several ceramic traditions, including Bauer Branch, Maple Mills, and Adams variant. Site 11ST547 falls within a boundary zone and represents a nexus between several cultural traditions. This paper examines Site 11ST547 within the chronological and settlement patterns for the Late Woodland period in west-central Illinois. Trampier, Joshua (University of Chicago) [92] From Holes in the Ground to Lines in the Sand: Landscape Archaeology in Light of Bureaucratic and Academic Dimensions of Egyptian Cultural Heritage For two centuries, Egyptology and the Egyptian heritage management framework have developed in tandem, entrenching a vision of site based on monuments and the recovery of antiquities (athar). Artifacts and land have been artificially segregated and mapped based on overlapping bureaucratic and academic priorities and processes. This conceptualization has directly impacted research in the country, leaving much of the Nile floodplain unexplored. Addressing this legacy with a case study in the western Delta, this work emphasizes a broader behavioral definition of site grounded in dynamic human-environmental interactions, integrating analyses of ceramic density, remote sensing observations, and subsurface lithology. Tratebas, Alice (Bureau of Land Management) [111] Survey and Mapping of Little Missouri Antelope Trap After six field seasons of survey and mapping on the Little Missouri Antelope Trap in northeastern Wyoming, we have not yet identified the full extent of the trapping complex. Initially we mapped the most obvious structures, a pit trap and a corral. More recently we began tracing juniper drive wings along the margins of old growth junipers which border open valleys that were used to move antelope over passes into traps on the opposite slope. Some drive structures have multiple parallel wings that indicate repeat drives using the same drive strategy. Habitation remains directly associated with the juniper trap structures span Middle Archaic through Late Prehistoric.

La Milpa, Belize This paper is aimed at providing an overview of data collected from preliminary research carried out during the 2009 field season at the site of La Milpa in northwest Belize. Excavations have focused on monumental architecture in Plaza A, the largest plaza at the site, more specifically Structure 3. This research is part of a long-term project geared towards an analysis of the socio-political factors entailed in the conceptualization, undertaking and subsequent use of large-scale architectural projects, as well as an examination of possible differential elite sponsorship of monumental structures in the Maya area. Tremayne, Andrew (University of Wyoming) [79] An Analysis of Faunal Remains from a Denbigh Flint Complex Camp at Matcharak Lake (AMR-186), Alaska Excavation of a 4000 year old Denbigh Flint Complex camp at Matcharak Lake, located in Gates of the Arctic National Park, Alaska, uncovered preserved organic remains including some exceedingly rare bone and antler tools. Six bone points or prongs, cut antler, and one decorated fore-shaft support hypotheses of a heavy reliance on organic technology. Remains of caribou, Dall sheep, small mammals, birds and fish show they exploited a wide variety of species, suggesting a broad based diet, and an intimate familiarity with their environment. Juvenile caribou bones indicate at least one occupation occurred in late summer or early fall. Tribbett, Alysha (Vanderbilt University) and Tiffiny Tung (Vanderbilt University) [137] Corn and Coca in the post-Wari Era: Dental Health, Diet, and Subsistence Practices after State Collapse in the Highland Andes After the collapse of the Wari state, sectors of the urban capital -- Huari--were occupied well into the Late Intermediate Period (1000 ­ 1400 CE). Did later occupants continue to use nearby agricultural lands to maintain Wari-era food production and consumption patterns? Were maize and coca commonly ingested? To address these questions, we examined the dental health of 85 adults and 19 juveniles. Results show that slightly more than half experienced antemortem tooth loss and a third suffered from at least one dental abscess or carious lesion, suggesting a continuation of agricultural practices. CEJ caries suggest some may have consumed coca. Trigg, Heather (Univ Massachusetts Boston) [193] Politics, Trade, and 19th-century Vecino Identity: An Archaeological Examination of a Small New Mexican Ranch The 19th century represented a time of political upheaval for New Mexico. First as part of the Spanish Empire, then the Mexican State, and finally as a territory of the United States, New Mexico experienced changes in economic and social relationships with shifting centers of political control. Increased social and economic contacts with Anglo-Americans accompanied the opening of the Santa Fe Trail and incorporation into the United States. These economic, social, and political relationships influenced vecino identity and how it was expressed in material goods and practices. This paper explores these relationships at one vecino site in northern New Mexico.

City Archaeologist) and Shagun Raina (University of Wisconsin, Madison) [163] GIS and Archaeological Data Management in the Nation`s Capitol Conversion from paper-based archaeological data management to a GIS has streamlined review and compliance in the DC SHPO, providing sophisticated land-use analysis in place of gut instinct. Standard and custom layers inform recommendations for survey type, location, and depth. A 17-acre parcel considered too disturbed to warrant testing in 1990 was reviewed using GIS and three acres with high potential were identified An eligible Late Woodland campsite with a lithic quarry/ workshop was located during testing. Data layers with historic shoreline and stream course reconstructions, former cemetery locations, and Late Pleistocene paleosols are used to target specific types of resources. Trombold, Charles (Washington University in St. Louis) [13] Recent Excavations on the La Quemada Agricultural Terraces, Zacatecas, Mexico Based on pollen and phytolith profiles from our first test excavations on the terraces in 2000, it appeared that the terraces were possibly a late response to climatic deterioration. The extended excavations in 2008 and 2009, however, unequivocally demonstrate their earlier construction during the La Quemada phase (ca. AD 600 ­ 800) at the time of greatest population growth and political centralization. The uniform construction style of terraces and the contiguous 12 meter wide causeway indicate centralized labor coordination and contemporaneity. This paper discusses aspects of terrace and causeway architecture, associated artifacts, labor investment and an associated village site (La Jabonera). Trombold, Charles D.

AD 500 to sometime in the first millennium BC. These discoveries suggest that intensive farming in the region first took hold in well-watered highland settings, while more mobile hunting and gathering persisted as the dominant pattern in the lowlands until later Formative times. These findings challenge at least one model of subsistence-settlement patterns previously proposed for the region, and suggest a complex integration of upland and lowland economic systems in the region.

Ullah, Isaac (Arizona State University, SHESC) [73] Assessing the Accuracy of Microrefuse Sampling Techniques Spatial analyses of microrefuse recovered from ancient living surfaces can reveal the location and character of activities that occurred on those surfaces. How microrefuse samples are taken, however, greatly influences the outcome of these spatial analyses. This paper advocates a new strategy of collecting many small microrefuse samples from the nodes of a triangular lattice as opposed to several commonly used microrefuse sampling techniques, including grid-based, purposive bulk, and random bulk sampling. Each strategy is tested and ranked according to how accurately it can predict the real spatial variation present in several sample microrefuse scatters simulated in a GIS. [184] see Bergin, Sean M.

In this presentation, I discuss tests of the hypothesis that variation in the finishing of lip forms may be one way to see specialized ceramic production. Fundamental is the idea that lip finishing is a product of habitus, that is, once learned, it is largely unconscious. In an earlier test of this proposition, contrary to my expectations, finishing was more variable in areas where production was concentrated, and fairly uniform at sites where production was small-scale and/or intermittent. This result will be further tested in other situations of neighboring small- and larger-scale manufacturing.

major role in the early iron industry of colonial New England. The magmatic titaniferous ore is believed to have been exploited as a natural resource in the 18th century by industrious colonists, including the Brown brothers, namesakes of Brown University. Because cumberlandite is much denser than the granites and metamorphic rocks common to Rhode Island, it creates a detectable gravity anomaly.

Urquhart, Gerald [4] see Lovis, William Urton, Gary (Harvard University) [96] The Paradigm of the Knotted String as a Model for the Structure and Organization of Storage Facilities in the Inka Empire To date, we have a wealth of studies, both archaeological and ethnohistorical, of Inka storage facilities, as well as an equally extensive collection of works dealing with the Inka knotted-string recording device, the khipu (or quipu; Quechua: "knot"). While we know that the khipu was used to record information on the contents and disposition of the storehouses located in state administrative centers, we have not to date developed a comprehensive theory that would allow us to articulate the nature of the connection between the structural characteristics and account recording principles of the khipu, on one hand, and the structural and organizational features of Inka storage facilities, on the other.

Although goblets and drinking vessels dominate the assemblages, the specific shapes vary widely, reflecting the individualized exchange relations that characterized this period. We suggest that Teotihuacan's selection of this ceramic type as a major component of its long distance commercial networks resulted in the standardized morphology and paste found during Classic times.

These areas, separated by approximately one hundred meters, were occupied roughly from AD 600 to 1100. Though their architectural remains differ markedly, these areas are strikingly similar in their ubiquity of garbage pits. A detailed analysis of the faunal data from each pit aided with data from ceramics and paleoethnobotany allows a discussion of residential life, burial practices and garbage disposal in Tiwanaku. Van Buren, Mary (Colorado State University) and Claire Cohen [255] Technological Diversity and Stagnation: The Political Economy of Small-scale Silver Production in the Southern Andes Spanish mine owners relied on indigenous technology for the production of silver in the southern Andes immediately following the conquest, but declining ore quality resulted in the introduction of mercury amalgamation in the 1570s. This technology required large amounts of capital and was thus controlled by Europeans who dominated the industry for the next two centuries. However, the archaeological record at Porco, a mining center in southern Bolivia, indicates that this period was characterized by a diverse array of techniques used to produce silver, rather than the disappearance of small scale production. This paper examines the conditions that fostered technological diversity in Porco and the processes that led to its eventual decline.

In this talk we compare pre- and post-contact zooarchaeological remains from sites in the Los Angeles basin. The introduction of foreign foods and technologies coincided with changes in animal processing and procurement for both native and introduced species. Aboriginal fishing yields increased whereas large mammal yields decreased, despite the introduction of domesticates. Additionally, the condition of many post-contact specimens suggests that mammal remains were not as intensively processed as earlier. This evidence provides insights into the adjustment of the area`s Native populations to Hispanic colonization.

VanderVeen, James (IU South Bend) [97] Evaluating Classic Taíno Culture History: An Interesting Intersection of Carbon Dating, Cholesterol, and Ceramics Archaeologists traditionally use decorated ceramics as indicators of cultural differences. The conventional wisdom regarding the pottery made by the Taínos of the Caribbean hints at a distinct, linear timeframe and exclusive ethnic influences in their designs. But recent excavations in the Dominican Republic are challenging this assumption with evidence of two separate decoration styles present in the same sites, at the same time, and with the same food content. The spatial, temporal, and functional distribution of recovered pottery sherds is more homogeneous than expected, suggesting that the diverse forms of surface ornamentation may potentially reflect small scale social distinctions.

Important places for the animation of beings were associated with water, as mostly clearly discerned with the reservoirs, Walk-in-Well, canals, and the site's placement and layout. We discuss the various cases of ritual dedication and closure at Paquimé, and describe their social importance. Ultimately we proposed that the inalienable objects used in ritual dedication and closure keep water animated, helping make Paquimé the center place of the Casas Grandes World.

Recent studies of projectile point types in the Pacific Northwest suggest that type variability and distribution are more complex than previously thought. The comparative analysis of projectile points from the Duwamish (45KI23) and Marymoor (45KI9/A - 45KI9/B) sites with other sites in the region suggest that although a high rate of variability in the morphological attributes of these points exists, this variability does not signify new point types, but rather, an expansion of the influence of existing styles. This paper outlines the continuing analysis of Pacific Northwest point types and raw material variation.

Stratigraphic samples representing most of the Holocene and accumulated from several sites within the project area combine to create a record of early Holocene forests and middle Holocene (Archaic) thinning of the forests. Changing composition of the forest from Early to Middle Holocene, as well as changing frequencies of persistent members of the vegetation community provide an indication of the context in which people lived. Human activity appears to have created a cultural landscape that included more nut trees and open areas.

In spite of the relative scarcity of data and lack of detailed paleoenvironmental reconstructions for the time span under consideration, we could argue about the continued dense human population at all main drainage areas in Southern Siberia. The Final Paleolithic saw the important changes in subsistence activities manifested by the diversification of hunting practices and increase in specialized reindeer procurement, especially in the Yenisey valley. At the same time the huge area around the Lake Baikal witnessed the increase in fishing and the dispersal of harpoons and fishhooks. Vasquez, Javier [87] see Condon, Peter C. Vaughan, David [255] Slavery, Mining and Interaction in Colonial New Mexico The debate over whether Spanish miners compelled Pueblo Indians to work in New Mexico's silver mines is reexamined through comparisons of the written and archaeological records of mining interaction during the early colonial period. The results reveal previously unseen aspects of the story of colonial mining on New Spain's northernmost frontier, as well as clear changes in the nature of mining interactions over time. Further insight is gained suggesting a relationship between these changes in interaction, technological syncretism, and the development of a new, multi-ethnic mining tradition in New Mexico.

The analysis was conducted for two principal reasons: (1) to add chronological depth to a growing database of compositional data of Nasca ceramics, especially by including samples from Middle Nasca through the Middle Horizon; and (2) to test the efficacy of LA-ICP-MS when compared to INAA. The results have implications for our understanding of changes in Nasca political economy over time and also demonstrate that LA-ICP-MS is an effective alternative to INAA when considering compositional techniques. Veerawan, Sutee (University of Arizona) [121] Technological Variation of the Production of Glazes on Khmer

Ceramics from Ban Kruat, Thailand Khmer stoneware was made by groups of potters in Cambodia and northeastern Thailand between the 9th and 14th centuries CE. Scholars have previously recognized important variations in pastes, glazes, and forming techniques among different stoneware types. The research presented in this poster use LA-ICP-MS to examine differences in the production of glazes on Khmer stoneware from 13 kiln sites located in Ban Kuart area, northeastern Thailand. The analysis reveals that chemical compositions vary markedly within and between glaze groups. Reasons for these variations will be considered, and the implications for understanding technology and production organization will be explored. Vehik, Susan (University of Oklahoma) [220] Conflict and Fortification on the Southern Plains Indicators of violence among Plains peoples increases steadily after AD 700. However, the use of fortification to protect against rising violence develops much later on the southern Plains compared to more northern areas. This study concludes that southern Plains peoples first use aggregation rather than fortification as a defense mechanism. After AD 1450, lifestyle changes and epidemic disease bring about the use of fortification on the southern Plains.

The shells had to be dived in the sea and transported to the inland sites, where the objects were made using different techniques. Its importance resided in the symbolism conferred to them by the cultures of both areas. In the present paper a comparison between Mesoamerica and the Andean Region is presented, in relation to the use, production and meaning of Spondylus princeps and other related species.

While the particular timeline of their introduction varies somewhat throughout the Gulf lowlands, it is generally agreed that they are characteristic of late prehistory and have their likely antecedents in highland Mesoamerica. In this paper, I discuss the comal assemblage at Totogal, a Postclassic center in the western Tuxtla Mountains, and evaluate the possible mechanisms that resulted in their rapid implementation in the region.

The tendency to downplay the Early Woodland as nothing more than "Archaic with pottery" ignores increasing evidence for environmental change and population migrations during this period, indicating a highly dynamic context for the development of Middle Woodland Hopewell culture. This paper examines existing Early Woodland archaeological and environmental datasets from the Lower Illinois Valley to assess evidence for increasing landscape instability and population movement.

In that sense, landscape is something alive and dynamic, which, as social agent, structure the human action and is structured by it. Here I will adopt a relational perspective where the shared experience of dwelling is basic to understanding the process of incorporating the landscape. In this presentation, I will analyze the notion of landscape from the agency theory and identities negotiation perspectives in hunter, fisher and gatherers societies (central coast of Sonora, México), through the rock art study.

Villamil, Laura (University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee) [225] Lowland Maya Post-Collapse Communities in south-central Quintana Roo, Mexico This paper examines the widespread reoccupation of abandoned Classic Maya sites in south-central Quintana Roo, Mexico, and explores the ways in which memories and vestiges of the past shaped social activity in the wake of the so-called Maya Collapse. I discuss how post-collapse communities formed by appropriating and transforming the built environment while at the same time rejecting the old spatial order. For populations displaced by the socio-political upheaval of the time, abandoned sites served as fertile ground in which new social strategies--including novel experiments at community organization--were adopted. Vining, Benjamin (Boston University) [85] Assessing the Complexity of Built Archaeological Environments: A Multi-data Geophysical Approach The refinement of geophysical applications enables detailed resolution of internal site structuring, allowing archaeological inferences on the behavioral aspects contributing to site formation. Magnetometer and site-scale digital elevation data from four sitesKota-Rentang, Indonesia; Mersa Gawasis, Egypt; Witz-Cah-Akal, Belize; and Kaymaçki, Turkey-characterize the sites' degree of organization and spatial variance. These data reveal variable site formation behaviors, ranging from the growth of ephemeral features through repeated use and accumulation, to the planning and construction of organized monumental sites. Such indices of spatial organization derived from remotely-sensed datasets ultimately describe the social mechanics that differentiate aggregated versus built archaeological environments. Vint, James (Desert Archaeology, Inc.) [44] Persistence of the Las Capas Canal System, 950 B.C.-800 B.C. Recent excavations at the site of Las Capas in the Tucson Basin revealed extensive canal-irrigated fields that date from about 1250 B.C. to 800 B.C. The stratigraphic record documents superimposed canals and fields that remained consistent in layout from about 950 B.C. to 800 B.C, within floodplain deposits over a meter thick. Clusters of field houses likely represent households or smallholders who owned fields and were responsible for maintenance of canal segments within the overall system. The persistence of the system, and associated field house infrastructure, are testament to a welldeveloped, dedicated investment in farmland and early sedentary village life.

Intrusive Burials, Looting, and Archaeological Investigations at El Purgatorio, Peru The archaeology of intrusiveness inevitably raises the question of subjectivity. Who is the intruder and according to whose perspective? Burials considered intrusive by modern archaeological standards may have been considered common practice from the perspective of the ancient people who interred them. Looting activities deemed destructive by archaeologists may be perceived as inconsequential or even a cultural norm by local communities. In fact, these same communities may consider archaeological projects to be intrusive into their daily lives and priorities. To illustrate, this paper will present evidence of intrusiveness at the site of El Purgatorio in the Casma Valley of Peru. Volf, William (NRCS) [249] Pastures and Pitstructures: Applying Geophysical Techniques in a CRM Setting Southwestern Colorado is well known for its Ancestral Puebloan archeological resources that can often be identified, mapped, and evaluated based on surface observations. When prehistoric cultural locations have been converted to modern agricultural fields, the surface expression of the sites is often eliminated, limiting the information that can be gleaned from surface observations. A noninvasive manner to investigate these sites is through the use of geophysical instruments. This paper will discuss the application of geophysical techniques at archeological sites found in agricultural fields in Southwestern Colorado. von Cramon-Taubadel, Noreen (University of Kent, Canterbury) and Ron Pinhasi (University College Cork) [82] Craniometric Data Supports Demic Diffusion Model for the Spread of Agriculture into Europe The question of whether agriculture spread into Europe primarily as a result of human migration (demic diffusion) or the diffusion of culture has been heavily debated. It has been shown that human craniometric variation is a reliable proxy for neutral genetic data. Therefore, we employ a large Mesolithic and Neolithic craniometric database to test alternative population dispersal scenarios based on a null evolutionary model of isolation-by-geographic and temporal distance. Partial Mantel test comparisons of craniometric distance

and each alternative scenario demonstrate that the craniometric data fit a model of demic diffusion significantly better than a model of cultural diffusion. Vonarx, Amy Jo (University of Arizona) [110] Cycles and Events: Methodological and Interpretive Tools for Placing Fires in Time Sites with significant burning present the researcher with great methodological opportunities and interpretive challenges. One important arena of discussion: the possibilities for dating architectural fire events through relative and chronometric means. Recent work in early aggregated villages around the world highlights the potential for using microstratigraphy, micromorphology, archaeomagnetic and radiocarbon dating techniques to place fires in time. These studies emphasize that village landscapes display complex fire histories composed of cycles of practice and events. As such, architecture and locales should not be assumed to have burned contemporaneously, or only once, prior to analysis.

Walker, William (New Mexico State University) [192] A History of Practice in New Mexico`s Borderlands This paper presents a practice based synthesis of the changing cultural landscape of southwest New Mexico`s late prehistoric (A.D. 1000-1450) borderlands. This region was characterized by three periods and associated phases: early (A.D. 1000-1130); middle (1130-1300) and late (A.D.1300-1450). Practice theory suggests that these periods track how artifact histories were shaped by emergent properties of changing systems of practices. This paper examines those practices and properties in order to understand the relationship among Mimbres people and others between the 11th and 15th centuries. Crucial themes in these relationships include climate changes, artifact agency, and rise of new religious movements. [128] Discussant Walker, William H.

Modern references of domestic and wild species are examined for comparison to archaeological seed remains from multiple cultural stages. Magnified seed images will help taxonomical identification of millet species (demonstrating features used for identification), and statistical tests on morphological data may reveal population trends in the domestication process.

Archival research indicates the fortification was constructed in 1864; however, Fort Sully was not called upon to defend Fort Leavenworth. The fortification was subsequently abandoned and has remained essentially undisturbed since 1865.

While excavation data suggest that the region was directly dominated by the Wari Empire during this period, it appears that the people of Cajamarca managed to maintain their own cultural traditions while engaging with Wari and other outside groups. Waterman, Anna (University of Iowa) and Robert, H. Tykot (University of South Florida) [184] Evidence of Dietary Variability and Breadth at Los Millares (Almería, Spain) (c. 2700-1900 BC) Based on Stable Isotope Analysis of Human Remains The archaeological record for the Spanish Chalcolithic settlement site of Los Millares provides evidence of increasing political centralization and social stratification during the 3rd millennia BC. One special feature of Los Millares is its expansive cemetery complex from which human remains of numerous individuals have been recovered. This poster details the results of stable isotope analysis of human bone from 12 individuals recovered from tombs in the Los Millares cemetery. The goal of this study is to evaluate the dietary importance of aquatic resources and domesticated animals during this time of societal transition. Directions for further study are discussed.

Archaeological evidence is present in channel margin and floodplain deposits. Multiple proxy data sets from the well-dated floodplain deposits contain evidence of the Younger Dryas. These data agree with the regional evidence for the Younger Dryas in Central Texas. Archaeological evidence from the Younger Dryas age deposits at Buttermilk Creek show no change in the intensity of occupation at the site. [120] see Keene, Joshua L.

Watkins, Christopher (Arizona State University) and Sophia Kelly (Arizona State University) [100] Exchange Spheres and Social Boundaries in the Central Arizona Uplands: An Evaluation of the Verde Confederacy Model using Plain Ware Provenance Data The recently proposed Verde Confederacy model argues that 14th century settlements in central Arizona were part of a defensive alliance marked by persistent connectivity across the region. This paper evaluates the model with ceramic exchange data. Temper and clay characterization of plain ware pottery identified distinct compositional differences in pottery produced at different settlements, and allow us to track the movement of pots between villages. Preliminary data indicate the presence of two exchange spheres focused on Perry Mesa and settlements in the Verde River valley. These patterns hint at social boundaries among groups instead of a single, coordinated alliance. Watkins, Joe (University of Oklahoma) [7] Naturalizing` the Native, Appropriating the Ancestors: Kennewick and an Unintended Impact of Repatriation While the American military thought its way was the best means of handling the Indian problem, and the American government felt legislating Indians out of existence would work, perhaps American archaeologists have a better idea. The ex post facto imposition of American on the earliest inhabitants of this continent has created the widespread idea that these first cultures are totally unrelated to Indigenous ones. This creates a bizarre version of cultural affiliation between the Paleopeople and the archaeologists who study them. This unintended impact of repatriation can become a potent means of disenfranchising Native cultures from their deep past. [63] Discussant [63] Second Chair Watson, Adam (University of Virginia) [64] Ritual, Cuisine, and Commensal Politics at Bc 57 and Bc 58, Chaco Canyon, NM The role of periodic pilgrimages and large-scale communal events figures prominently in several models of Chacoan sociopolitical dynamics. While these interpretations are partly based upon patterns of faunal procurement and consumption that may reflect commensal feasting in Great House settings, the possibility of similar practices in non-Great House contexts has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper presents the preliminary results of an analysis of the animal remains from two Chacoan small sites (Bc 57 and Bc 58) located in proximity to Casa Rinconada and explores the political implications of communal hunting, food preparation and distribution, and ritual use of fauna.

Watson, James (Arizona State Museum, University of Arizona) and Jessica Cerezo-Roman (University of Arizona) [158] The Performative Transition of Mortuary Ritual in the southern Southwest A major change in the performance of mortuary ritual occurred in the southern Southwest in the first millennium A.D. Early Agricultural burial programs entailed non-patterned inhumation burial, expressing individual identity based on age, sex and shared socio-religious cosmology. Hohokam burial programs entailed patterned distribution of secondary cremations, expressing of vertical and horizontal social position in addition to age, sex and shared group cosmology. We propose that the emergence of patterns in the performance of mortuary ritual among the Hohokam reflect changes in social

expression whereas the shift to cremation reflects changes in the beliefs surrounding the disposition of the soul. Watson, Patty [222] Discussant Wattenmaker, Patricia (University of Virginia) [64] Discussant Wauters, Valentine and Mafalda Martins (Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium) [98] Feasting for the Dead: Funerary Practices and Ancestor Veneration at Panquilma, Peruvian Central Coast In the Andes, since the first Spanish chronicles were recorded, one of the most prominent activities where ideology, economy and politics interacted in the configuration of social power is ancestor veneration rituals. This paper explores this relationship at the site of Panquilma. Panquilma is a Late Intermediate/ Late Horizon site located in the Peruvian central coast at less than a day`s walk from one of the most important religious centers of the Andean world: Pachacamac. Recent research at the site has focused on the relationship between the different types of funerary structures registered along the site and remains of feasting activities located in the elite domestic sector of this community. In this paper we will present evidence about how the performance of ancestor veneration rituals and feasting activities were central in the political competition for prestige and authority among elite factions at the site. Waweru, Veronica (National Museums of Kenya) [129] Aquatic-Based Economic Intensification During the Holocene at Lothagam, Turkana Kenya The Lothagam site in Turkana, Kenya has assemblages dominated by aquatic fauna, bone harpoons, ceramics, and lithic tools. Human remains are interred in cemeteries. The site`s contents suggest changes in hunter/gatherer socio-economic organization not present in contemporary grassland or Late Pleistocene societies. The revised chronology of the Lothagam site presented here provides new dates on the timing of intensive extraction of aquatic resources, possible sedentism, and the earliest use of ceramics by fisher/hunter/gatherers at Lothagam. The new dates also allow temporal comparisons with other Early Holocene sites in the Turkana basin, and in regions further west and north. Waweru, Veronica [53] see Hildebrand, Elisabeth Way, Annie (Washington University, St. Louis) [217] Mound Mad: New Insights into the Sociopolitics of Settlement in the Late Prehistoric Lower Yazoo Basin Settlement evidence indicates that along Deer Creek in the western Lower Yazoo much of the late prehistoric population would have lived in a series of mound sites rather than in dispersed smaller farmsteads. Most models of spatial and sociopolitical organization for late prehistoric societies in the southeast are based on less top-heavy settlement patterns. This paper, however, examines the sociopolitical and spatial relationships between sites with and without mounds in this area. The environmental settings of sites and their ceramic assemblages provide possible clues to local late prehistoric land use and sociopolitical organization.

The African-American experience in New England followed unique social and economic trajectories, and foodways provide an entrée into these experiences. Faunal data from the Higginbotham House in Nantucket, Massachusetts, a late 18th century African-American household, is compared with other Northeastern African-American sites to establish broad and site-specific patterns. While many New England sites emphasize beef, pork, and mutton as staples, idiosyncratic dietary elements illustrate the interplay between foodways and identity. Food

Weaver, Sarah (Ohio University), AnnCorinne Freter (Ohio University), Elliot Abrams (Ohio University) and Paul Patton (The Ohio State University) [30] Hopewell Sedentism and Food Production: A View from the Patton Site, Southeastern Ohio The settlement patterns, degree of sedentism, and subsistence strategies of Ohio Middle Woodland populations, heuristically termed Hopewell, have been greatly debated. The Patton site (33AT990), a Middle Woodland habitation located within the Hocking River Valley of Southeastern Ohio, provides evidence of a transition to sedentary food producing communities. Excavation uncovered a rectilinear wattle and daub house surrounded by domestic activity areas, evidence of burning and rebuilding, well preserved refuse and storage pits, macro-botanical data, and an artifact assemblage indicative of a continuous long-term, or sedentary, site occupation.

Of special interest are two divergent biotic regions, within which two different traditions (tanged point complex and curve-backed point complex) of Dryas III in Germany and Austria are found. Settlement discontinuity during Dryas III is questioned and the potential further existence of established social networks, expressed by comparable developments such as microlithization is considered. It is discussed whether Dryas III acted as an accelerator or a brake in the process of regional diversification of the Mesolithic. Webster, David (Penn State University) [153] A Chinese Traveler Among the Maya Zhou Daguan, a Chinese traveler, visited Angkor in 1296-97 and left us the only lengthy "historical" description of Khmer society.

What would strike him as very different? What might his observations imply about the parallel (or not) evolution of tropical forest civilizations? Webster, Laurie (University of Arizona) [37] Cordage Twist and Cultural Identity: A Cautionary Tale from Basketmaker Culture Several recent studies have used cordage-twist direction as a point of departure for exploring cultural identity in the archaeological record. Despite the strong contributions of this research, most studies fail to distinguish between cords used as ropes or ties and the yarns used in fabric construction. Using Basketmaker textiles as a case study, I compare the patterned variability in the twist direction of cordage and the warp and weft elements of sandals, aprons, tumplines, and twined bags to show that correlating twist direction with Basketmaker culture is not as simple as it seems. Weed, Carol (Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc.)

Its origins remain uncertain. Four data sets are analyzed to evaluate whether the Midewiwin originated historically or prehistorically, including 1) 15 early, colonial written documents, 2) 55

traditional, indigenous origin stories, 3) excavated artifacts and features from 12 archaeological sites, and 4) imagery from 388 rock paintings. Results indicate a general correspondence among the four bodies of evidence that something like the Midewiwin probably originated in remote antiquity. Wegener, Robert (Statistical Research, Inc.), Karry L. Blake (Statistical Research, Inc.), Richard Ciolek-Torrello (Statistical Research, Inc.) and William M. Graves (Statistical Research, Inc.) [33] Data Recovery at Christiansen Border Village: Nonriverine Late Archaic/Early Agricultural Period Archaeology and Mid- to LateHolocene Cienega Environments in the Borderlands of Southeastern Arizona Data recovery efforts by Statistical Research, Inc., at Christiansen Border Village documented 3,000 years of aboriginal land use and included a regional study of Mid- to Late-Holocene cienega environments throughout southeastern Arizona. This work expands our understanding of Late Archaic/Early Agricultural land use with evidence of maize cultivation at 980 ­800 cal B.C. and likely cultivation of cotton at 820­510 cal B.C. The Late Archaic/Early Agricultural remains at the site are interpreted as the result of a rich hunter-gatherer heritage that flourished during the rigors of the midHolocene and ultimately incorporated Mesoamerican domesticates in nonriverine Borderlands locales. Wehrberger, Kurt (Ulmer Museum) and Nicholas Conard (Universität Tübingen, Institut für Ur- und Frühgeschichte) [157] Lion Man and Waterbird - Art and Symbolism in the Swabian Aurignacian One of the main cultural elements of the Swabian Aurignacian is the appearance of sculptural art. About 45 figurines, mainly fragments, are known. The tiny sculptures were carved out of mammoth ivory and represent large animals such as horse, mammoth and feline. Others depict animals such as waterbird or fish. Unique is an archaic female figurine. Nearly all figurines exhibit incisions, often strung together forming complex patterns. A few figures represent fantastic creatures, which combine zoomorphic with anthropomorphic elements. Especially the lion man implies a spiritual aspect to the figurines.

[150] A Walk Through Time Across Illinois: An Overview of Phase I and Phase II Investigations Along the REX-East Pipeline Archaeological survey of a nearly 200 mile long corridor across central Illinois identified 483 archaeological sites. Test excavations were conducted at 63 of these sites. These investigations provided a wealth of information regarding prehistoric land use patterns through time across the state. This paper will provide an overview of these results particularly highlighting aspects of the Early Archaic, Middle Archaic and Late Woodland periods. The results of this linear survey have significant potential to shape current understandings of cultural sequences, land use patterns, and predictive modeling within Illinois and the greater midcontinental United States.

We conclude that Mangareva and the Pitcairn Group were settled before A.D. 1000, Rapa Nui about A.D. 1000, Hawaii about A.D. 800-900, and the Marquesas about A.D. 700-800. The earliest direct dates on sites will always be at the tail of any normal distribution illustrating a radiocarbon dating corpus for the overall colonization process, and not at its chronometric centroid. Weisler, Marshall [68] see Weisler, Marshall I. Weisman, Brent (University of South Florida) [170] Front Yard, Back Yard: Neighborhood Archaeology in Urban Tampa, Florida Doing archaeology right where people live brings immediacy to the processes of site interpretation and heritage making not usually present in more remote projects. When people can peer down into their buried history or the history of their neighborhood as they move about in the course of their daily lives, public archaeology suddenly becomes very personal. Memory and imagination blend together to create connections to a past that are both highly idiosyncratic and of the political present. Three projects in Tampa aimed at unearthing the forgotten history of the recent past will be examined as case studies. Welch, Daniel (Texas A&M University) and Daniel Welch (Texas A&M University) [161] Dispersal of Volcanic Glass Resources in Ceramic-Period Samoa: Resource Control and Long-Distance Trade Geochemical analyses of volcanic glass artifacts from the Samoan Archipelago suggest that ceramic period inhabitants acquired the raw material from a single, currently unknown source. In light of this understanding, additional highland and coastal sites across the archipelago are tested under EDXRF and support the consensus that raw volcanic glass originated from a single outcrop that provisioned ceramic making inhabitants for over 2000 years. To understand the organization of lithic resources during the ceramic period, theoretical models regarding potential archaeological correlates of ceramic period resource control as well as probable direction of resource dispersion are discussed.

Christian (University of South Florida) [123] Alkaline Earth Metals as Human Activity Markers in Archaeological Soils Soil phosphates have long been recognized to indicate past human activity in the archaeological record. Only with recent advancements in analytical instrumentation have archaeologists begun to consider other chemical elements. The significance of alkaline earth metals (especially Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) as markers of ancient human activity has been recognized recently, but very little research has been done to understand their interrelationships in chemical residues. Their

usefulness in archaeological soil chemistry has therefore been limited. This poster considers acid-extractable alkaline earth metals characterized with ICP-OES from a range of archaeological soil surfaces in Honduras to determine their relevance for interpreting ancient human activity patterns.

Wendt, Carl (Cal State University - Fullerton) and Jason De Leon (University of Washington) [156] The Political Economy of the San Lorenzo Polity: A View from the Countryside Long-distance monument transport, large scale public construction, and works of art are often cited as evidence that Olmec leaders wielded a great deal of political and economic power over local followers and often over large regions. Using data from excavations at the site of El Remolino in the San Lorenzo hinterlands, we argue that power in the San Lorenzo polity was largely confined to the ideological realm. Moreover, our analysis indicates that the San Lorenzo Olmec elite and leaders did not exhibit the degree of economic control over commoner households that elites in later state societies typically wielded.

It produced the well-preserved remains of 168 individuals, allowing a comprehensive look at life and health 7,000 years ago. This research examines medicinal plant usage among the people at Windover. Historical accounts and ethnographies provide details as to how aboriginal populations have utilized local flora for specific conditions. By correlating medicinal plants identified among the Windover burials with the pathologies identified on their remains, we may infer medicinal plant usage among this population during Florida`s Archaic.

Here we present a close-in view of household organization at a Franciscan doctrina in the Colca Valley, established between the 1540s and 1560s and abandoned during the 1570s. Drawing on extensive excavations from several domestic structures, we analyze variation in the organization of domestic space and differences in their artifact assemblages to infer how households of distinct status and identity responded and adapted to the convulsive changes around them.

The results strongly suggest that across parts of North America, Europe, and Asia, a major human population decline and reorganization occurred near 12.9 ka and continued through the early part of the YD. These changes include replacement of Clovis-age peoples by regional-scale cultures, potentially reflecting decreased range mobility and increased population isolation. West, G.

Whelan, Carly (UC Davis) [6] Prehistoric Subsistence-Settlement Patterns of the West-Central Sierra Nevada Foothills The Sierra Nevada was one of the last regions of California to experience systematic archaeological excavation and remains one of the most poorly understood, particularly the region`s western foothills. Though subsistence-settlement patterns have been of longstanding interest to archaeologists working in the area, few systematic studies of prehistoric subsistence change or diachronic change in land use

have been carried out. I have recently excavated several sites in the west-central Sierra Nevada foothills in order to clarify the prehistoric subsistence-settlement patterns of the region and determine how they have changed over the course of the last several thousand years. Whitaker, Adie (Far Western Anthropological Research Group, Inc.) and Jeffrey Rosenthal (Far Western Anthropological Research Group) [197] What Turned the Tide? Late Prehistoric Shifts to Energy Maximizing Economies in the Mountains and Rugged Coastline of California The record in California is replete with examples of sudden shifts in subsistence economy, particularly within the past 1500 years. The tacit assumption is that shifts from simple forager adaptations to highly intensified, energy-maximizing economies occurred similarly across the state. However, studies in the Great Central Valley, the San Francisco Bay Area, and along the Southern Coast document intensive subsistence economies going back several thousand years. Why, then, were other regions so slow to adopt intensified subsistence economies? We attempt to answer this question through an examination of the ecological and historical differences between "Early Intensifier" areas and "Late Intensifier" areas. [197] Second Chair White, Andrew (University of Michigan) [88] A Computational Exploration of the Effects of Network Size and Structure on the Outcomes of Cultural Transmission Processes Mathematical models of cultural transmission often assume that information transfer occurs within an unstructured, global pool of individuals. Human cultural systems, however, are comprised of individuals connected to one another through overlapping, ego-based networks of social connections. I use a simple computational model to (1) represent ego-based networks of varying size and structure and (2) explore how variation in a single stylistic variable is related to the attributes of the networks mediating the transmission of the variable. Results suggest that network properties may have important implications for understanding spatial and temporal patterns of archaeological artifact variability.

Motivated by third-wave feminism, we consider recent studies on cognitive and emotional difference and their implications for the emergence of modernity, including schizophrenia as the possible inspiration for ritual action; high-functioning autism and its implications for leadership; and affective diseases and their correlation with artistic creativity. These studies suggest that human cognitive and behavioral evolution involved more than our traditional Cartesian rationalist model has assumed. Whitley, David S. [104] see Whitley, David S.

The Native American values associated with Painted Rock have played a pivotal role in site management. The Carrizo Native American Advisory Committee has been a central element in planning and management, especially with regard to developing guidelines for cultural tourism at Painted Rock. Painted Rock provides an example of the kinds of Native American concerns and roles vital in the management of sacred sites. Whitlow, Raymond (SUNY Buffalo) [117] Linking Spatial Theories and Archaeological Data with the help of Formal Ontology As information systems have become increasingly specialized, GIS users have adopted formal ontology to ensure semantic interoperability between subfields. Formal ontology has two advantages for archaeologists concerned with spatial analysis: first, the metatheoretical definition of spatial concepts in archaeology and archaeological theory, and second, the development of geodatabases which accurately reflect those concepts. Using Basic Formal Ontology`s SNAP-SPAN, a modular and spatio-temporal ontology, I discuss the appropriate level of representation for a set of archaeological data and demonstrate the utility of formal ontology to archaeology by linking space-time geography concepts to a geodatabase of Neolithic sites in Romania. Whittaker, William (University of Iowa) [85] Limitations of Expectations: Ground-Penetrating Radar Survey of Five Frontier Forts Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) survey of five frontier forts in the Upper Midwest reveal that expectations about the location and survival of fort-era features can affect interpretation of GPR results. Discussed are GPR survey results from Fort Johnson (1814), Second Fort Crawford (1829), Fort Atkinson (1840), Fort Des Moines No. 2 (1843), and Fort Dodge (1850). Two of these fort surveys produced no useful data, the remaining three produced different levels of coherence and conformity to expected features.

Whittle, Alasdair (Cardiff University) [61] The Language of Difference: Early Neolithic Society in Southern Britain in the First Half of the Fourth Millennium Cal BC How do we go about characterising the nature of social relations in early Neolithic (first half of the fourth millennium cal BC) societies in southern Britain, and elsewhere? Top-down evolutionary approaches seem to carry too much generalising baggage and too many prior assumptions, and we end in a mire of diversity, with imprecise and unspecific terms like 'pre-chiefdom`' or 'transegalitarian'. A bottom-up approach may be much more fruitful, though that may still require us to pull in terms like 'lineage' or 'descent group' or 'community' from a wider, generalising literature. Combined, however, with the new chronological framework provided by the completion of a recent major dating project, in conjunction with Bayesian modelling, such an approach offers the opportunity to examine the emergence of specific variation in time and space in new detail. This paper concentrates on the 38th and 37th centuries cal BC in southern Britain. Whittlesey, Stephanie [248] The Middle Archaic Period in the Tucson Basin Maize appeared in late Middle Archaic contexts in the Tucson Basin as early as 2100 B.C. Farming features such as ditches, architectural structures, and other evidence of long-term residential stability are absent, however, and the population was extremely small. This supports models that suggest maize did not transform lifeways initially (e.g., Wills 1988) and calls our attention to processes that produced the irrigation systems, formal architecture, and high population density of the San Pedro phase. This paper offers some possibilities for explaining this rapid and extraordinary transition. [141] Discussant; [158] see Reid, J Jefferson Wiant, Michael (Illinois State Museum--Dickson Mounds) [173] Deep Site Methodology: A View from Koster At Koster site, archaeologists discovered 13 stratigraphically distinct middens: the deepest of which is 8.6 m below ground surface, the most extensive of which has an area of at least 1,000 square meters. During a decade of investigation, methods of discovery, excavation, documentation, recovery, and analysis evolved, as did understanding of the archaeological potential of landscapes. These developments ushered in profound changes in archaeological methods, especially those applicable to the discovery and excavation of deep, stratified, multi-component deposits. Despite these advances, there remain stiff challenges in deep site archaeology, not the least of which is that posed by thick middens.

Were individuals living in urban Chinatowns preparing different foods for their families than Chinese American cooks serving non-Chinese? What can culinary patterns such as these tell us about ethnogenesis and culture change in 19th Century North America?

Williams, Justin (Washington State University) [190] Variability within Nodule Choice of Modern Flint Knappers Ten Flint Knappers were asked to examine ten flint nodules and asked to assess the suitability of each nodule for reduction into several pre-designated lithic tool types. The ten nodules were of the same raw material and approximately the same weight. There were significant differences in the opinions of the flint knappers pertaining to the suitability of the nodules for various types of reduction. This suggests that the source of variability in lithic tools and debitage lies not only in the production of the tool, the shape and size of raw materials, but also the perceptions of various flint knappers.

Three small pigs were used as a substitution for child-sized remains. Two pigs, one in a black plastic bag, were placed in commercial dumpsters and the third placed on the ground as a control. The data suggests the decomposition rate of remains placed in a dumpster will be noticeably inhibited when compared to remains outside dumpsters. Willis, Lauren (University of Oregon), Andrew R.

However, cut marks are rarely observed on fish bone from archaeological sites, despite various ethnographic studies that describe fish butchering techniques for consumption and drying. To test the discrepancy between the experimental results and archaeological observations, we buried 13 butchered fish skeletons for 27 months to observe whether the cut marks are still visible after exposure to post-depositional taphonomic processes. These results contribute to the understanding and interpretation of taphonomy, aquatic faunal assemblages, and prehistoric butchering practices.

We focus on these conceptual realignments in the northern Southwest between AD 600 and 940 and look for evidence of this transformation in rock art, architecture, and Tanoan languages. We illustrate several findings. Among them is that ritual knowledge appears to have been distinct from, but correlated with, household status in the economic and political realms. In contrast, during the period of early village formation knowledge and status came to be associated with specific lineages.

In order to really think about the totality of Cahokia, sites on the west side of the Mississippi River and elsewhere also have to be considered. In my observations from an indigenous perspective, Cahokia consisted of pre-tribal people ­ the Dhegiha and perhaps the Chiwere Sioux--and, as in any river city, people brought goods for trade and distribution. Not only was Cahokia a place for exchange of goods but for ideas. In this paper I will explore those topics as well as the importance of the sites to American Indian people today.

This work takes an assemblage approach to understanding the structure of the lithic economy in use at the site, in order to examine mobility, site structure, household makeup, and ritual in the western Great Lakes during the early Holocene (circa 8600 BP). The study is focused on the structure of the Plainview lithic economies, examining tools and debitage to determine how groups in the western Great Lakes created, modified, and maintained their tool kits.

[91] Maya Settlement Patterns in Northwestern Belize: Environmental Relations, Resource Availability and Local Site-Planning Traditions Nearly two decades of formal and informal survey work in northwestern Belize, combined with similar detailed research in adjacent portions of Mexico and Belize have yielded a large database of Maya settlement patterns. In this discussion, we argue that the locations of centers with public architecture as well as smaller communities can best be understood in terms of their relationship to critical resources--particularly agricultural lands. Also important in regards to these settlements is the relative degree of continuity between the built Maya world and the natural environment. Further, the locations of some macro-centers within the Northwestern Belize area can only be understood in relation to other local settlements.

This poster presents a study utilizing a portable x-ray fluorescence (pXRF) instrument to analyze slates used by Maritime Archaic groups. This technique was tested because it is nondestructive and can directly analyze artifacts. The results are mixed, with some success at discerning broad patterns in slate distribution and identifying preferred use of certain slates for specific tool types, but limited in the evaluation of exchange of materials from specific procurement locations.

Popular explanations include human overkill, abrupt climate change, and more recently, extraterrestrial impact. The popularity of these arguments is based on two factors: 1) the dependence on and overutilization of analogy and 2) the catastrophic nature of the explanations, allowing the creation of a global model. Focusing on the human overkill argument, we explore explanations based on flawed comparisons. This, along with an overview of the history of analogy in archaeology and ecology, shows the inherent problems with global models of these extinctions, and why these remain the most popular explanations.

Landscape-scale geoarchaeological investigations show widespread, severe soil erosion in densely populated areas during the 12th Century. A program of OSL and radiocarbon dating, along with a comparison of the history of landscape change in two surveyed areas, shows that environmental degradation during the Islamic period was anthropogenic. A detailed consideration of the processes of landscape change, augmented by archaeological and documentary data, provides insights into the complex human-environment interactions that ultimately led to catastrophic degradation.

The fields are located in the intermediary zones between a main canal, two distribution canals,

and at least four lateral canals. Contrasting sediment morphology, paleobotany, and chemical signatures have been documented between hypothesized fields and natural strata. The excellent preservation of the fields is attributed to their depth of burial and position at the distal end of an alluvial fan. These factors allow for one of the most comprehensive views of Hohokam irrigated fields unearthed to date.

Wu, Chia-chin (UC Berkeley) [74] The Impacts of Food Processing on Parenchymous Tissue of Roots and Tubers: the Diagnostic Value of a Tissue Degradation Attributional Analysis in Identifying Specific Drying and Cooking Transformations The nature of food processing activities and the inevitable impact they have on parenchymous tissues can be understood through physical and anatomical changes observable in systematically processed tubers. Roots and tubers were subjected to detailed food processing activities, which damaged the parenchymous tissue and modified its anatomy in specific ways. Tuber processing stages produce distinctive, identifiable damage in some tuber species. These various attributes are diagnostic and can be useful for identifying taphonomic, cultural transformations, and identities of roots and tubers. The focus of this study is to present the various tissue degrading attributes resulted from tuber processing events to illuminate their diagnostic value.

Prehistoric sites along the West Fork of the Trinity River frequently reveal very limited stone tool assemblages with equally limited expressions of formal features. Recognition of distinct activity areas is frequently difficult. Site 41TR198 offers a unique data set related to use of the West Fork flood plain between 2300 and 500 years B.P. Multiple data sets recovered from discrete living surfaces suggest that groups frequenting the site may have been distinct from those exploiting the woodlands/prairie ecotone elsewhere. The presence of distinctive thermal features and a diverse faunal assemblage contribute to an emerging synthesis of northcentral Texas archaeology. Wyatt, Scott [84] see Speller, Camilla F.

Four functional groups were distinguished according to use-wear patterns. Most axes appear to have been used for multiple purposes. According to experimental results, tree felling and wood cutting produce the least pronounced edge damage, and wear traces from these activities could be easily removed or obscured by damage from other functions. High-power microscopy, and perhaps residue analyses, would be useful for examining the portion of the axe bevels some distance from the working edge as a means of determining both initial and secondary functions of these artifacts.

By placing sacrificial offerings, building a canal and basin complex, and erecting buildings on and around the platform, they reconfigured the Pumapunku to create a venue appropriate for Inka rituals, and they transformed this sacred space to better fit Inka worldview and cosmogony.

Island San Clemente Island has evidence of occupation for more than 9,000 years, during which the prehistoric economies were strongly marine oriented. The distribution of island sites is generally consistent with this, with these optimally located to provide viewsheds across the surrounding ocean where resources moved important to humans, such as sea mammals and inter-island boat traffic. Within this prehistoric landscape there are also anomalies associated with apparent ceremonial sites. We examine the cultural dynamics implied in these sites` viewsheds, as well as those suggested by potential for reciprocal viewsheds among San Clemente Island, nearby Santa Catalina Island, and the California mainland.

Two Middle Horizon contexts were studied: the first was a cave filled with mummies that dates stylistically to the Middle Horizon 1, and the second a semi-subterranean structure packed with post-mortem offerings dating to Middle Horizon 2. By tracing changes in the artifact assemblage over time, we can begin to understand the dynamic events occurring in the Majes valley and their relationship to the Wari state.

Technological and use-wear analyzes reveal that adzes were made and used in similar ways - primarily for heavy woodworking, possibly for manufacturing canoes. Dalton toolkits are highly formalized, consisting of adzes, scrapers, and points used both as projectiles and knives. Dalton assemblages are often considered late Paleoindian. We argue that Dalton toolkits are hallmarks of an Archaic tradition that focused on woodland and riverine resources. Dalton foragers were the first groups to settle, fully utilize, and occupy the Mississippi Valley and adjacent Ozarks. Yerkes, Richard [61] see Parkinson, William A.

First, we analyze variations within the ceramic assemblage to gain further understanding of the rituals that created political bonds between the Inka state and this community. Second, we examine ceramics from chronologicallycontrolled domestic structures to infer how colonial influences affected ritual and daily routines during the first post-conquest generation. The results indicate significant differences between ritual and domestic assemblages, and between the assemblages of households of different status. Yingst, James R. [219] see Sasso, Robert F.

In addition, the replacement of stemmed points with side-notched styles suggests broad cultural changes at 9000 BP. Yoffee, Norman (University of Michigan) [15] Discussant Yohe II, Robert M.

Young, Tatiana (Temple University) [109] Independence rather than Domination of Smaller Sites in Quintana Roo, Mexico It becomes increasingly difficult to maintain a hierarchical model as continuing data suggests independence of smaller sites through economic specialization. To adapt to the rain forest environment ancient Maya employed multifaceted agricultural strategies dependant upon the soil type, vegetation and landscape features. This approach differs greatly from Western monoculture which relies on a single agricultural technique employed in extensive vicinity. Settlement pattern was comprised of a mixture of farms and residences, which promoted economic self-sufficiency to the ancient Maya (agricultural facets were present in the core of some cities). Dispersion amongst the continual occupation did not reflect any tangible boundary between "urban" and "rural" settlements. Rather, smaller sites maintained independence from the domination of larger sites by means of economic self-sufficiency. Youssef, Sam [58] see Moncel, Marie-Hélène Yu, Pei-Lin (Ca. State U.

If so, the proliferation of ground stone in the arid zone during the Holocene signals the simultaneous emergence of fire-managed landscapes. We use foraging theory to model managed habitat mosaics relative to contemporary occupation sites in the Martu territory of Western Australia to generate testable predictions about the distribution and organization of ground stone technology.

Planning Bison Kills on the Two Medicine River, Montana The Two Medicine River of north-central Montana preserves abundant surface evidence for Late Prehistoric bison drive lanes, kill sites, encampments, and stone alignments which, together, demonstrate long-term success of communal bison hunting. Extensive drive lines insinuate themselves as a reasonable means to predict kill site locations; yet, drive lanes lead directly to stratified bone beds only in some cases. The absence of bone at the terminus of drive lanes must be explained as a result of taphonomy or the absence of a kill event. We review drive line placement and discuss the preparation and risk involved in the communal hunt.

In previous studies of archaeoastronomical phenomena at the Valdivia site of Real Alto, coastal Ecuador (Zeidler 1984, 1998), overall community plan and individual structure orientations between Phases 3 and 7 were discussed in terms of a pronounced intercardinality, after which several different celestial phenomena were suggested as possible alignments. One question left unanswered, however, is why the domestic structures don`t face inward toward the central plaza, as is common in Amerindian circular villages throughout South America. This paper addresses that issue by exploring the spatial patterning of similarly oriented dwellings at disparate locations within the village configuration. Zeidler, James [164] see Rush, Laurie W.
