ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 76TH ANNUAL MEETING

ABSTRACTS OF INDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS are presented. La Quinta predates the construction of the town`s church in A.D. 1610 and is architecturally distinct from other colonial buildings in the region. Along with Spanish architectural attributes, analysis identified Inca elements, including portions of a building incorporated into the chapel. This fusion may reflect imperial conquest strategies, including the cooption of important places and syncretism. Lastly, the study places La Quinta within the context of the extensive history of reoccupation and modification at this prominent site. Abraham, Shinu (St. Lawrence University), P. J. Cherian (Kerala Council for Historical Research) and Heather Christie (St. Lawrence University) [100] Pattanam/Muziris: The Glass Bead Corpus from an Indian Ocean Port Site on the Malabar Coast of Kerala, India Recent excavations at Pattanam on the southwestern Indian coast have yielded a variety of artifacts attesting to robust participation in early and medieval Indian Ocean exchange networks. These artifacts include glass beads from nearly all occupation levels. I will report on the beads from the 2007/2008 excavation seasons, comprising about 4000 of the total 20,000 recovered to date. As one of the few south Indian sites providing stratigraphic context for this artifact category, the Pattanam beads present a unique opportunity to investigate this port site as a node linking local production processes with inter-regional transoceanic systems. [100] Second Chair [100] Second Organizer Ackerly, Neal (Dos Rios Consultants, Inc.) [199] A River In Need of Irrigation: Searching for Prehistoric Irrigation Systems Along the Rio Grande Main Stem One puzzlement in southern New Mexico prehistory is the relative dearth of evidence regarding prehistoric irrigation along the Rio Grande main stem. This is particularly true of the segment extending south between San Marcial and El Paso. Today, vast floodplains are cultivated to their limits, yet evidence of prehistoric irrigation systems in these same geographies is sorely wanting. Anecdotal accounts, early maps, and other documentary sources are discussed that may provide insights into what kinds of irrigation systems may be present, why they may be difficult to find, and where along this segment archeological investigations may be most productive.

Abbott, David (Arizona State University), Sophia Kelly (Arizona State University), Andrew Lack (Arizona State University) and Margaret Beck (University of Iowa) [187] The Provenance of Patayan Pottery from the Patayan Enclave at Las Colinas Numerous Patayan ceramics in a full suite of vessel forms suggest the presence of a Patayan enclave at the prehistoric Hohokam village of Las Colinas in the Phoenix basin of Arizona. We investigate if the Patayan pottery was locally made by chemically assaying temper particles of phyllite with an electron microprobe and comparing them to the chemical signatures of bedrock phyllite from the flank of the nearby Phoenix Mountains. Our findings demonstrate unambiguous differences between the temper fragments and the raw Phoenix Mountains samples, suggesting that the Patayan pottery was not made at Las Colinas.

Peabody Museum - Phillips Academy) and Forrest Cox (Phillips Academy) [196] Can an Elite High School and a North American Archaeological Museum Succeed in Giving Back to Indian Country In this paper the trials, pitfalls and successes of matriculating Native students into an independent residential high school are presented. What do schools and archaeological museums have to offer contemporary Native students and how do they position themselves to deliver those needs? Can museums play a role in helping these students adjust to their milieu and to help educate the broader school community on current Native issues? Attempts to partner with Native students and their communities to fashion new avenues of cross-cultural dialogue between museums, indigenous peoples, and the community at-large are discussed. Aben, Kathrina (Howard University) [138] Comparison of Miner Encampments in the Black Range Mountains, New Mexico In the late 1800's, the community of Hermosa in the Black Range of New Mexico, centered its economic stability around silver mining. This poster will explore the purpose of two sites found in the area related to mining occupation: a single-room structure situated on a flat area next to Palomas Creek, and a wall fortification built on top of a hill facing the town. A cross-comparison and analysis of artifacts, oral history and architectural remains will help determine the function of each area and flesh out the identities of the individuals whose occupation was so principal to the region.

Adams, Jacob (University of Montana) and Douglas MacDonald (University of Montana) [160] Differential Selection of Lithic Raw Materials by Prehistoric Hunter-Gatherers in the Upper Yellowstone River Valley, Montana/Wyoming The Upper Yellowstone River Valley of Montana/Wyoming in Yellowstone National Park provides an excellent case study by which to evaluate direct versus embedded stone procurement strategies during prehistory. Two lithic raw material sources--Obsidian Cliff obsidian and Crescent Hill chert --are located equidistant from archaeological sites in the study area, but were differentially utilized during the Holocene. Attributes such as stone morphology, quality, and availability, not to mention individual/cultural influences, contributed to the variable procurement, use, and discard of stone by hunter-gatherers at sites in the region. Adams, Jeffrey (Interior West Consulting), John Kennedy (SWCA Environmental Consultants) and Mark Lowe (Interior West Consulting) [179] Archaeological investigations along the terraces of the Upper Green River, Wyoming The study included a 365-acre area along T1-T3 terraces of the Upper Green River at the BLM Warren Bridge Public Access Area, Sublette County, Wyoming. The investigations included pedestrian survey (15 meter intervals), broadcast shovel probe surveys (419 probes at 19 locations), excavation of 5 test units, and excavation of 3 thermal features. A total of 15 prehistoric archaeological sites (14 with subsurface deposits) and 9 isolated finds were documented. Sites contained lithic debitage and tools, projectile points, ceramics, faunal remains, fire-altered rock, and rock-filled roasting pits. Radiometric dates were obtained from features at 3 sites. Adams, Jenny (Desert Archaeology, Inc.) [59] Use-Wear on Surfaces ­ Stepping Away from the Edge Recent applications of experimental and microscopic research techniques to the study of stone tool surfaces have broadened the recognition of use-wear patterns. Building on the research of tribologists who study wear in order to prevent it, wear mechanisms have been identified that are distinctive to the relative nature of contacts between two surfaces in addition to the nature of substances worked between contacting surfaces. Wear mechanisms encompass surface fatigue, adhesion, abrasion, and tribochemical interactions that are continuously in play, so that what we see depends on when this process was interrupted. Adams, Jenny [22] see Burton, Margie Adams, Karen R. (Crow Canyon Archaeological Center) [199] The Archaeobotany and Agronomy of Ancient Maize: We're Still Learning Understanding the introduction and movements of maize (Zea mays) landraces in the ancient American Southwest

would offer insight into the history and interactions of human groups. Many historic maize landraces are morphologically distinguishable. However, most archaeological maize has preserved in charred and fragmented condition, and modern charring/breakage experiments suggest chances for determining ancient landraces are diminished. For modeling maize productivity, controlled grow-outs of indigenous SW US maize landraces indicate relevance of environmental variables (precipitation timing, cumulative growing season heat units, effects of cold air drainage) not routinely considered by archaeologists.

Adams, Ron (AINW) [160] Columbia Hills Toolstone Quarrying Archaeological investigations in the Columbia Hills of south-central Washington have revealed myriad sources of cryptocrystalline silicate toolstone material. Densely clustered prehistoric cryptocrystalline silicate quarries and smaller lithic procurement sites are scattered across the crest of the hills. The lithic material found at these procurement locales is of exceptional quality and ideal for tool making. Prehistorically, this toolstone resource was dug from mining pits and reduced from large boulders that scatter the surface. This paper explores toolstone procurement strategies of the Columbia Hills and their significance in relation to prehistoric village sites of the area and the larger regional lithic landscape.

Wilkinson (Winchester University, UK) [114] Current Palaeolithic research at Nor Geghi 1 and Lusakert Cave 1, Armenia Current Palaeolithic research in the Southern Caucasus, specifically Armenia, is beginning to yield new insights into the Pleistocene occupation of the region. Two Armenian sites, Nor Geghi 1 and Lusakert Cave 1, span the late Middle and Upper Pleistocene, and document intriguing patterns of lithic procurement/production and foraging. This paper will present preliminary data gathered during recent excavations (2008­2010) followed by a brief comparison with sites located in neighboring regions. Adler, Michael (Southern Methodist University) [199] What we don't know about canal irrigation in the Prehispanic Northern Southwest Prehispanic canal irrigation is archaeologically well documented in the Sonoran desert regions of the American Southwest, but the same is not the case in the northern Southwest. This paper investigates evidence (and lack thereof) for prehispanic canal irrigation across the northern Southwest, particularly the northern Rio

Challenges to our present knowledge of the spatial and temporal extent of canal irrigation in this region include limited contact period accounts, a dearth of archaeological investigations of purported canals, dating of archaeological deposits, and historic land modifications by later occupants of the region. Adolph, Arthur [176] see Billy, Nora Adovasio, James (Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute) and C. Andrew Hemmings (Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute/Mercyhurst College) [265] Inundated Landscapes and the Colonization of the Northeastern Gulf of Mexico The initial colonization of the Americas probably occurred somewhere on the edge of the now-submerged Inner Continental Shelf. Continued research at inundated locations in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico is facilitating the reconstruction of a portion of this ancient landform. Extensive Paleo-river drainages, interfluvial ridges, and chert-bearing limestone exposures have been identified at multiple loci. Based on terrestrial analogues, those features could have influenced human and animal movements to and from the ever encroaching sea at the end of the Pleistocene. Findings are summarized and suggestions are offered to verify an early human presence on this shrinking Pleistocene landscape. Adovasio, James [196] see Richardson, James B. Adriano-Morán, Carmen Cristina [25] see McClung De Tapia, Emily S. Afonso, Marisa [253] Archaeological approaches to ritual in Southeastern Brazil: shell mounds and Tupi Guarani sites Ritual analysis still poses challenges to archaeologists. This paper intends to discuss the role of shell and lithic artefacts as archaeological evidences of rituals in shell mounds and also the role of ceramic vessels associated with funerary functions located in Tupi Guarani sites in Southeastern Brazil, specifically from archaeological investigations conducted in the State of São Paulo. Shell mounds and ceramic sites present very different archaeological and funerary contexts. Ethnoarchaeological studies may help understanding funerary rituals in Tupi Guarani sites, even though shell mound building communities were no longer active at the time European colonizers arrived in Brazil. Agarwal, Sabrina (UC Berkeley) [16] The Sex and Gender of Aging in Bioarchaeology This paper examines how the fundamental use of biological sex and age determination in skeletal remains affects and can limit our analyses of bioarchaeological data and the questions that we ask, particularly in the study of gender in health and aging in the past. Using empirical data on patterns bone loss in aging in historical populations, I suggest that the division of populations into categories by sex and age may well obscure the biocultural influences that have been embodied in the skeleton over the life course, and cut across populations in different and revealing ways.

The work was conducted on Beaver Lake in the Ozark Mountains, near Nimrod Lake in the northern Ouachita Mountains, and near Millwood Lake in the Red River Valley region. Some of these Prehistoric sites are large and produced several hundred artifacts, helping us understand more about Arkansas` prehistory and past land use.

The research goals include the examination of inter- and intra-island trade among free and enslaved Africans. The results suggest evidence for inter-island, but are ambiguous in regard to trade networks. The data show local variation in the islands' markets as many different paste recipes are represented in the St. Eustatius AfroCaribbean ware, but there are fewer paste recipes in the St. Kitts and Nevis Afro-Caribbean ware. Ahlman, Todd [121] see Braly, Bobby R. Ahlstrom, Richard (HRA, Inc. Conservation Archaeology) [99] Temporal and Spatial Scales of Analysis in Puebloan Dendroarchaeology Dendrochronological evidence is not distributed evenly over systemic and archaeological contexts, but clusters within realms involving specific categories of material culture. A realm central to Jeffrey Dean`s dendroarchaeological research concerns southwest puebloan architecture. The scope of puebloan dendroarchaeology is a function of puebloan wood-use, datability of exploited tree species, preservation of treering materials, and patterns of archaeological fieldwork. The quality of the sample of tree-ring-dated events varies by scale of analysis. Relevant temporal scales include tree-ring seasons and years as well as multi-year units. Dendroarchaeology contributes to puebloan spatial analysis at the levels of behavioral, geographic, and social space. Ahrens, Corrie (Colorado State University) and Christopher T.

Food storage has long been seen as an important aspect of economic and socio-political relationships in Mesoamerica. Evidence for potential storage structures has been identified at the site of Sacapu Angamucu, located in the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin, Michoacán, Mexico. Here I examine the spatial distribution of these granaries to provide insights into economic relationships, sociopolitical differentiation, and site function during the Postclassic period (A.D. 1000-1520). Aikens, Clyde (University of Oregon) [94] Introducing Don Fowler Introducing Don Fowler By C. Melvin Aikens Don Fowler has finally become older than dirt, not considered a bad thing by people such as we here today, some having grown old in the profession of archaeology, others still trudging toward that goal, and some perhaps starting to wonder if they really want to. On this occasion we celebrate Don`s long and productive history of accomplishment in our chosen field, and my purpose today is to briefly sketch his trajectory as a scholar, which began more than a half-century ago in Ogden, Utah. Aimers, Jim (SUNY Geneseo) and Helen Haines (Trent University) [243] The Pottery of Ka'Kabish, Belize In this paper we report on pottery from the site core of Ka`Kabish, Belize excavated during the summer of 2009. Given the proximity of Ka`Kabish to the site of Lamanai (about 10 km), which is well-known for its substantial Postclassic period occupation, we had expected to find substantial quantities of Postclassic period pottery. Instead, almost the entire pottery sample consisted of types associated with the Late Preclassic and Early Classic periods in the Maya lowlands. We describe the key types uncovered in 2009 and we speculate on their significance in terms of chronology and the regional role of Ka`Kabish. [243] First Chair Aimers, Jim [190] see Murata, Satoru Ainis, Amira (California State University, Los Angeles) and Renè Vellanoweth (California State University, Los Angeles) [263] Historical Ecology of Bay Point, San Miguel Island: 6,000 Years of Intertidal Shellfish and Human Dynamics Shellfish remains from Cave of the Chimneys (CA-SMI603) a stratigraphically intact, extremely well-preserved site located on the northeast coast of the island provides an ideal opportunity to examine long term dynamics between humans and intertidal shellfish communities. Our results suggest fluctuating patterns of resource depressions and rebounds, foraging efficiency, and subsistence intensification and diversification through time. Trans-Holocene patterns also show decreases in shell size, increases in foraging catchments, and decreases in shellfish use relative to marine vertebrates. This research contributes to our understanding of the historical ecology of Bay Point and the evolution of subsistence economies on the Channel Islands.

To manage and compare burial practices from projects in the Tewa and Galisteo Basins, a data base was created that could summarize demography, grave location and characteristics, body position, and grave goods as well as explore patterns within and between sites. A regional data base would not only allow us to examine a wide range of questions but would improve our reporting and recording of burial encountered in the future. [237] see Toll, H. Wolcott Akoshima, Kaoru (Tohoku University) [149] The Tagajo Fort Site and frontier processes in northeastern Japan during the eighth century A.D. The paper examines socio-cultural processes in northern border regions of the Ritsuryo State of Japan. I introduce the results of fifty years long research, mainly conducted by the Tagajo Fort Site Research Institute of Miyagi Prefecture. Accumulated data revealed details of the fort structure, spatial differentiation, and renovation of buildings. Its geographical location confronting the northern Emishi tribal territory doomed the site both political and military roles integrated as the frontier fort. State-controlled production is represented in abundant roof tile kiln sites. Regional differences within the Mutsu Province between north and south are discussed in historical and peripheral perspectives. Albarracin-Jordan, Juan [231] see Capriles, José M.

Becker (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) [245] Trophy Head Taking in the Eastern Tiwanaku Peripheries: The Site of Wata Wata in the Charazani Valley, Bolivia The taking of trophy heads is not a new concept among precontact peoples in Andean South America. However among Tiwanaku skeletal collections, physical evidence of human crania being processed is a rare phenomenon. This paper reports on three crania found in ritual context at the Wata Wata site in Charazani, Bolivia. The skeletal remains show evidence of trauma consistent with sacrifice including decapitation, cut marks, bone breakage, and possible eye removal. These data provide new information concerning the nature of violence, ritual, and social interactions that Tiwanaku maintained with the eastern, Charazani populations during the Formative to Tiwanaku-era transition.

These materials use archaeology to teach Montana students historical and scientific inquiry with authentic archaeological data. Crow tribal members, educators and archaeologists collaborated to develop the educational materials with Crow community members providing the enduring understandings, or main concepts, for the materials. This paper will discuss the learning outcomes of the Crow students who piloted the materials, and the connections they make between the archaeological record and their own lives. Alexander, Elise (AMNH and CUNY Graduate Center) [131] Postclassic Jalieza: a hillside settlement in the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico This report presents preliminary results from a program of systematic survey, including topographic mapping and controlled, intensive surface collecting, at the Postclassic component of Jalieza. This single phase settlement was inhabited after the decline of the Monte Alban-based Zapotec state, but before the Late Postclassic cacicazgos documented in the codices, thus offering a useful window into an understudied time period. The research design focuses primarily on household composition and site layout. A preliminary assessment of the ceramic assemblage explores features that may help define an early Period V/ Liobaa occupation, further refining the ceramic sequence for the Valley of Oaxaca.

Structural elements, artifacts and charcoal are found in all four houses excavated by a multidisciplinary research team since 2009. In this paper, we present preliminary results of a multi-tiered approach to analyze the availability and use of wood at the various times the houses were occupied between AD 1100-1700. Systematic analysis of archaeological remains coupled with tree-ring analysis of modern and sub-modern driftwood are performed to explore the relationship (if any) between climate, wood availability, settlement patterns and construction practices.

Over the past fifteen years, archaeologists have excavated internment camps to help draw attention to the history of the United States' imprisonment of Japanese Americans. This paper outlines archaeological studies and public outreach taking place at Northern Idaho's Kooskia Internment Camp and considers how this research can contribute to historical and archaeological knowledge of the broader internee experience. Allen, Kathleen M. (University of Pittsburgh), and Sandra Katz (University of Pittsburgh) [55] Iroquoian Settlements in Central New York State in the Sixteenth Century: A Case Study of Intra- and Intersite Diversity Iroquoian settlement studies have shifted away from normative views of similar large villages on the landscape to more dynamic approaches that focus attention on the diversity of site types present. Large villages, hamlets, camps, and a multitude of special purpose sites have been identified. Comparisons between these sites have led to greater understanding of the range of activities carried out at any one time and the ways in which Iroquoian populations responded to challenges in the political, social and physical environment. Investigations at two settlements in the Allegheny Uplands of central New York have focused on recovering settlement pattern information. Comparisons of site sizes, structure diversity, and the types and amounts of cultural material show patterning supporting variability both within and between the sites in the intensity of occupation and the emphasis on specific activities. The implications of this research for understanding settlement variability and improving data recovery techniques to allow for more detailed comparative studies are discussed. Allen, Kathleen [164] see Katz, Sandra Allen, Mark (California State Polytechnic University, Pomona) [48] California: A Land of Violence Archaeologists now commonly consider the role of warfare in the past, with the notable exception of less complex hunter-gatherer societies. Lacking fortifications, mass casualties in cemeteries, or specialized weapons, they are often assumed to have been essentially peaceful. California demonstrates this tendency well. There have been numerous investigations of warfare in cultures characterized by sedentism, hierarchy, and other

The first systematically recovered assemblages of plant and animal remains from an openair Early Neolithic (EN) site in Albania provide the first glimpse of the environmental conditions that early farmers had to negotiate in this former wetland setting and the choices in land management that they made. Radiocarbon dates from the site place its earliest occupation in the mid-seventh millennium B.C., contemporary with EN sites in Greece, to its south. Almer, Jon [220] see Friedman, Elizabeth S.

Caborn-Welborn sites were arranged in a hierarchy from large villages, to small villages, through hamlets and to farmsteads. Studies of human carbon stable isotope ratios from the Slack Farm site, a large Caborn-Welborn village, indicate that maize consumption was highly variable at this large site. Stable carbon -isotope ratios from human burials from the villages of Hovey Lake and Murphy are used to assess intra- and inter-community dietary variation within the Caborn-Welborn phase. Alt, Susan (Indiana University Bloomington) [229] Persons, Places, Things: Hybrid Moments and the Processes of Change Culture contact studies usually focus on dramatic situations such as conquest and colonization. Such studies have driven the development of diverse theoretical tools. But, as I will argue, the same processes entailed in dramatic contact situations are present in less fraught encounters, and operate even under less dramatic circumstances. Using examples from the Cahokia region I will discuss the utility of deploying insights from culture contact studies in explicating social and political change when contact relates to migration. I also suggest that encounters with difference are not

limited to persons; things and places can engender the same kinds of processes.

Nevertheless, the recognition of the reduction sequence at both quarries and domestic workshops of ground-stone implements (such as metates) has received little attention.

The adaptability of dogs may have contributed to the influence and use of this animal in various activities. Furthermore, the presence of dog iconography and ceramic figurines highlights the multi-dimensional importance of this species in daily and ritual activity. An examination of the morphological and physiological variation in three types of dogs is analyzed to determine their impact within Formative Mesoamerica. Results from this study contribute to an emerging pattern in humananimal relationships throughout Mesoamerica.

Reciprocal gift-giving (xaro) networks among the !Kung spanned up to 200 km, opening rights of access to distant territories, thereby reducing risk in unpredictable environments. Carbon, oxygen and strontium isotope analysis of San beads from five regions were conduced to evaluate the potential of this technique for testing hypotheses of differences in prehistoric exchange network sizes in risky Pleistocene versus stable Holocene environments. Our results show that strontium isotope differ between regions and sometimes within necklaces. Carbon and oxygen isotopes distinguish beads made from different eggshells within regions. Ameri, Marta (Fashion Institute of Technology) [47] Seals, Sealing and Regional Identity in the Harappan World The study of Harappan seals has long focused on their role as supports for the Indus script or on the possible mythological scenes depicted on a few of the extant artifacts The function of the seals as administrative objects and as markers of identity has until recently received less attention. Accordingly, this paper utilizes the art historical methodologies long used in the study of Ancient Near Eastern glyptic to examine the stylistic and iconographic attributes of seals from geographically distant sites in the Indus, analyzing the ways in which seals functioned as markers of both personal and regional identity.

Anders, Jake (University of Alaska-Anchorage) [27] Rethinking upland "Places" in Aleutian Archaeology Recent research conducted on archaeological sites in upland areas of Adak Island provides a new avenue for discussion about the pre-contact people of the Aleutian Islands. Past interpretations of Unangan populations were based on settlement models placing the greatest value on coastal habitations and almost no importance on upland areas, implicitly finding them devoid of

meaning. The presence of upland concentrations of substantial cultural depressions establishes that areas away from large coastal habitations are significant.

Human remains collected from this cave site include male, female and juvenile individuals dating from the historic-contact period. This project documents and analyzes the wide range of taphonomic processes that have affected these remains. These processes include perimortem chop marks, surface bleaching and burning. Based on these observations, violence and partial cremation of some individuals is suggested. Anderson, David (Tulane University) [14] Cultural Identity Issues: Life in the Preclassic Northern Maya Lowlands The recent boom in known Preclassic sites in the Northern Maya Lowlands has raised questions about many aspects of Maya cultural development, including the relationship between the North and the Southern Maya heartland. We need to ask how these Northerners viewed themselves and their relationship with the heartland. Did the Northern Maya see themselves as peers to the Southerners? Did they view the South as a role model, or as an annoyingly more successful sibling? Using newly reported data from across the region, these identity issues will be explored in an attempt to understand and contextualize Northern Maya Preclassic culture.

Shane Miller (University of Arizona) and William Haas (University of Arizona) [155] Reconceptualizing Clovis Mobility: Sites and Projectile Point Distributions in North America Archaeologists typically conceptualize prehistoric populations along a theoretical continuum between extremes of sedentism and mobility. We use the concept of spatial autocorrelation to re-conceptualize residential mobility along a tripartite gradient ranging between clustered, random, and dispersed. This slight modification allows us to interpret spatial and temporal variation in Clovis artifact distributions from the Paleoindian Database of the Americas (PIDBA). We find that the rank-size plots of projectile point counts by county tend to follow Zipf distributions, but variation in the exponents (log-log slopes) suggest varying degrees of mobility across time and space.

Anderson, Kirk (Museum of Northern Arizona, Flagstaff) and Ted Neff (Museum of Northern Arizona) [20] Out of site formation processes, geoarchaeology, and the archaeological record of Grand Canyon, Arizona Recent NPS/MNA sponsored excavations in Grand Canyon integrate site formation processes into archaeological interpretations of past human behavior. Investigations of natural site formation processes (paleofloods, distal debris fan activity, colluviation, ponding, eolian activity) properly re-focuses geomorphic research onto sites and the surrounding landscape, allowing researchers to arrive at reasonable interpretations of cultural history and landscape changes interpreted through the filter of geoarchaeology. New data and interpretations include paleoflood influences on Pueblo II settlement patterns, use of original layout of exhumed agricultural hamlets to evaluate loss to erosion, and Holocene chronostratigraphy to reconstruct landscapes during early farmstead habitations.

Environmental changes and cycles of coastal storminess are recorded across the 3,642 hectare ridge complex, which preserves the most extensive evidence of Late Holocene coastal occupation in the North American Arctic. Paleoenvironmental fluctuations altered resource availability and habitability of this landscape by coastal peoples who adapted in part through changes in settlement, subsistence and technology. Study of high resolution paleoenvironmental and archaeological records at Cape Krusenstern informs explanations of maritime hunter-gatherer evolution in the North and beyond. Anderson, Shelby [159] see Freeburg, Adam K. Andersson, Anna-Karin [195] The archaeology of 19th century­ is it worth the effort? In Sweden there is increasing interest in the archaeology of 19th century crofts. However, since most archaeologists are convinced that necessary facts can be gained from historical documents, they are not inclined to excavate. Ignoring the role of archaeology in the study of 19th century remains will however influence what stories of the past that are told today and will be told tomorrow. That raises questions of which type of the cultural heritage that should be preserved and who are to decide.

Indeed, those kinds of decisions will influence both the society and individuals and needs to be addressed. Andolina, Darren (University of California, Davis) and Rebecca Gilbert (University of California, Davis) [57] Steatite Sourcing: Results from Multiple Source Locations in California Historically steatite has proven a difficult material to geochemically source. However, recent attempts to characterize steatite sources using INAA and LA-ICP-MS have shown promise. Our paper will present the results of the chemical analysis of multiple steatite sources collected from several regions of California including the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Inyo Mountains, and Southern California. These analyses were successful in distinguishing between steatite from these regions indicating the potential for answering questions related trade and exchange through time. Andrade, Agustín [95] see Ibarra, julio C. Andre, Clarissa [109] see Skinner, Anne Andrefsky, William (Washington State University) [22] Comparing Flake Tool Efficiency or What Won`t Whittle Wood? In past several decades lithic technological studies have sometimes linked unretouched flake tools to aspects of technological expediency. Recent investigations from several parts of the world suggest that unretouched tools may have been more effective in performing various tasks than retouched tools. This paper explores efficiency of retouched and unretouched flake tools from replicated and excavated assemblages. Results show unretouched flake tools are more efficient than retouched tools for certain tasks and that expediency of production may not be the primary reason for their use. Instead, these were the preferred tools when tool-stone abundance allowed for their production.

In contrast with patterns identified in other parts of Belize, our 2010 excavations and mapping activities suggest that Tipan was founded late and most likely experienced a relatively short large-scale occupation. In this presentation, issues of architectural form, function, chronology, and access to space are considered in an effort to better define Late-to-Terminal Classic period sociopolitical developments in this part of the southern Maya Lowlands.

Yet recent detailed technological analyses of lithic special deposits, royal burials, and raw material management reveal more complexity than traditional opposition of centralized vs. decentralized economy. Also specific lithic materials and distributions in some sites have very segmented production chains, perhaps suggesting central coordination. Yet other Maya sites have a completely different pattern. Here we briefly report new extensive analyses of lithic patterns at Cancuen, Copan, Calakmul and other sites in terms of control, variability, and change. [116] Second Organizer Andrushko, Valerie (Southern Connecticut State University) [233] Skeletal Evidence for Inca Warfare from Cuzco, Peru The osteological evidence for Inca warfare is addressed through the analysis of burials from 11 sites in the Cuzco region of Peru. In the Inca Imperial Period (AD 1400 ­ 1532), 18 individuals had warfare-related injuries to the cranium (8.2%, 18/219), consisting of large, complete, and/or perimortem fractures. This frequency was a significant rise from earlier time periods, when warfarerelated injuries were scarce (Middle Horizon, AD 600­ 1000, 2.8%, 1/36; Late Intermediate Period, AD 1000­ 1400, 2.5%, 5/199). These injuries were commonly seen at some Inca sites and absent at others, revealing significant geographical differences in the prevalence of warfare-related activities. Angelbeck, Bill (Independent) [232] An Indirect Historical Approach to Cultural Change: Considering Shifts in Societal Tensions throughout the Coast Salish Past The Direct Historical Approach has been used to understand past societies by extending ethnographically known practices to archaeological patterns. The approach has had success in regions of temporal continuity, but less so in areas marked by discontinuity, such as Euroamerican contact with the Northwest Coast. Discontinuities are not limits to understanding, however, but can be lenses for insights by revealing how societal tensions manifest and reorganize. Building upon Proudhon's characterization of society as not a monolithic whole but as a bundle of tensions, I apply an "indirect historical approach" to gauge changes in societal frictions throughout the Coast Salish past.

The Borax Lake Pattern within far northern California is thought to represent a generalized technological organization representing an upland foraging subsistence-settlement strategy with little variation between archaeological assemblages throughout the region. Current research has focused on this variation, as minimal as it may appear, to flesh out our understanding of human behavior during the early Holocene, revealing variability in technological organization in response to ecological conditions that is relevant to our understanding of the Borax Lake Pattern. Anovitz, Lawrence (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), Mostafa Fayek (University of Manitoba), David Cole (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) and Tristan Carter (McMaster University) [97] Analysis of Obsidian Hydration: The Current State of the Art In 1997 Anovitz et al. reported to the SAA the results of our initial attempts to understand the process of obsidian hydration using Secondary Ion mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) to directly analyze the concentration of water as a function of depth in archaeologically-hydrated obsidian, showing that the technique`s primary difficulty to that point was the inherent imprecision and inaccuracy of optical measurement. Subsequent analysis of both experimental and archaeological samples (Mexico and Turkey) has elucidated hydration mechanisms, shown that high-precision extrinsic dating is possible, and provided a new method for determining paleoclimatic data.

These lithic artifacts pertain to the Middle Preclassic through the Terminal Classic period and can serve as sensitive indicators for reconstructing one aspect of long-term changing patterns of the pre-Columbian Maya sociopolitical and economic systems in the study region. The results of my study suggest that importation of obsidian blade cores from highland Guatemala and local production of prismatic blades began during the Middle Preclassic period as the result of sociopolitical development at Ceibal.

We present a precise AMS 14C chronology, anchored on well-defined stratigraphic relationships between carbonized samples and cultural deposits. A Bayesian framework is used to interpret AMS 14C data from two groups in the site core and several settlements. By combining non-quantitative information with probability distributions, we discuss how these refined methods for chronology-building are shaping our understanding of the growth and decline of a Maya polity. Arakawa, Fumiyasu (Crow Canyon Archaeological Center) and Jamie Merewether (Crow Canyon Archaeological Center) [117] Evaluating Chaco Influences in the Central Mesa Verde Region Using Material Culture during the Chaco and Post-Chaco Periods Archaeologists have assumed that the frequency of interaction and trade between the people of the Mesa Verde region and those outside the region changed from an open, frequent interaction during the Chaco Phenomenon (AD 1060­1140) to a very limited exchange in the Post-Chaco period. To investigate this, we looked at trade items found in Chaco and Post Chaco deposits in the Mesa Verde, Totah, and Chaco regions. The data should support the assumption about frequent trade during the Chaco period or, alternatively, suggest that the Mesa Verde people were isolated, maintaining their own traditions from A.D. 1060 to 1280.

This paper present results from a research project carried out in the Andean highlands of Colombia which main purpose was to reconstruct the history of wood use as fuel for the pottery production since prehispanic times. In this paper we compare different fuel resources used for ceramic manufacturing in three moments: prehispanic, colonial and recent times. Several methodological strategies were carried out during the project. The project uses data from ethnoarchaeological research (fuel use) and charcoal analysis from archaeological middens. It will be discussed the value of these methodological strategies to understand past human relationships to their wood resources.

Kam Manahan (Kent State University) [221] The architectural and archaeological transition from Late Classic to Terminal Classic at Xuenkal, Yucatan, Mexico Recent excavations at the site of Xuenkal, Yucatan, demonstrate a long occupational sequence and architectural record, starting in the Late Preclassic. The most dramatic changes to this sequence are found in the transition from Late Classic to Terminal Classic periods. Occupants at the site participated in a regional tradition of core-veneer architecture during the Late Classic period, while during the Terminal Classic even elite architecture is constructed of reutilized materials constructed in a haphazard manner. Analyzed in concert with the artifactual transition, these architectural changes can be understood to reflect changes in the sociopolitical organization and economy of the region.

Areshian, Gregory (University of California) and Boris Gasparian (Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia) [114] Patterns Of Cave Occupation During The PreSubboreal Holocene Of The Caucasus And Central Near Eastern Highlands Post-Paleolithic cave occupation is little studied phenomenon in the Caucasus. From the Epipaleolithic to the formation of Maikop assemblages of the fourth millennium BCE caves were used in some areas as habitations of hunter-gatherers transitioning to foodproducing economies. Recent discoveries in Armenia suggest substantial variability in the Neolithic transition. Pre-pottery Neolithic cave site of Kmlo co-existed with agricultural open-air settlements. Discoveries at Areni-1 demonstrate that the growth of societal complexity during the Chalcolithic (fifth millennium BCE) led to a specialized usage of caves as ritual spaces by communities of farmers occupying open-air settlements.

and clothing of the humans buried--and their horses. In this presentation I use a relational and phenomenological approach to human-horse interactions to argue that the tattoos found on many of the human bodies have been misidentified as theriomorphs, and instead represent actual horses. I further discuss how these horses etched upon human skin reflect cosmological values and the passing of time for the Pazyryk people. Arguello Garcia, Pedro Maria (University of Pittsburgh) [260] Rock art and domestic ritual. A locational analysis of El Colegio petroglyphs, center of Colombia. The analysis of the distribution of both petroglyphs and households in El Colegio has permitted to evaluate some hypothesis about the rituality of rock art. In Colombia, rock art has generally been considered as a part of a very special ritual behavior, differentiated from the domestic sphere. Such explanations are the result of the consideration of rock art isolated from other archaeological objects and as a primary source of symbolic information. On the contrary, an archaeological attempt using several lines of evidence at different scales has provided a different picture in which rock art seems more related to domestic activities. Ariel, Frank [59] see Castro, Alicia S. Arksey, Marieka (British Museum) and Patrick Wilkinson (University of Arkansas) [208] Constructing Histories in Sixteenth Century Mesoamerica: Landscape, Resistance, and Identity This poster explores the concept of landscape as being fundamental to the creation and maintenance of an indigenous historical identity which was able to persist throughout the early colonial period in Western Mesoamerica. The lack of true writing`, as understood by the Europeans, meant that the indigenous writing systems were discounted. Different concepts of landscape, as evidenced within codices and maps, meant that their importance to the creation of indigenous peoples` identities went unrecognized. Understanding the roles that such concepts can offer conflict studies provides a fresh perspective on the ability of such studies to identify the indigenous perspective.

Preliminary interpretations are that this assemblage represents the latter stages of biface reduction in the manufacture of lithic and glass tools not necessarily associated with the processing of game. Rather, it is suggested that the assemblage represents tool making associated with ritual activity at the site by shwoonA-m (Indian doctors) in the 19th century and possibly earlier

Arnold, Dean (Wheaton College (IL)), Bruce Bohor (US Geological Survey, retired), Hector Neff (California State University Long Beach), Gary Feinman (Field Museum of Natural History) and Ryan Williams (Field Museum of Natural History) [142] Indigenous Knowledge and the Sources of Palygorskite used in Maya Blue Maya Blue was created from indigo and palygorskite, both part of Yucatec Maya indigenous knowledge. In the 1960's, Arnold and Bohor hypothesized that the palygorskite in Maya Blue came from two modern sources of the mineral. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 154 samples of palygorskite using LA-ICP-MS, and compared them with the analyses of Maya Blue (N = 9) from Chichén Itzá and Palenque. The palygorskite in these samples came from the two modern sources. This approach to Maya Blue demonstrates the value of combining indigenous knowledge, ethnohistory, archaeology, and the techniques of the physical sciences to answer archaeological questions.

Studies of climate and paleobotanical assemblages provide insights into the consequences of drought for Chumash settlement, health, plant harvests, and risk management­all germane to contemporary climate and food production issues. Major asphaltum seeps facilitated a transportation revolution a millennium ago (plank-boat construction); as today, petroleum products were noxious but prized resources.

Arnold, Shannon (University of Utah) [91] Estimated Population Density and Potential Crop Yields in Range Creek Canyon, Utah This study concentrates on estimating the population density of Range Creek Canyon, Utah, during the short Fremont occupation of the valley floor, approximately A.D. 900-1100. Two estimates will be made. First, the size and number of residential surface structures located on the valley floor will be used to estimate the maximum number of individuals living in the canyon. The second measure will examine the arable lands on the valley floor using area, slope, and distance to water to create a scale of agricultural potential under ideal growing conditions. The results will be developed through further excavation of suspected residential structures in the canyon, the collection of additional radio carbon dates, and isotopic analysis of potentially farmable areas identified in this study.

In recent centuries, the existence of a politically unified Germany has caused people to question whether there is a unified German identity. Through all of recorded history, the region now known as Germany housed a fractured and disparate people only loosely connected with one another. The present study will examine the Germanic peoples living in the area during the Migration Period (A.D. 400-600) and the early Middle Ages (A.D. 600-800), paying special attention to material culture and extant Old High German texts, in an attempt to define the influences of indigenous ideologies on these peoples` sense of identity.

The results of obsidian sourcing analysis can be used to reconstruct prehistoric mobility and trade patterns. Basalt sourcing analysis has the potential to reveal similar kinds of information about prehistoric people who relied on basalt in addition to, or instead of obsidian.

The core information comes from recent work at Naranjo in highland Guatemala, yielding data on the arrangement of the site`s Middle Preclassic site layout. The role of the plaza at the site has showed the importance of this ritual space. Information on the role of the plaza at Naranjo will be presented, showing the integration of its landscape as part of the site composition. The presence of three rows of monuments associated to the plaza, contributes to demonstrate the ritual use of such space. Comparisons with contemporary sites will be presented to place this architectural practice in perspective. Arsenault, Daniel (CELAT-UQAM, Montreal, Quebec)

[60] It`s a bird... it`s a plane... no, it`s a memekweshuat! Interpreting some peculiar figures in the Canadian Shield rock art. In the Canadian Shield rock art the human body is usually depicted with a minimum of details (no facial features, hands, feets) showing therefore a schematic figure with only basic traits (head, trunk, arms legs). However there are examples of human-like figures whose body features are more detailed. I argue that some of them could be interpreted as the representation of a peculiar species, the memekweshuat. Since there are tales in Algonquian oral traditions or ethnohistorical accounts describing them, these data can be used to discuss how and why such personages are represented in the rock art sites located in Québec. Artz, Joe (University of Iowa) [234] The Architecture of Ritual: the Creation of a RockCut Tomb at Bolores, Torres Vedras, Portugal Some 4,800 years ago, people chose a sandstone outcrop overlooking the Rio Sizandro as a burial place for the dead. The outcrop, a Jurassic deltaic stream channel, is conspicuous in the locality. The people carved an arched, sloped-ceiling rock shelter into the soft, easily worked sandstone, and excavated its floor into shale underlying the sandstone. During its two millennia of use, this ritual space was modified by further excavation into the shale, and by the slab construction of small chambers. Through microstratigraphic and geospatial analyses we are identifying and modeling the different phases in the site`s architectural history. [234] see Thies, Meagan E.

Asbury, Sophia (Washington State University) [257] Testing the Limits of Rim Sherd Measurement Archaeological investigations utilizing ceramic materials are often handicapped by fragmentation in ceramic assemblages. This study seeks to determine the operational limits on the use of rim sherds to extrapolate orifice size. The correlation between orifice diameter and vessel size makes rim sherds particularly useful, however the researcher`s ability to accurately project vessel diameter from a rim sherd may be impacted by sherd size. The percentage of the total circumference (or degree of arc) that is needed in order to obtain accurate diameter projections is tested. Additionally, given the objective nature of this measure, replicability between researchers will also be addressed.

Atalay, Sonya (Indiana University) [197] Engaging Archaeology: Positivism, objectivity and rigor in activist archaeology Any attempt to make the case for activist scholarship runs directly up against objections, encapsulated in three powerful words: positivism, objectivity and rigor. In his edited volume on activist scholarship, Charles Hale asks scholars to consider these three common objections to activist research. This paper critically assesses these objections in relation to activist archaeology. I consider the feasibility of engaging in activist research while still maintaining a level of objectivity and rigor. Must we sacrifice objectivity and rigor in doing activist archaeology? If so, what are the implications for archaeologists who are committed to applied and actionoriented research? [78] Discussant Athens, J. [73] Archaeology of Northern Highland Ecuador Before the Inka: Chronology and Processual Implications A synthesis of archaeological and paleoenvironmental findings provides the foundation for a chronology of the pre-Inka archaeology of the highland region of northern Pichincha and Imbabura Provinces of Ecuador. Evidence

for a preceramic occupation is unclear, but beginning with the introduction of maize agriculture, the natural inter-Andean landscape was transformed into an entirely managed anthropogenic ecosystem. It culminated in the rise of hierarchical social systems with major monumental constructions. Findings having implications for socio-politico processes are highlighted. Atici, Levent (University of Nevada, Las Vegas) [69] Zooarchaeology at Körtik Tepe, SE Turkey: Preliminary Results on Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) Subsistence Southeastern Turkey is now considered part of the archaeological domain where the Neolithic Revolution took place independently. The recent archaeological projects in the region have greatly contributed to a better understanding of Terminal Pleistocene/Early Holocene archaeology. Thus, it is crucial to develop a fineresolution picture of hunter-gatherer behavioral strategies and changes therein during this period of rapid cultural and environmental change in southeastern Anatolia. Körtik Tepe near Batman is one of the PPNA (10th millennium BP) sites with astonishing findings. This paper presents the preliminary results of the faunal analysis from Körtik Tepe and focuses on the animal exploitation strategies. [216] see Kansa, Sarah W.

Furthermore, the presence of non-local material--spondylus, cinnabar, obsidian--demonstrates a long-distance exchange network operating from 1200 ­ 400 B.C., coinciding with the peak and decline of the Chavín phenomenon. The Fortaleza Valley was an important route from the coast to the highlands near Chavín, and Huaricanga`s location probably afforded the local population access to exchange networks operating throughout the Central Andes. We discuss the significance of these exchange dynamics for understanding the social processes operating at Huaricanga. Avery, George [64] see Hargrave, Michael L. Awe, Jaime J.

The production and distribution of prestige goods were the prerogatives of elite groups in Andean polities, and through this medium elites expressed their social identity, ideology and authority resulting in a powerful media. Presence, absence and exchange of ceramic attributes allow us to explore identity struggles arising after Inca imperial dominance, and unveil the strategies employed in the conquest of the Asia Valley, Peru. I examine a ceramic sample from the site of Uquira, and consider the consequences of the new political conditions imposed by the Incas on the local population of the Asia Valley. Bachand, Bruce R.

Although it was criticized at the time of its publication, the study refined the classificatory scheme and style areas that continue to frame most California rock art studies today. This paper revisits Heizer and Clewlow`s study and the reactions it sparked in the archaeological and rock art communities, and uses recent data from sites in southern California to assess criticisms of their methods, results and interpretations. Backo, Heather (Tulane University) [156] Huaca de la Luna Plaza 3A and the Taphonomy of Human Sacrifice This paper explores and compares a combination of newer and traditional taphonomic techniques designed to interpret sample size, patterns of disarticulation and trauma, contextual data, and orientation to explore the type and level of postmortem alterations among a group of 100+ sacrificed individuals from Plaza 3A, located at the Moche site of Huaca de la Luna. Unusual patterns of element representation, disarticulation and dispersal, and grouping/positioning can then be illustrated and compared to known patterns of taphonomic activity, which are then either confirmed or excluded. In addition, it will be shown how these techniques can give insight into the level of taphonomic winnowing present in a site.

New Data from Middle Chevelon Creek (Arizona) The Mogollon Region Small Sites (MRSS) project carried out systematic survey and excavation of Late Archaic through Pueblo I farming hamlets in the middle Chevelon Creek drainage. Analysis of charcoal from excavated

domestic structures at the Chevelon Crossing site allows us to reconstruct the prehistoric vegetation along Chevelon creek. The taxonomic variability observed indicates the presence of diverse vegetation communities. The most important of these were pine and juniper woodland, and a riparian community with willow, poplar, and maple among the arboreal taxa. Taphonomic study of the charcoal assemblage also provides information about post-depositional events at the site. Badam, Gyani (Delhi Institute of Heritage Research & Management) [12] Ratite and Human Interaction Symposium One of the landmark discoveries made in Indian archaeology has been of ostrich egg shell pieces, reported from various Upper Palaeolithic levels of more than 70 sites. These have been studied in detail from phylogenetic, biochemical, ecological and chronological points of view. Some shell pieces are engraved and some have cross hatched designs on them, constituting the earliest datable evidence of applied art in India. The ostriches also had several breeding centers in India. However, the presence of this bird in the form of pictographs in various rock shelters is rather debatable.

I examine these assumptions by analyzing settlements, households, and subsistence patterns. The Taehwa basin lost its peripheral status and was gradually integrated into the material cultural mainstream of South-central and Western Korea in the latter half of the Middle Mumun Period (850-700 BC), and local agents may have played an active role in the domestication of crops such as soybean.

From the banks of the Colorado River to the high elevations of the North Rim, the canyon is a place of emergence, home, refuge and return. Thousands of people lived within the canyon, leaving behind the footprints of their passing in thousands of archaeological sites. Preservation of these resources and their information is core to our stewardship responsibilities. For over 100 years, archaeologists have documented these places in hopes of better understanding the dynamic nature of human use and occupation of the marginal canyon environment.

Rather, it was a commonly dispersed attribute of human-nonhuman social fields that might be transferred, gathered, embodied, or emplaced. Thus, political power was realized, at least in part, through socio-religious practices involving ancestors, elements, and otherworldly forces. Deconstructing the dichotomy of religion and politics, we focus on practices of material manipulation, burning and burial at and around the 11th and 12th century complex of Cahokia along the Mississippi River. Specifically, we detail a number of contexts where temple buildings, human remains, and marker posts were transubstantiated, especially through burning, and hence their power transformed. Persons were constructed, places of power were built, political agents were defined, and enemies were eliminated through fire and earth. Balzotti, Chris [225] see Terry, Richard E.

[92] Lime Technology And The Mesoamerican Cultures Lime is a very important technological discovery for Mesoamerica. This material implies a substantial change in preindustrial technology that involved large quantities of energy and sophisticated social organization. Lime mortars allowed over the years to build thin walls and even vaults. They also favored the urbanization process by providing hygienic surfaces and preventing plagues and epidemics. In addition, lime made it possible to get the maximum energy out of the corn crops through the lime processing, the nixtamalization. This paper shows recent developments in the study of ancient lime technology, calling attention to this valuable product.

In Mesoamerica, where the provisioning of highland cities with coastal resources was an important factor in the development and expansion of complex societies, identifying highland-lowland transportation corridors has proven to be a fruitful avenue of research. However, GIS has not been widely used to consider the costs and advantages of maritime, interestuarine, and land-based coastal trade. In this paper, we present a least-cost analysis of land and water-based transportation routes along the Pacific Coast of Mexico. [215] First Chair Barber, Sarah [5] see Brzezinski, Jeffrey S.

Reframing questions in terms of practice moves analysis beyond solely that of materials themselves. Recognizing that different opportunities and choices existed for social actors in pluralistic settings, I explore construction of Native American social identity using ceramic, lithic, and macrobotanical data from the Late Prehistoric Lamb site in the Central Illinois River Valley. Such archaeological materials point to people in the past--procuring, processing, preparing, serving, consuming--in essence, creating communities of practice.

Variation in vertebrate consumption patterns may help to track social differentiation and changing elite occupation.

Barker, Alex (University of Missouri) [53] Is More Enough? Population, Resources and the Problem of Sufficiency: Three Cases from the Southeastern US The rise of sociopolitical elites generally assumes control and command of surplus production.

Three case studies from the American Southeast are considered to explore the relationships between scale, sufficiency and surplus in prestate hierarchical societies, and to illuminate the different ways these notions are employed both in prehistory and by prehistorians.

Following recovery of the buried sample, each bowl was cut into a series of vertical transects. These transects were distributed to

To help fill this gap, I am conducting attribute and compositional analyses on the ceramics from Pueblo Alamo (LA 8), a 13th century site in the Santa Fe/Galisteo Basin area, New Mexico. By examining the relationship between technological style and design style, a better understanding of 13th century ceramics may be gained, as well as insight into the social identity and interaction with other regions.

[28] Classic Maya Deity Categories Much has been written about Classic Maya (AD 250-900) religious practices. Part of this scholarship has been devoted to the identification of deities and to their enduring nature through time and across space. Other scholars have observed a wide variety of Classic period deities and their local nature. This paper uses evidence from Classic Maya inscriptions to demonstrate that universal and local are in fact two distinct categories of deity recognized by the Maya themselves. Rituals devoted to their veneration were distinct, as was vocabulary used to describe them. This has broad implications for our understanding of Maya religious practice.

Barrett, Jason (Texas A&M University) [116] Social Adaptations to Critical Resource Availability, Control, Exploitation, and Depletion among the Lowland Maya The distribution of tool-stone varied considerably across lowland Maya landscapes and regions, with sites occupying different positions along a continuum of resource availability. Control over this critical economic resource functioned as a finance mechanism for political elites in northwestern Belize, who administered stone tool production. However, tool-stone is not a renewable resource and intensive export-oriented production eventually led to widespread resource depletion. Resource stress reached its apex during the Late Classic period, and conservation measures became increasingly employed. Much of the region was abandoned during the Terminal Classic, and critical resource depletion is likely to have been a contributing factor.

Using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data derived from human bone collagen and carbon isotopes of bone apatite (n=198), we evaluate the relative importance of marine and terrestrial resources to the diet. The results indicate that the CCO-548 population primarily consumed terrestrial and freshwater resources, with a small input of marine resources from the San Francisco Bay Estuary. Bartelink, Eric J.

I suggest that the cultural meanings of particular places were manipulated through the physical modification of things and material forms --forms that structured movement, limited access, changed environmental conditions, and altered perceptions. These forms were not unidirectionally built by people, however, but also built by dynamic environmental constituents that contributed to their uses, maintenance, and social histories.

At many sites, the uppermost stratum is already severely impacted by farming, timbering, grazing, and earlier military activities. Intact deposits may remain in features that extend into deeper, undisturbed strata. Ongoing research is developing a method to identify the onset and quantify the extent of new disturbance based on changes in soil mechanical properties, organic matter, and chemical elements at the A/B or A/E interface. Initial results from Fort Benning suggest that metals such as Cr, Cu, Pb, and Zn, which are relatively immobile, may be useful indicators.

Stable isotope analysis of human bone aims to recover in vivo signatures from prehistoric people. Recent isotopic results from CA-CCO-548, a mid-to-late Holocene site (ca. 4000-3000 B.P.) located along Marsh Creek in Contra Costa County will be a case study for comparing differences in burial preservation. Using standard diagenesis indicators from analysis of human bone collagen and apatite (n=242), the results indicate the possibilities of using geoarchaeology as an additional prescreening tool to select viable isotope samples.

Beck, Charlotte (Hamilton College) and George Jones (Hamilton College) [94] Moving into the Mid-Holocene: The Paleoarchaic/Archaic Transition in the Intermountain West In most of North America the transition from Paleoindian technology to that known as Archaic appears gradual, especially with respect to point technology. In the East, for example, fluting continues after Clovis with Cumberland, Simpson, and Dalto, while notching seems to evolve through the waisting` of earlier forms. In the Intermountain West, however, this transition is more abrupt: stemmed forms, which are at least coeval with Clovis elsewhere, persist unchanged for about 4,000 years and then disappear along with other distinctive components of the toolkit. Here we explore possible explanations for such an abrupt technological change in this region. Beck, Charlotte [262] see Jones, George T. Beck, Margaret [187] see Abbott, David R. Beck, R.

Beck, Robin (University of Michigan) [86] Making Communities of Aggregations in the Formative Lake Titicaca Basin One of the greatest challenges to any new form of community is to balance the need for common identities with the need for recognizing the distinctions among diverse constituencies. The built environment offers an important medium for materializing these dual challenges in the context of a recently aggregated population. In Bolivia`s Lake Titicaca Basin, Middle Formative villagers (800-250 BC) built platform complexes that visually dominated everyday life in their respective communities. These complexes simultaneously anchored villagers to a common identity while legitimizing asymmetric relations among kin-based constituencies. This forging of identity and difference was essential for making communities of aggregations.

The control and distribution of labor is an essential topic for understanding the character and development in prehistoric state formation.

Visibility graph analysis demonstrated that the built environment of Pueblo Shé, New Mexico (A.D. 1325-1600) controlled social encounter through the development of a plaza and entranceway system. Visually connected areas afforded opportunities for potential social encounter. Small plazas with limited intervisibility to other areas created private spaces to promote social bonding in subsections of the population. While large and highly visually connected plazas provided public space for community wide ceremonial performances. Beeker, Charles [69] see Conrad, Geoffrey W. [260] see Foster, John W.

These interpretations date from the 1960s when the imagery had little archaeological context. The earliest interpretations of the artwork in the 1940s are more consistent with current archaeological data. Bodily decoration makes reference to Mesoamerican concepts of rulership and its basis in control over nature, and identifies both males and females as holders of diverse positions in a system of diffuse legitimate political authority.

The archaeological landscape consists of a rather continuous, low density artifactual distribution where the highest peaks in density are associated to lagoons. Besides, the high frequency of hunting blinds (parapetos) together with their size, shape, topographic locations and lithic assemblages suggest different guanaco hunting tactics. The archaeology of the plateaus highlights the other side of the coin represented by the lower basins.

They bear characteristics which distinguish them from contemporaneous assemblages known from western Eurasia, though they exhibit common Upper Palaeolithic traits, such as an overall rise in the bladey/bladelet component. Though the reduction sequences employed are known elsewhere, their chronological association differs, indicating an independent local evolution, influenced most probably by ideas and concepts that derived from outside the region, but are firmly incorporated within the matrix of local tradition.

A variety of sites are re-examined to refine a Cuzco-Inka style of mortuary treatment, which is used to compare and contrast with that of subject populations.

As a result most enclosures belong to the Uighur period. Only few belong to the time of the Mongol World Empire.

Soil samples were taken from every 50cm quadrant across the house and tunnel floors, which in turn were analyzed for pH and for carbon and nitrogen isotopic concentration. Spatial analysis of these values yielded distinct inter- and intra- house variations, which may provide insight into whether the journey from Alaska to Greenland facilitated a change in how Thule people organized and used their interior spaces.

However, biodistance analysis cannot reject the hypothesis that some female retainers were wives. Detailed and careful consideration of the retainer concept is warranted highlighting relationships between sacrifice, gender, kinship, and mortuary patterns in ancient Peru.

Within AP-SIM, household agents make decisions about farming and herding strategies, based upon their surrounding landscape.

Traditional commentaries describe God L as an underworld dweller living deep within the earth. In contrast, this paper re-defines God L`s realm as a borderland of earth and sky.

Bernbeck, Reinhard (Freie Universitaet Berlin) [122] From Archaeological Knowledge to Narratives without Subjects Some basic elements of archaeological knowledge are its fragmentary nature, lack of insight into acting characters and their motivations, and the impossibility of giving names to most of those whose material remains we explore. Past people remain in a haze. In contrast, archaeological texts are overloaded with details on form, color, hardness, and other qualities of materials. I argue that the French literary form of the nouveau roman provides useful guidelines for the construction of narratives that do justice to subjects in the past. "Doing justice" means resisting the temptation to colonize the past with the subjects of our imagination.

Swamp: Extracting Ourselves and Meaning from the Clay-rich Sediments Over 30 years ago, Peter Harrison and B.L. Turner conducted seminal research on the settlements adjoining Pulltrouser Swamp and the raised fields that they argued were constructed and used for agriculture by ancient Maya people. Fifteen years ago that stance was challenged by researchers who maintained that these fields were natural formations that may, at most, have been casually modified early and later abandoned due to rising water levels and uplift from gypsum precipitation. To resolve this issue, the K`axob Wetlands Project has examined artifacts, ecofacts, and microstratigraphic thinsections from the region. This paper presents our findings and conclusions. Berryman, Judy [115] see Stone, Suzanne Bertrando, Ethan (Cuesta College/California Army National Guard) [150] Culture as Constraint on Costly Signaling Theory: Gender Roles and Social Stratification Influencing Show-Off Behavior and the Archaeological Record in Central California. Efforts to explain prehistoric shifts in hunting behavior identified in the Great Basin and California have stimulated a vigorous debate on the application and archaeological interpretation of Costly Signaling Theory. Increases in big game identified in the archaeological record of the Late Holocene have been viewed as male Show-Off behavior to improve male Darwinian fitness. Alternate views suggest intensification or climate change may be responsible for this pattern. In this study, anthropologically inferred gender roles and social stratification are considered to explain clearly divergent hunting patterns in the Late Holocene of Central California.

The pre-bow pattern is characterized by short-term occupations connected with large game hunting. The more intensive post-bow pattern features villages with well-built houses and midden deposits as rich, and milling assemblages as extensive, as any found on the adjacent valley floor. White Mountain alpine villages and valley floor villages developed simultaneously in response to population growth that diminished opportunities for mobility. Both changes are likely connected with the late prehistoric spread of Numic speaking peoples across the Great Basin.

ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 76TH ANNUAL MEETING

Northern Coast Salish peoples did not have access to major rivers equal in size and resources to the Fraser. As such, their existence within and use of the landscape differs in important respects from the southern Coast Salish. Through survey and excavations within Shíshálh traditional territory, we compare patterns of land use within our study area and with the wider Salish Sea region. We present a detailed study of human existence within a landscape not dominated by a major salmon run, and consider how this affects our understanding of the culture/ecology paradigm embedded in the Gulf of Georgia cultural sequence. Bingham, Paul (Stony Brook University) and Joanne Souza (Stony Brook University) [43] The Unique Power of the North American Record Allows Tests of a New Theory of Social Evolution The archaeological record reveals dramatic local increases in social complexity ranging from the agricultural Anasazi to the non-agricultural Chumash. Our new theory of human evolution and history (2008, JTheoretBiol. 253, 261; 2009, Death from a Distance and the Birth of a Humane Universe) predicts that all social revolutions result from increases in social scale, produced, in turn, by new coercive technologies permitting enlarged scale of control of conflicts of interest. Remarkably, the bow`s arrival in North America precedes diverse local social revolutions precisely as predicted. We will review evidence for this strong claim and its crucial, general implications for archaeology. Binning, Jeanne (California Department of Transportation) and Alan P. Garfinkel (AECOM) [231] The Manifestation of Clovis in the Far Western United States: An Example from Inyo County, California There are two questions every researcher asks of Clovis data from the Far Western, continental United States: 1.) Are Clovis points from the Far West within the morphological range of Clovis points from other parts of the continental United States? 2.) Are Clovis points from the Far West contemporaneous with the narrow time period within which Clovis lifeways have been established in the Southwestern, Midwestern and Eastern United States? An obsidian Clovis point from Inyo County, California provides an opportunity to address these questions. Birch, Jennifer (University of Georgia) [86] Settlement Aggregation and Social Transformation: Negotiating community in the context of coalescence At various times and places throughout the globe, dispersed populations coalesced, coming together into increasingly large and complex social aggregates. While many studies of settlement aggregation have focused on the regional level, the actual mechanisms for the development and maintenance of new social formations developed within individual communities. How do we reconcile community-level processes and contingencies with regional perspectives on settlement aggregation? This paper will introduce some of the overarching themes of this session and introduce an example from eastern North America that provides new insights into the social transformations which occurred within local populations in the context of coalescence.

Bird, Rebecca (Stanford University), Douglas Bird (Stanford University) and Brian Codding (Stanford University) [192] Foraging with Fire: identifying anthropogenic fire regimes in Western Australia In Western Australia, Martu frequently use fire while foraging. We show that Martu burning functions to increase immediate hunting returns with sand monitor lizards, but also has some epiphenomenal benefits. Both of these hinge on differences in scale between human and lightning caused fires. Human fires occur at a scale characteristic to human foraging. The resulting successional mosaic is more diverse than a lighting mosaic at the human scale, but is indistinguishable at larger scales. As such, attempts to indentify differences in human vs. lightning fires in the past will require methods capable of operating at this characteristic human scale. Biro, Peter (Abteilung fur Altamerikanistik) [221] A New Epigraphic Interpretation of Terminal Classic Northern Maya Lowlands History Andrews and Robles Castellanos (1985) proposed an interpretation of Terminal Classic Northern Maya lowlands suggesting that ethnic Itza invaded the area and occupied Chichen Itza, creating a stand-off between Puuc Maya and Coba territories. Northern city collapses were directly connected to this invasion, and Coba was abandoned due to attacks and isolation around AD 1100. Using new epigraphic data, I suggest Coba was abandoned in the early 800s and there is no evidence of occupation, attack, or any Chichen Itza-related activity, contrary to Andrews and Robles. Instead, I propose a new Terminal Classic history based on epigraphic and colonial data.

Both Aztec and Postconquest maize-grinding used gracile manos. These lightweight artifacts sharply differentiate later collections from more robust, earlier grinding equipment and probably reflect a greater intensity of maize preparation. On the other hand, Postconquest tools are less diverse in form. This change may reflect both changes in grinding tool production and a decrease in the variety of alternative foods in use in Postconquest times.

Paleobotanical and faunal data from the Midsouth and lower Midwest suggest that Middle Archaic foragers focused intensely on a relatively few major plant and animal resources. In that area, the Mid-Holocene was marked by warmer, drier conditions associated with the Hypsithermal Interval, which has in some cases been suggested as a period of resource stress. Substantial contraction of diet breadth during the peak of the Hypsithermal runs counter to such arguments. Evidence for increasing social complexity in this region during the late Middle Archaic may reflect the effects of high resource abundance during, rather than after, the Hypsithermal Interval.

On the one hand, many scholars continue to identify prehistoric forms of shamanism, claiming to have found examples across the ancient world of what Mircea Eliade called techniques of ecstasy. However, other scholars have denounced the application of the shamanism label to cultures outside of the concept`s original Siberian and Central Asian context. With reference to the cultural remains of the ancient Maya, this paper analyzes how archaeological, iconographic, and ethnohistoric instances of iron-ore artifacts termed mirrors are most effectively interpreted as evidence for shamanistic practices in ancient Maya society.

The use of geochemical soil analyses has a long history in archaeological site prospection, and the multi-element analysis of archaeological soils to identify activity areas is becoming increasingly common. Here, we combine both approaches to conduct a multi-scalar, multi-elemental analysis of site structure and feature function at the Native village of 17th century Mission Santa Catalina (Georgia). Using systematically collected soil samples analyzed by x-ray fluorescence spectrometry, we make inferences about settlement structure and identify specific activity areas, integrating our results with previously collected geophysical survey data.

[80] The Alamo Dam Area: A Lithic Procurement Landscape in West Central Arizona The Alamo Dam area of west central Arizona is often characterized as peripheral to the major cultural groups associated with prehistoric habitation of Arizona. Research in this region has identified numerous sites consisting of low-density lithic scatters and seldom evidence of prolonged use or habitation. SRI `s recent 3000 acre survey, supported by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ARRA funding, resulted in recordation of 37 additional lithic scatters located primarily in bajada settings. We examine these lithic scatters in a regional land-use framework and the aboriginal use of locally ubiquitous lithic raw materials in the Alamo Dam region. Blake, Michael (University of British Columbia) [232] Modeling Territories along the Northern Shores of the Salish Sea The ways in which people travel on both land and sea have long been recognized as a key factors in determining how territories are defined and used. Territoriality in the Coast Salish region was highly structured by both the modes of movement and the distinctive attributes of the landscape and seascape. I propose a model of Coast Salish territoriality that incorporates the technology of transportation on water and on land to show how this unique set of social, technological, and environmental factors contributed, paradoxically, to both intensive interaction and to sustained regionalism among the peoples of the Salish Sea.

Blakeslee, Donald (Wichita State University) [7] Capturing Process: Stacked Outline Analysis in Lithic Studies Archaeologists analyzing chipped stone tool assemblages deal with the products of a series of processes: wear, resharpening, breakage, repair, recycling and so on. In this paper, I present a technique that captures shape data exclusively, while allowing all of the items in an assemblage to be viewed simultaneously rather than sequentially as the eye moves from one item to the next. This allows visualization of the fundamental processes involved in making and using stone tools and allows testing of the (necessarily) extensive definitions of the analytical classes we create. Elaborations of the basic technique allow other forms of analysis.

Wolcott Toll (NM Archaeology) and Steve Lakatos (NM Archaeology) [37] The Galisteo Basin and the Perception of the Classic Period in the Northern Rio Grande Perception of the Classic period in the Galisteo Basin has both reflected and shaped our models of Puebloan history. Pueblos with 100s to 1000s of rooms, dominance of maize subsistence, and katsina religious institutions are reflected in plaza pueblos, rock art, and pottery traditions. This Classic manifestation is seen as the transition from the tumult of Pueblo migrations to the peoples encountered by the Spanish and anthropologists. The detailed historical narrative is far more interesting, within a strong rhythm of adaptation to climate change, intraregional population movement, complicated patterns of settlement aggregation, and underlying ethnolinguistic diversity. Bloch, Lindsay (UNC-Chapel Hill) [207] Trends in Redware Use and Production in the Chesapeake Coarse earthenwares, exemplified by redwares, are nearly ubiquitous on historic sites of the seventeenth to mid-nineteenth century. The limited range of forms and glazes, coupled with abundant manufacturing sites in the Chesapeake and beyond leaves the provenience of these wares often uncertain. Through comparative analysis of domestic site assemblages across the region, spatial patterning in the attributes of these wares emerge. These patterns signal distinct uses and possibly distinct production origins for piedmont and coastal assemblages. Tracing networks from producer to consumer allows consideration of the social and economic relationships of American craftspersons within their communities and beyond. Blong, John (Texas A&M University) [181] Prehistoric Upland Use in the Central Alaska Range Current research into Central Alaskan lithic assemblage variability centers on landscape use to explain the decision to use inset microblade versus bifacial lithic technology. Critical to this research is balancing the depth of knowledge from lowland archaeological sites with evidence from the uplands. In summer 2010 we conducted archaeological survey in the Savage and Susitna River drainages in the uplands of the central Alaska Range to document prehistoric land use from earliest human occupation to less than 1,000 years ago. This data will inform hypotheses of landscape use and lithic assemblage variability in the region. Blustain, Jonah (University of Nevada, Reno) [208] Down from on High: Archaeological Investigations of Cornish Row`s Industrial Landscape, Virginia City, NV. Initial survey of the slopes of Mount Davidson near Virginia City, Nevada revealed a series of abandoned platforms alongside historic Howard Street. The platforms comprised part of what was historically an ethnically Cornish neighborhood that existed between c.1865 and c.1885. The Cornish miners were integral to the extraction of the Comstock ore due to their

knowledge of hardrock mining techniques. Test units were inserted on the platforms to determine how these spaces were used and by what means they were constructed. The excavation in conjunction with historical data will provide vital information regarding the construction of the Comstock`s industrial landscape. Blustain, Malinda (Robert S.

The first model states populations congregate around prestigious and wealthy families (Drennan 1987). The second states that a few individuals appropriate and control basic resources such as land, labor, or water (Earle 1991, Gilman 1991). This analysis contributes to the evaluation of models explaining the emergence of early communities and development of social complexity. Bocherens, Herve [205] see Julien, Marie-Anne Bocinsky, R.

Excavations of the site below the roadbed of USH 151 yielded a faunal assemblage of over 12,000 elements. The faunal assemblage suggests a diverse diet of terrestrial mammals including elk, deer, bear, raccoon, beaver, porcupine, rabbit, squirrel, chipmunk and canids as well as fish, water birds, reptiles, amphibians and freshwater mollusks. Bison elements, sometimes found in Eastern Oneota assemblages, are not present but the high reliance on fish is typical of most excavated Oneota faunal assemblages [104] see Boczkiewicz, Roberta Boehm, Andrew (Southern Methodist University) [6] Experimental Bison Butchery: A New Mexico Study This study documents the butchery of an American bison as part of an on-going effort to examine the range of human variation in butchery practices.

To be comparable with data from previous studies, all portions of the animal were weighed and measured and the time required to butcher particular elements was recorded. This study also reports the correlation between tool strokes and cut marks to evaluate previous experimental conclusions regarding processing intensity.

Eolian processes can expose and rebury archaeological remains rapidly, and identifying portions of sites still buried within sandsheets that are likely to yield additional significant data has sometimes relied on destructive mechanical processes.

Bohor, Bruce [142] see Arnold, Dean E. Bolender, Douglas (Kenyon College) [198] The production of intra- and inter-household surplus in Viking Age political economies The Viking Age settlement of Iceland fractured political structures as early colonists claimed individual household properties. During the initial settlement, production strategies were based on complex stratified households consisting of landowning families with dependent laborers and slaves. While inequality within the household could be profound there was relatively little institutionalized hierarchy among households. As population rose and the landscape filled in with additional farms significant inter-household stratification emerged. This paper compares the political context of surplus production for consumption within the household to surplus production for consumption outside the household, primarily as rents between landlords and tenants.

The discipline becomes both a search for archaeological information in the traditional sense and a search for answers about the self. This trend contrasts the idea of performing archaeology as an act of preserving a cultural past. Rather, it is the active creation of a new identity.

We use archaeological records of maritime hunting, fishing, and gathering at Otter Point, with 13 discrete components dated between ~7300 years ago and AD 1820, to investigate the long-term ecological history of shellfish, finfish, and sea mammal use on San Miguel Island. Although there is some continuity in prey species through time, human exploitation resulted in significant temporal fluctuations in the average size of shellfish and changes in the relative abundances of shellfish, fish, and sea mammals.

The case of the Iron Gates Mesolithic Stable isotopes are used routinely to reconstruct ancient diets. Analysis of human remains from sites in the Iron Gates (SE Europe) has led to conflicting interpretations of Mesolithic diets. One view (Radiocarbon 2004) is that diets were based on riverine resources throughout the Mesolithic. A competing hypothesis (J Arch Sci 2010) argues that Mesolithic diets were more varied, with the emphasis on terrestrial resources in the Early Mesolithic, and riverine resources only becoming important in the Later Mesolithic. Our paper revisits this issue, discussing the stable isotopic data in relation to archaeozoological, osteoarchaeological and radiocarbon evidence.

The archaeofauna comprises mainly mammal and fish remains. Fishes are nearshore species, dominated by pricklebacks and surfperches, with significant numbers of rockfishes. The assemblage also includes small schooling fishes, greenlings, sculpins, and salmonids. Taxa reflect exploitation of sandy beach and rocky intertidal zones. Mammal specimens are mainly mule deer-sized ruminants and smaller mammals, with a small representation of carnivores, including rare northern fur seal. The low representation of birds at Quiroste contrasts with that of earlier and contemporaneous assemblages from the region, suggesting cultural selectivity.

Ethiopia A second season of analyzing > 6000 lithics from Mezber, NE Ethiopia has expanded our knowledge of Pre-Aksumite technological/social organization. Local, possibly specialized knappers obtained obsidian (50%) and other raw materials from near-distant sources, possibly through/for trade. LSA-like assemblages, absent of foreign influence, were produced from prepared and unprepared blade/flake, radial, and bipolar cores via direct and indirect percussion. Functional and activity differences are suggested by raw materialspecific types and lithic variability between architectural units. We conclude with discussing the role of lithics in shaping Pre-Aksumite community activities/relations and early state formation in N. Ethiopia/Eritrea during the 1st millennium B.C.E.

George Quimby tested the site in 1937 and Grand Valley State University returned in 2006 to reexamine the site. Results from this research, including mapping and excavation data, suggested minimal disturbance and the possibility of subsurface features. To explore this possibility, both GPR and magnetometer surveys were done at the site in 2010, making it possible to test several hypotheses about the site structure and function generated by earlier fieldwork.

Obsidian in the Classic to Postclassic Periods Obsidian or volcanic glass was subject to widespread circulation in ancient Mesoamerica. Yet there is little evidence that Maya elites sought direct control of outcrops and quarry sites. Thus, elite control of this important resource either: (1) did not exist; (2) was manifested in some other aspect of the means of production; or (3) involved distribution rather production. This paper seeks to examine important changes in the production and distribution of obsidian as that material became commodified during the Classic to Postclassic periods.

Manufacturing characteristics, examined through petrography and macroscopic observations, suggest that certain raw materials held symbolic value; that pottery and pipe production were very differently organized; and that these differing modes of production shed light upon broader social changes that had occurred by the beginning of the late Woodland Period. In particular, this paper explores what the production of smoking pipes might tell us about changes to religious and shamanistic practices. Braun, Matthew [162] see Wescott, Konnie Bray, Tamara (Wayne State University) [24] Huacas, Ritual Commensality, and the Imperial Inca Agenda: Non-Human Persons as Political Agents in the Pre-Columbian Andes The late pre-Columbian landscape comprised a multitude of cultural and natural features classified as huaca. Native peoples regarded these phenomena as both animate and powerful. This paper considers how huacas were socially constituted and engaged, and how they figured in the political agenda of Tawantinsuyu. The theoretical approach adopted recognizes the significance of commensality in the construction of social relations, advances the notion of material agency, and allows for the idea of other-than-human persons as relevant social actors. The manner of Inca engagement with different huacas suggests their importance as political allies and the role they played in materializing the imperial agenda.

Prior inventories in McCain Valley documented widespread Late Prehistoric occupation, particularly during the last 1,000 years. While several important prehistoric sites and ethnohistoric villages are known for the broader region, the character of settlement and subsistence shifts in the region remains a focus of current research.

Useful species accounted for about 38% of the species and individuals, indicating that the forest is rich in useful trees but is not dominated by them. Species composition varied with both topography and land use, making it difficult to determine the extent to which environment versus ancient cultivation explain current distributions. We outline a plan to resolve this conundrum at the landscape level.

Toward an understanding of networks During the Xiongnu period Elite burials form a homogeneous group regarding their construction and furnishing, including numerous foreign artifacts which document far-reaching contacts. In this paper the relationship of the Elite to the local communities is explored as well as the connections of the Elite along the Eurasian Steppe Belt. The intensive communication leads to similar models of self-representation in the Western and Eastern Eurasian Steppe during the centuries around the turn of the era. Models for explaining the nature of the contacts, which are visible in the archaeological record are discussed. Broughton, Jack (University of Utah), R. Kelly Beck (University of Utah), Dennis H.

A Test Using Ancient DNA and Implications for Prehistory and Resource Management Recent research has documented numerous cases of prehistoric resource depression from standard zooarchaeological data. However, standard measures of prey population trends may not reflect broad-scale population declines, but rather the movement of prey away from densely settled human populations. More refined methods capable of measuring population-level trends in prey populations are thus warranted. We summarize such a method here that is based on temporal trends in genetic diversity derived from the DNA in archaeological faunas and provide preliminary data on genetic diversity from a pilot study involving elk from the San Francisco Bay area Brouwer, Marieka (Michigan State University) [108] Simulating Early Holocene Hunter-Gatherer Land Use Strategies in the Netherlands Predictive modeling is often used to generate hypotheses and expectations, and identify landscapes with high potential for archaeological preservation. While useful for conservation and heritage management, the procedures underpinning predictive modeling also provide a hypothetical laboratory for experimenting with the known archaeological and ethnographic records, as they relate to current theories of human behavior. Such modeling is applied here in an effort to harness data of disparate quality and detail on the Mesolithic period (c. 10,0006000 years BP) in the central river valley of the Netherlands. Specifically, GIS techniques are paired with environmental modeling software to simulate human land use. Brown, Batsulwin [172] see Parker, John Brown, Brooke M.

The small site of Capillapamba in the Yumbo region in the forested slopes of northwestern Pichincha province offers yet another perspective on such sites, which show amazing variability in size, configuration, and construction style. Capillapamba, which consists of a small residential compound and a tiny, stone-walled, terraced prominence that guards a stream crossing, suggests the diversity of Inka military strategies in the conquest and stabilization of Ecuador as well as the cost in infrastructure and personnel that conquest may have brought to the empire. Brown, Gary (Aztec Ruins Natl Monument) [117] The Transition Between Chacoan Colony and Center of the Middle San Juan Region: A View from Aztec Ruins Middle San Juan culture history began at Aztec Ruins with Earl Morris`s ideas about Chacoan colonization, abandonment, and reoccupation by non-Chacoan people. This history was extended by Morris from Aztec Ruins to other parts of the middle San Juan and adopted by subsequent researchers at both Chacoan outliers and smaller sites. Population declined in much of the area after collapse of the Chaco-based regional system, but my study of architectural evolution shows that large outliers where reoccupations have commonly been assumed are the very sites with long, continuous histories. These occupations are not static, however; they are punctuated by reorganization. Brown, Gary [201] see Diederichs, Shanna R.

Little attention has been directed toward how surplus could potentially be generated given the range of factors suppressing surplus generation in historically known southeastern societies. Crucial to overcoming these factors are differences in the ways in which labor is organized and in the ritual obligations created in segmentary societies to unite families with disparate interests.

Cumulative proportional curves indicate that mussel harvesting strategies alternated between plucking and

Furthermore, relatively stable mean shell sizes suggest that the prehistoric Cedros Islanders were able to avoid the tragedy of the commons in spite of the relative accessibility of mussel beds. [132] First Chair Brown Vega, Margaret (Penn State University) [229] Beyond Battles: Interactions in Times of War on the Northcentral coast of Perú War comprises myriad social interactions: combat, resistance, alliance, exchange, ritual, and avoidance. Recent treatments of war emphasize the identification and examination of physical violence and military spaces. Yet during war, interactions that are not explicitly violent also contribute to the transformation of social relationships and identities. For example, rituals of solidarity may be as important as actual combat. Thus, the archaeology of war entails a complex mosaic of seemingly contradictory evidence. Using regional data from late prehispanic fortifications along the northcentral coast of Perú, and ritual contexts from one such fort, I illustrate non-conflict interactions shaped by war.

Brumfiel, Elizabeth (Northwestern University) [21] How and why the Aztecs invented Otomi ethnicity Taking the Otomí as an example, I argue that neither language groupings such as the Otomí nor regional groups such as the Chalca constituted ethnic identities prior to Aztec dominance. Aztec rulers imposed these ethnic identities upon Postclassic populations to promote their own historiographic and administrative purposes. Archaeologists should not expect to see such groups marked archaeologically by distinctive food, dress or other practices. Instead, such diacritica might observed at the local city-state and its calpulli and teccalli subdivisions, whose identities were rooted in shared histories of migration and settlement, and thus might qualify as ethnic groups.

Fort Spokane in Northeastern Washington served as a federal Indian boarding school from 1899 until 1910. Investigations there in 2010 focused on the dormitories for the young girls and for the young boys. Differences between the personal adornment artifacts found in these structures reveals how Indian children at boarding schools were indoctrinated in Euro-American gender roles and how they may have resisted those roles.

Since 2000, two University of Northern Colorado

(UNC) projects, the Sacred Landscapes Project (Rocky Mountain National Park) and North Park Cultural Landscapes Project have produced substantive evidence, in the form of hunting camp excavations, AMSdated ceramics, and lichen-dated ritual features that prehistoric Ute occupation of what was historically known as traditional Ute lands began no later than 800, and possibly as early as 1000, years ago.

However, few have focused and the spaces in between the ritual nodes along the ceque lines. This past summer, I followed three ceque lines and paid particular attention to the spaces in between the previous documented ritual nodes in order to provide a more robust picture of these ceremonial routes that once played an integral role in the Inca religious system.

This hypothesis was tested with standard and geometric morphometric data recorded on Clovis and Folsom points from the Southern Plains and Southwest that are associated with mammoth or bison remains. Points used to hunt mammoth were found to be larger and of a different shape than points used to hunt bison, which supports the hypothesis. However, when point type was taken into account as well as prey size the results ran

Family life was a social space to continue cultural traditions, foster intimate relationships, and reinforce values. This paper examines archaeological patterns from a 19th-century free black homesite and asks how everyday practices created and reiterated familial relationships and the black family as a social institution. This paper will also show how an extended concept of relationality within black families became fundamental to the creation of interdependent African American communities. Bullock Kreger, Meggan [72] Morbidity and Mortality in the Postclassic Urban Center of Cholula A paleodemographic and paleopathological study of 309 Postclassic skeletons from Cholula was completed to characterize morbidity and mortality in this Mesoamerican city.

Combined, these methods allow for very precise identification of shellfish collection by providing greater seasonal amplitude in isotope profiles. Beyond issues of accuracy and precision, we also confront the problem of sample selection. We use our results to gauge the capacity of archaeology to infer millennia-long patterns of site use from limited samples representing particular shellfish collection events. Burgchardt, Lucy (University of Cambridge), Donna Nash (University of North Carolina - Greensboro) and Mark Golitko (Chicago Field Museum) [193] Obsidian sourcing points to inclusive exchange for the people of Cerro Mejía Peru's Moquegua Valley was a popular locale during the Middle Horizon, and became home to many travelers. The settlements Cerro Baúl and Cerro Mejía represent the southernmost extent of Wari expansion during the Middle Horizon. However, the supply network these sites used appears not to have been exclusive. In 2009, excavations of two households on Cerro Mejía produced 140 obsidian artifacts which were sourced using p-XRF equipment. The presence of diverse obsidian sources has indicated that the inhabitants of Cerro Mejía had a complex trade network shaped by migration, affiliation with the Wari capital, and interaction with Tiwanaku neighbors.

With some of the earliest evidence of human occupation located in coastal and island contexts and a sea level that was as much as 100 meters lower than today, there are ample reasons to believe that remains of human occupation will be found in offshore contexts of Southern California. Using high-resolution bathymetric data and estimates of sea level change, we develop a model of now-underwater locations that potentially contain evidence of prehistoric human activity.

Located on the Red Canyon Ranch southwest of Thermopolis, Wyoming, the Nostrum Springs Stage Station is adjacent to the Wind River Indian Reservation. During the summer of 2010, I undertook preliminary investigations on the stage station. Through this research, I intended to investigate Shoshone intersections with other travelers utilizing the area during the reservation area and into the 20th century. I discovered many additional areas of inquiry ranging from the presence of a potential blacksmith`s shop in the station to a cartridge found behind the building that may indicate that someone at the station had connections to the Russian Revolution.

Time perspectives within cultural heritage management Preservation is an essential part of cultural heritage management; sites and monuments are protected in order to be kept intact for the future. Accordingly site managers encounter difficulties dealing with sites whose foremost qualities are the processes of change and decay that they are undergoing. It would seem that cultural heritage should be forever or not at all. The belief in this kind of eternal` perspective is in no way new, but the present preoccupation with sustainability has reinforced it and placed it in a new discourse.

[22] Ground Stone Tool Analysis: Contributions of a UseWear Approach In the world of lithic analysis, it is rare for use-wear techniques to be applied to the study of ground stone tools. Yet ground stone tools are used to make sweeping generalizations about subsistence strategies, notably in California where mortars and pestles are assumed to have been used for processing acorns and viewed as hallmarks of a lifestyle distinct from coastal adaptations. Experimentation with processing tools and use-wear analysis techniques have both broadened and refined the kinds of inferences made about prehistoric foraging and farming activities. Tool designs and the nature of processed substances are discussed.

[58] Architectural Form and Space in the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin, Mexico Ancient architecture is an expression of past human settlement, reflecting the manner in which the larger society was organized. Despite its ubiquity, Prehispanic architecture is poorly understood in the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin, Michoacán, Mexico. However, recent settlement pattern survey in the eastern Lake Pátzcuaro Basin provides new insights into the relationship between architecture, social space, and the formation of the Purépecha (Tarascan) Empire. Here I examine the form and spatial organization of prehistoric architecture at Sacapu Angamucu to gain new insights into the development of social complexity and the built environment.

Applying zooarchaeological records to fish conservation issues in the Upper Columbia River Zooarchaeological records can greatly assist conservation efforts by providing base-line knowledge of pre-development species distributions. As Lyman demonstrated over a decade ago, transferring archaeological data to conservation biology introduces several interpretive challenges, including determining whether species scarcity in the archaeological record reflects true absence or some other factor (e.g., sampling, taphonomy, past cultural practices). Questions of past salmon distribution in the Similkameen River of central Washington/British Columbia have arisen in response to proposed dam construction.

Buzon, Michele [152] see Smith, Stuart T. Byrd, Brian (Far Western) and Adrian Whitaker (Far Western) [263] Was Abalone a Low-Ranked Resource along the Central California Coast? Prehistoric middens dominated by abalone shell occur in a variety of contexts along the Central and Southern Coast of California. Typically, abalone is considered a high-ranked resource indicative of favorable environmental conditions and an absence of dietary stress. In the Monterey Peninsula area, abalone exploitation explodes around 700 years ago, characterized by numerous abalone shell pavement sites. We examine potential causal factors for this sudden focus on abalone. Drawing on insights from optimal foraging theory, we suggest that abalone represent a low-ranked resource requiring intensified procurement and should be considered, in this case, a marker of resource intensification.

Modified bone and antler artifacts from six sites in Florida`s St. Johns River Valley were analyzed to reconstruct the processes of tool production and use. Existing classification systems are inconsistent because archaeologists have assumed technofunction based merely on general tool shape. This study`s correlations between use-wear and tool morphology help tease apart possible tool functions. Experimental replication proved especially useful in understanding observed microwear. By incorporating data from sites with exceptional preservation, in-depth studies of organic tools contribute to a more realistic picture of prehistoric technological organization.

Evidence suggests that the elements from this wealthy house`s cache pit resulted from a single event of feasting. The use of dogs as a delicacy is unique compared to the Keatley Creek site, where analysis concludes many of the dogs died of natural causes.

Experimental data, derived from an incremental bone crushing protocol, provide important insights into the relationship between NISP and specimen fragmentation. They also have practical implications regarding the effectiveness of potential measures of the degree to which an assemblage has been fragmented. In particular, they suggest that specimen size--which is a more direct measure and which can be determined easily through digital image analysis--is a more useful gauge of fragmentation than is the ratio of MNI (or MNE) to NISP. Finally, the experiments allow exploration of how assemblage-level bone volume density characteristics respond to the effects of mechanical crushing.

Early human evidence consists of deeply buried occupation surfaces situated underneath Early and Middle Holocene naturally accumulated deposits.

The comparative application of these methods to archaeological research and extant collections among the Channel Islands, and adjacent mainland, would reveal a more sophisticated understanding of prehistoric seafaring than presently exists.

In this poster we present chronological information derived from luminescence dating of ceramic roof tiles from two archaeological sites in Central Asia. Luminescence was used to determine whether or not these sites, thought to be a burials from within the last millennium, were multiple use sites. Casson, Sarah (Grinnell College) [6] Sinagua Point Lithics: a Comparison of Four Sites in the Flagstaff Region Projectile points from four Sinagua sites near Flagstaff, Arizona were analyzed to better understand variability in chronology, point attributes and functional types during intermittent Sinagua occupation between A.D. 1064­ 1300. The Sinagua were making small arrow points from flakes of mostly obsidian and collecting large Archaic atlatl dart points. Abundant points showing a high degree of variability without much chronological change characterize Sinagua sites. We looked for overall correlations among the small point collection in notching, material, damage and other categories. Some materials and types correlated in ways that probably indicate cultural affiliations.

discussion of Lithic technological organization: cases from Patagonia Argentina. We understand the functional analysis of lithic material, not as a particularized analytic approximation of knowing how and in which way a tool was used, but as a methodology inserted in a bigger context. To know how a tool was used allows us to discuss the main factor that determines the different ways of production, typological structures, assemblage`s variability and issues related to style. It will be proposed to include Functional analysis in a wide approach chained to a complex process of knowledge of technological organization, where Ethnoarchaeology and Experimental Archaeology must be involved. Cases from Patagonia will be presented.

Austin State University) [190] Maya Blue in Central Peten: Further Evidence of the Exchange of Ideas and not Things Maya Blue traditionally has been thought to have been manufactured only in northern Yucatán and traded throughout the Maya region. Chemical analysis of a blue pigment excavated from a Postclassic temple at Ixlú, Petén, Guatemala demonstrates that Maya Blue was made in at least two regions. These new data show that the knowledge of Maya Blue manufacture was transferred to central Petén. In support of the transfer of knowledge hypothesis, chemical and petrographic data from other artifact categories that are commonly thought to have been traded, especially Postclassic incensarios, further indicate that ideas were being exchanged instead of actual artifacts.

along the San Juan River near Farmington, NM. San Juan College field school excavations from 2008-2010 have concentrated on the great kiva. Testing has revealed the great kiva to have originated during the Chacoan time period, possibly as early as A.D. 10001050, with evidence of later post A.D. 1200 remodeling. Architectural characteristics are described and compared with other great kivas of the same time period in the Middle San Juan and Chaco regions.

This paper compares Hohokam variation in treatment of cremated bodies (including fragmentation and spatial context) to examine ways in which personhood was differentially expressed in the final disposition of Hohokam bodies. The variation is compared to ethnographic and ethnohistoric records on Southwestern indigenous groups where similar social practices were documented. While contexts of final disposition varied, cremations and some objects of material culture appear to pass through similar pathways that suggest parallel perceptions of and intra-community differences in personhood.

We discuss information from a cache of figurines found together in the cemetery associated with the Huaca Loro temple mound displaying diverse hairdos and dress, as well as from other lines of evidence (e.g., funerary treatments, sacrificial and technological styles, ancient DNA and biodistance) that together suggest that this society was characterized by at least two sympatric ethnic groups that had different social status.

[265] Coring Methods to Locate Buried Archeological Sites and Assess Buried Landscapes during Intertidal Archeological Surveys Through field research at numerous tidal-freshwater and salt marshes in the Middle Atlantic and New England regions, methods have been developed for minimizing field time and maximizing scientific data collection. Methodological considerations included sampling instruments, spacing, and recordation of detailed sedimentologic and stratigraphic information. Field research on core spacing has shown that an 8m grid is a compromise between data collection and speed of coring. Core stratigraphic recordation emphasizes the changes in facies and is focused on identifying buried upland landscapes. This type of sampling strategy facilitates high-resolution paleogeographic reconstruction of transgressed upland landscapes allowing an assessment of site integrity.

Patterns in architectural design, growth, and burning suggest that conflict shaped decisions about site placement and layout, admission of newcomers, and, in some cases, village abandonment. In this environment, neighboring villages differed sharply in their ability to develop and maintain religious facilities. Some built, remodeled, and added new ritual spaces and features throughout their occupations; others did not. The Salinas evidence increases our understanding of the variable experience of conflict and religiosity in villages constructed around enclosed plazas. Chamberlin, Matthew [53] see Solometo, Julie P.

Chang, Claudia (Sweet Briar College) [54] Revisiting Iron Age Landscapes in the Semirechye Region of southeastern Kazakhstan Iron Age sites of Semirechye are identified as burial mounds or habitations. The interrelationship between the mortuary complex and the lived-in` places of villages and hamlets remains poorly understood and thus disarticulated. Clusters of circular living houses around a central structure may reveal the nature of agro-pastoral village organization. These settlement data coupled with the location of burial mounds provide the basis for interpreting a unified symbolic and socio-political system on the periphery of the Eurasian steppe. Whether the Talgar Valley represents a local center or not, and its spheres of interaction within a regional context will be discussed. Chang, Vanessa (Antiquus Archaeological Consultants Ltd.)

Through the analysis of lithic deposits may reaffirm the cultural type of South Yale. Variant raw materials provide information upon the resources these people had in the past. Striatiaions of these materials can uncover the vegetation and dietary habits of the people. The analysis of lithic use depict a longstanding ­ sedentary culture of the South Yale.

Archaeologists have consciously or unconsciously incorporated A-series (tensed) or B-series (fixed) time into their approaches to the past (even contending the existence of a past). Our constructions and investigations of archaeological questions or problems are structured and guided by our prior commitment to A- or B-series time.

Chase, Arlen (University of Central Florida) and Diane Chase (University of Central Florida) [90] An Ancient Maya Urban Landscape: Integrated Settlement and Terracing in the Vaca Plateau The ancient Maya city of Caracol, Belize provides an excellent New World example of tropical low-density urbanism. The center housed 100,000 people at A.D. 650 and was sustained through the intensive use of agricultural terraces. Combining excavation data and onground survey information with a 200 square kilometer LiDAR Digital Terrain Model makes it possible to model how Caracol developed into a huge metropolis by A.D. 650 and to correlate this development with heightened infrastructural organization and intra-site integration. These data suggest that the ancient Caracol Maya maintained a long-term, highly complex relationship with their anthropogenic landscape.

Traditionally, sites with this so-called Harappan material culture have been considered together as evidence for a migration into the region. Recent research, however, demonstrates considerable material diversity within this category of settlement. Here, I present the results of this ongoing work and discuss how the production of Harappan things in Gujarat was integral to the production of Harappan people in this borderland region.

Scholarly reconstructions vacillate between complex and simple systems. This paper positions 26 years of archaeological data from Caracol, Belize in terms of current debates about ancient Mesoamerican economy. Research at Caracol has identified venues for marketplaces and shown that ancient residential households were actively involved in specialized production. Data suggest that Caracol`s elite were concerned with controlling distribution in an economic system far more complex than that implied via simple models of feasting.

Ethnohistorical and recent archaeological data from Huarochirí, Peru, show that, before and through Inka and Spanish colonizations of the area, numinous objects/places, the past, and political legitimacy were inseparable, making their adoption and/or conversion paramount foci in these localimperial encounters.

Paleolithic research histories in the center of the Old World The impact of early discoveries in Africa and Europe heavily influenced the way some of the Indian evidence was initially interpreted and also the way associated stone tool classification frameworks were subsequently presented. Specific examples of changing concepts and interpretations over the last century are presented at thematic, regional and site-specific research histories. Recent discoveries are briefly mentioned to illustrate the growing significance of the Indian Subcontinent for understanding Paleolithic transitions in Asia.

I discuss the early Pulltrowser pottery and the implications of its discovery in this habitable environmental zone. Cunil material dates cultural activity at Pulltrowser Swamp to an era when sedentary village life began in the central Maya Lowlands and subsistence practices emphasizing maize agriculture were heightened. The early Maya may have been using swampy lands to increase agricultural productivity. I discuss and compare the contexts of Cunil Horizon material at other sites with that of Pulltrowser Swamp. Chen, Pochan (National Taiwan University) [23] Exploring the spatial relationships of the Yangfutou cemetery, Yunnan, China Dian is an ancient state in Dian Lake area of Yunnan from the Warring States period (475-221 B.C.) to Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C. ­ 8 A.D.). Since 1950`s, archaeologists discover many Dian cemeteries, including Shizhaishan, Lijiashan, Tianzimiao, Batatai and Yangfutou. Each cemetery has several hundred burials with abundant burial materials. Many scholars adopt multivariate statistical techniques to analyze these complex cemeteries; however, very few of them emphasize spatial variants. In this paper, I will use GIS techniques to analyze the spatial relationships among the burials in the Yangfutou cemetery and reconstruct their social structures.

In Nepeña, a coastal valley in Ancash, our recent work has brought insights into early forms of enclosure compounds and lifestyles during the first millennium BC. Here, we review enclosure designs ascribed to the Salinar phenomenon. By considering and comparing variations at the regional level, we suggest that Salinar is best understood in terms of situated historical processes that included increased intergroup conflicts, and differential political patterns of integration and fragmentation, both linked to the demise of the Chavín sphere and the emergence of dense settlements.

Archaeologically excavated metal materials from Yunnan have assisted in studying cultural/technological interactions between Bronze and Iron Age sites in southwest China and surrounding regions. However, occasional misinterpretations of aspects in the material culture in Yunnan have led to misleading conclusions as well as controversial issues when viewed in the chronological, cultural, and technological frameworks of Asian prehistory. In the light of recent metallurgical studies of Yunnan artifacts and new archaeological finds from 2nd millennium sites in western Yunnan, this work investigates the research strategies used to generate such debatable issues.

Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values of bones were used to characterize diet. MtDNA analysis tested whether the birds displayed the distinctive SW domestic turkey haplotype. Experimental analysis of DNA microsatellites was used to investigate possible parent-offspring or sibling relationships among the birds.

A comprehensive online database has been constructed to provide an analytical tool for recording, sequencing, and comparing various formal, decorative, and compositional attributes of Lapita pottery assemblages. Using the pottery assemblage of Kamgot, Anir Islands, Papua New Guinea, this paper illustrates the usefulness of such a database, and how may it contribute to the study of Lapita prehistory. Chiykowski, Tanya (SUNY Binghamton) [96] Domestic production in lithic analysis from Northwest Mexico Access to raw material, procurement strategies, control in distribution, sharing of technical knowledge and exchange of both raw and finished materials all relate to the dynamics of production of lithics at a local level. Lithic analysis from the Viejo Period in Chihuahua, Mexico illustrates these points by examining connections at a community, inter-site and regional level. Research in the region demonstrates a lack of specialized production of lithic tools, so variation in this non-discursive material culture reflects the domestic production of material culture in a transitional period between hunter-gathering

Christie, Jessica (East Carolina University) [103] Exporting Inkaness: An Argument For Replication in Architecture and Sculpture in the Ayacucho Region This paper discusses how certain aspects of Inka administration as well as ideology were materialized in architecture and sculpture at Vilcashuaman and the associated site Intihuatana in the Departamento Ayacucho. The center of Vilcashuaman clearly reflects the layout of Cusco and conceptual similarities extend to the poorly known Intihuatana site. The latter exhibits a palace compound structured around several sequential courtyards, carved rocks, and visual orientation toward Vilcashuaman. It is argued that not only the urban design of Cusco but also the materialization of ideological concepts as well as cultural landscapes were exported as markers of Inka identity. Chuipka, Jason (Woods Canyon Archaeological Consultants) [117] The Legacy of Chaco in the Upper San Juan Region, A.D. 900-1200 The region north of the San Juan River and east of the Animas River was sparsely settled immediately prior to the Pueblo II period and almost entirely abandoned after A.D. 1150. This paper will examine how involvement in the Chacoan regional system acted as a catalyst to the entrenchment of traditional social practices rather than spurring emulation or change. This contradictory consciousness appears to have tempered the influence of Chaco in the region and likely influenced later populations that also resisted social trends occurring to the south and west in the post-Chacoan world of the A.D. 1200s.

In order to better understand prehistoric land-use patterns and trade routes, a sample of obsidian lithic debitage and tools were sent for obsidian hydration and sourcing analysis. A discussion of the results will include elements of the field transport and processing model, obsidian source locations, and new implications for Fremont flintknappers on the western Colorado Plateau.

ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 76TH ANNUAL MEETING

Dramatic changes in the procurement and exchange of obsidian occurred throughout the Hohokam World during the early 14th Century A.D. Some regions experienced substantial increases in exotic obsidian while other regions were suddenly cut off from sources that had been exploited for centuries. Using more than 3000 sourced obsidian samples from nearly 100 sites, we argue that small groups of ancestral Puebloan immigrants both facilitated and disrupted the circulation of this valuable raw material within the Hohokam World. This represents another line of evidence for the disproportionate power possessed by this minority group. [52] Second Chair Clark, Jeffery [52] see Hill, Brett [201] see Dungan, Katherine A.

Clark, Joelle (Northern Arizona University) [139] Footprints of the Ancestors: Hopi Intergenerational Learning Hopi footprints are the archaeological landscapes and the oral history that surrounds them. They connect people to place, to the environment, to the past, and to the future. The Footprints of the Ancestors project is an intergenerational partnership that facilitates Hopi cultural preservation. The primary goal is to bring together Hopi youth and our established team of Hopi elders, cultural specialists, and archaeologists in an experiential and collaborative endeavor. This poster depicts the project, its accomplishments, and impact on Hopi youth. Clark, John (Brigham Young University) [157] Tracking the Origins of Agriculture in Middle America Scholars have pursued the origins of domesticated plants and agriculture the world over for at least two centuries, with no final resolution in sight. Provisional answers along the way have depended on primary definitions of phenomena, research agendas, excavation luck, academic politics, improved techniques for recovering plant residua, and analytical methods for extracting chemical signatures from bones and artifacts. I review a century of shifting evidence and narratives for the origins of agriculture in Middle America and the current contenders for a master narrative. [88] Discussant Clark, John E.

Ethnographic interviews, census records and detailed maps depicting modern day land-use provide information about the social, economic, and ritual organization of communities in Central Mongolia today. This information can then supplement some of the ways in which we approach the archaeological investigation of communities in the area. Clark, Terence (University College London) [232] Archaeology of communities within the Salish Sea:

grappling with issues of scale and identity. According to Redfield (1955), the community is the principal unit of biological and cultural reproduction. It is the scale at which culture is replicated and innovation adopted. As such, communities may be the most relevant emic classification of culture therefore, understanding the nature of past communities is critical to understanding past cultures. Building on the archaeology of communities (Canuto and Yaeger 2000) framework which has previously be employed to delineate community-level groups in more complex societies, this paper will attempt to identify and describe emically meaningful scales of interaction, communities, within the prehistoric hunter gatherer cultures of the Salish Sea.

Scholars have offered differing interpretations of the size and permanence of the site`s population. This Epiclassic site provides a good case study to examine socioecological issues because of its large size, fragile environmental context, and position as the first major center in the region. If resource depletion were occurring we expect to see increasing reliance on lagomorphs compared to artiodactyls, increasing bone fragmentation for nutrient extraction, and increasing abundance of less desirable species. Initial results are presented. Clewlow, C (Ancient Enterprises Inc) [230] Discussant Clifford, Walter (University of South Carolina) [148] The Distribution of Paleoethnobotanical Remains from a Late Classic Maya Site in Northwestern Belize Most studies of ancient Maya subsistence are based on ethnohistorical accounts that model a reliance on maize, beans, and squash. Our investigations of botanical remains recovered from an array of shovel tests at Guijarral, a Late Classic (AD 600-900) Maya farmstead, have shown an expanded botanical repertoire beyond the aforementioned trinity. Some plant distributions suggest the importance of wild plants, and allow construction of hypotheses regarding the locations of activities within the site and begin to reconstruct the agroecology associated with Late Classic provisioning. Data presented here demonstrate the importance of considering the potential for local control of perennial foodstuffs.

improbable. Given the degree of bone remodeling, these specimens received post-injury care, no matter breakage intentionality. In earlier sites, turkey exploitation occurred for various economic reasons and healed breakage frequency is comparatively high. As other resources became scarce during later periods, exploitation shifted to turkey as meat and healed breakage frequency decreased. This poster demonstrates how turkey were tended until resource depression changed the role of turkey in the diet. Coats, Jennifer (California State University, Los Angeles) [266] Caves and Burial: A Critical Examination of Maya Ideology Surrounding Cave Interment During three years of survey, the Midnight Terror Cave Project recovered large quantities of human remains. This raised the question as to why the Maya utilized caves for interment. A frequently utilized model suggests that caves were viewed as being the land of the dead or the pathway to the land of the dead, and, therefore, an appropriate place for interment. This model, however, has never been explicitly formulated or rigorously tested though it continues to be a factor in interpretation. The author analyzes the theoretical roots and inception of the cave-underworld model and cautions its use in cave interpretation. [266] First Chair Coats, Larry (University of Utah) [91] The Distribution and Variety of High Elevation Sites in Range Creek Canyon, Utah Most of the recorded sites in Range Creek Canyon, Utah are less than 50 meters in elevation above the alluvial floodplain. But intuitive surveys since 2006, focused on major ridge lines, have revealed numerous high elevation sites far above the canyon floor. These sites are between 1800 m and 2400 m in elevation, ranging between 120 m to 600 m above the nearest alluvial floodplain. These sites exhibit a variety of forms, from residential or camp sites, to storage features, or rock art panels. Diverse artifacts have been recorded at these sites, including ceramics, lithics, and ground stone items. [91] see Brunelle, Andrea Cobb, Allan and James Brady (California State University, Los Angeles) [266] The Implications of Ritual Pathways in Midnight Terror Cave Belize In the last two decades, archaeologists have begun to map ritual pathways in Maya caves but these features are still poorly understood. Midnight Terror Caves contains the longest and most elaborate ritual pathway yet reported. This paper describes the construction and shows that it forms a documentable circuit that permits archaeologists to reconstruct movement through the cave. Finally, we offer possible reasons for the construction of such a feature in the cave and make comparisons with other known examples. Cobb, Charles (South Carolina Inst of Archaeology & Anthropology) and Dawnie Steadman (Binghamton University) [198] The Class Process, Symbolic Capital, and Mississippian Epidemiological Transitions The class process--the production and distribution of

surplus labor--can undergo profound changes during epidemiological transitions. Heightened morbidity in the Mississippian Southeast (USA) is traditionally attributed to a growing reliance on maize agriculture and demands on surplus labor. However, evidence from the Illinois and Cumberland Valleys demonstrates that an upsurge in regional conflict greatly impacted subsistence strategies and patterns of adverse health. We argue that these trends are linked in part to historical alterations in the organization of surplus labor and symbolic capital, where social reproduction via moundbuilding and other largescale ceremonial enterprises diminished in importance relative to rituals surrounding warfare and other activities. Cobos, Rafael (Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán) [90] Built Environment and Green Landscape: Settlement at the Ancient City of Chichén Itzá Archaeological data recovered at Chichén Itzá provide an excellent opportunity to analyze the way in which elite members, food producers, and commoners got together and permanently occupied the same settlement through several centuries. These individuals organized their space used for the construction of elaborate and nonelaborate architecture as well as zoning the land that functioned for agricultural purposes. To understand Chichén Itzá´s intrasite morphology can help us to explain how a dispersed settlement sheltered population capable of managing the organization of their space and resources. This also mirrors social, political, and economic aspects of the internal. [221] Discussant Cochran, Jennifer [51] see Brown, M.

Active research in this area frequently draws on models from behavioral ecology to understand how and why changes in subsistence patterns occur across time and space. Synthesizing some of this recent research, this paper explores how by focusing on work, California archaeologists have come to understand a great deal about the colonization of the region, the relationships between human foraging decisions and environmental change and how these dynamic interactions intertwine with historical perturbations to produce the diversity of life-ways represented across the state.

Cogswell, Lucy (California State University, Northridge) [186] Jade as a Prestige Good at La Blanca, Guatemala In terms of clear cut social distinction being determined by prestige goods, most archaeological focus gets put upon Classic sites. However, the Middle Preclassic should not be fully ignored, and should instead be stressed upon as supporting the beginnings of this tradition. The site of La Blanca offers an interesting look at different types of household assemblages and suggests basic jade production at the site. Cohen, Anna (University of Washington) and Christopher T.

This may hold true for fish populations of the Georgia coast (USA), which were heavily used. To examine whether humans impacted fish populations in the past, growth increments in Late Archaic and modern hardhead catfish (Ariopsis felis) otoliths were analyzed. Growth curves and growth rates indicate that modern catfish populations grow to larger sizes at comparable ages compared to archaeological populations. Under the density-dependent model of animal growth, this suggests that modern populations are experiencing environmental disturbances impacting growth which may be related to human activities.

Black appears to be the predominant color used by early Basketmaker II occupants; later Basketmaker paintings present a variety of colors. Along with colors,

distinctive types of images and techniques were used to mark discrete spaces and clusters of archaeological features within the two shelters.

One is to summarize the results of an on-going program of research in which we are using large samples of radiocarbon dates to shed light on important issues concerning the Early Paleoindians, including the speed of colonization of North America, the timing and nature of the Clovis-Folsom transition, and whether Clovis disappeared as a result of an extraterrestrial comet impact in the Great Lakes region. The other goal is to highlight several major flaws in a recent critique of the main methods we have employed in this research, diffusion analysis and summed probability distribution analysis.

Ceramics and architecture appear to reflect a growing reliance on local pottery production and permanent occupation of river level sites in the Canyon. However, ceramic analysis also demonstrated considerable variability within the late wares, such as the Shinarump series of gray, white and red wares.

Collins, Brian [259] see Fairley, Helen Collins, Joshua [222] Discussant Collins, Laurel [222] Fluvial Geomorphology of Quiroste Valley and Whitehouse Creek during the last 200 Years During Portola`s 1769 exploration of costal California, Whitehouse Creek was already incised within Quiroste Valley. Carbon dates from the uppermost terrace indicate the valley was building upwards by 8000 BP. By 1769, the creek had developed an inner floodplain with several inset terraces that supported groves of coast redwood. Archeological evidence indicates the valley flat and inset terraces were used contemporaneously. Based on tree coring and stream surveys, the creek bed has incised 57ft since Portola`s visit, due mainly to twentieth century upstream dams and water diversions. Historical stream incision has probably dewatered the valley floor relative to pre-contact conditions.

Monument studies have relied primarily on photographs and derived drawings. Because many of these Formative Period multi-ton sculptures are carved in the round, traditional photos and drawings are often unable to depict these pieces adequately, with their faint and fragile carved surface details difficult to discern. Using close range 3D laser scanning, these data are now being used for iconographic and epigraphic research and have potential for preservation, restoration, and replica production. Collins, Lori [82] see Mcleod, Bart Collins, Ryan (Brandeis University) [28] The Raised-Heel and Ritual Process Among scholars, the raised-heel pose in late Classic Maya art has had a quarter century-spanning visual and hieroglyphic linkage to dance. However, this connection is rendered problematic when comparing the contextualized chronology and distribution of the raisedheel to that of the T516 sign, representative of the verb ak ot, to dance. This paper reexamines the raised-heel pose through a discussion of the associated semasiographic, epigraphic, and archaeological contexts.

By focusing on continuities between ceramic and sculpted representations, this paper argues for a new interpretation of the raised-heel, expressing a theme of liminality in the process of death, internment, and resurrection. [28] First Chair Coltrain, Joan (University of Utah) [91] Evidence for Fremont Maize Farming in the Soil Organic Chemistry of Range Creek Canyon The density of granaries and other structures in Range Creek Canyon suggests that Fremont groups likely farmed the best-watered sections of the canyon bottom. However, shallow middens with relatively limited assemblages of refuse raise questions about both the intensity and duration of Fremont occupation. Here I present evidence for maize farming in the soil organic matter of a meter deep core taken from a spring-watered flat adjacent to the creek. The stable carbon isotope signature of soils dating to the Fremont period clearly indicates the presence of organic material consistent with the isotope chemistry of maize.

This conclusion is re-evaluated using carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of bone collagen from the two primary species of small mammals from the previous studies: pocket gophers (Thomomys talpoides) and pygmy rabbits (Brachylagus idahoensis). Isotopic evidence from the small mammal distribution over time may help refine current models for climate change, by providing alternate forms of evidence to test these hypotheses.

The provenance of the artifacts seems to be deep-shaft tombs. This paper describes the collection and analyzes the ritual use of ceramics, focusing on those known as Piartal pottery. Overpainting of these vessels--part of local elite paraphernalia--may represent curation of serving bowls in relation to funerary rituals. Implications for a broader understanding of ritual vessels in the Northern Highlands are explored.

AD 1325-1600) has resulted in the identification of a wide range of burial orientations, body positions, grave accoutrements, and age/sex variation. However, recent analysis of Classic period burial patterning in the southern area of the Northern Rio Grande region indicates the presence of a highly conservative set of burial practices throughout the Classic Period. In addition, this analysis reveals a potential disruption in the conservative nature of the burial practices after ca. AD 1450 suggesting an influx of non-Tiguex peoples into the area.

Cordy-Collins, Alana (University of San Diego) [125] Professor Carol J. Mackey: Homenaje The contributions to Andean anthropology made and ongoing by Dr. Carol Mackey are impressive and significant. From the Peruvian southern sierra to the north coast, this UC Berkeley-trained scholar has for over 40 years sought to enlarge our understanding of ancient Andean culture history by posing field-testable questions. Through Dr. Mackey`s archaeological and iconographic research we now recognize both extensive patterns and critical details about cultural development, interaction, and succession on the Peruvian north coast. Equally important, however, Mackey has taught and mentored an impressive number of young scholars who have gone on achieve their own successes in Andean archaeology. [156] see Tyson, Rose A.

Settlement studies require multiple lines of data and multiple scales of analysis before sufficiently advanced settlement patterns can be discerned. Archaeological research data within the project area has produced a preliminary dataset including: settlement configuration, land use, ecological data, and water management.

Cossich, Margarita [8] see Paredes-Umaña, Federico A. Costamagno, Sandrine [17] see Rendu, William Costello, Sarah (University of Houston) [47] Methodologies in the Study of Seals and Sealing Early Dynastic banquet seals from Mesopotamia offer a case study of how a multiplicity of approaches directed at a small corpus of seals can yield a rich picture of social roles, in particular the roles of elite women. In this paper I combine approaches, looking at the material from which the seals are made, the images they bear and the meaning of those scenes, the performativity of seals as jewelry, and the disposal of some of the seals in a lavish public funerary rite. Together, these various approaches demonstrate how seals functioned to constitute power among elite Sumerian women. Costin, Cathy (California State University, Northridge) [198] The Cooption of Surplus: Social Costs and Political Benefits in the Inka Empire A hallmark of socioeconomic complexity is that people produce goods in excess of their individual or household needs (that is, a surplus) in order to participate in exchange networks, pay rent, and/or meet tribute demands. Depending on sociopolitical circumstances, this intensification of production can develop gradually or can be implemented abruptly. This intensification can have myriad affects within and among households. In this paper, I consider the various ways in which changes in the control over the power to mandate intensification of production (i.e., demands to produce or increase a surplus) affected people with different social identities in the Inka empire.

The Sechelt, a northern Coast Salish Nation, did not have direct access to salmon. We consider how the Sechelt built a complex culture away from the Fraser River by taking advantage of a large territory with diverse resources, opportunities for trade with interior and coastal groups, and ease of access through their land via waterways that penetrated to the upper reaches of the territory. We use the Sechelt case to model an alternate path to complexity for the Salish Sea.

microscopic charcoal Analysis of pollen and microscopic charcoal from two wetlands in central coastal California document changes in vegetation and fire frequency over long-term time scales. Ecological changes recorded in wetland sediments can be attributed to human impact or climate change, with the impacts of Native American burning being the focus of this study. The record from Skylark Pond (~3,000 years) covers the late Holocene, an important time period for assessing the impacts of Native American burning and the changes brought about with European settlement. The record from Laguna de las Trancas (~60,000 years) includes the Last Glacial Maximum and the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. This long-term record, much of which precedes the most agreed upon time of human arrival in North America, will provide a pre-human context with which to compare the late Holocene record.

In this paper I build on the framework of the VEP`s agent-based simulation and examine the social interactions of our agents through exchange networks.

Craib, Donald (Cultural Heritage Partners, LLC) [184] Discussant Craig, Douglas (Northland Research) and John Marshall (Northland Research, Inc.) [52] Architectural Visibility and Population Dynamics in Late Hohokam Prehistory Reconstructing population dynamics with archaeological data is a challenging task under the best of circumstances. The task is especially challenging in the case of the Hohokam of south-central Arizona, because room counts--the method used to establish population parameters in other parts of the Southwest--are difficult to obtain without large-scale excavations. Additionally, many Hohokam settlements were occupied for hundreds of years; hence, the various components need to be unraveled. This paper reviews lessons learned from recent excavations at several late Classic period sites to reexamine the sharp decline in population postulated by many current interpretive models.

It was excavated in the 1950s and has been in the UNLV repository since that time. This cave site, between 600 and 1000 AD, contained the remains of at least 9 children between the ages of birth and 3 years as well as the remains of at least 2 adults. This project is a reanalysis of the remains involving a detailed reconstruction of their taphonomic context. These children represent a unique collection in terms of the paleodemography and paleopathology present. Crane, John [150] see Nelson, Shaun R.

The fluting technique appears in stratigraphy at the site of Manayzah (Yemen) and is dated to the late 7th / beginning of the 6th millennium BC Cal. This paper presents the chaîne opératoire of the fluting operations from the examination of fluted pieces and channel-flakes in stratigraphic contexts. This paper will discuss the functionality of the tools and the technical investment of the knappers, as well as some first analogies with the technological similarities and differences of American fluted points. [74] First Chair Crawford, Kristina (California State University, Chico) and Arran Bell (California State University, Chico) [77] A Tale of Inter-twined Identities: Ishi and Northern Californians Ishi is perhaps the most written about Indian in anthropological and literary works; each published work presents different ways of knowing Ishi. A renewed interest in Ishi began with the publication of Ishi in Two Worlds in 1961 and the commemoration of his discovery site in Oroville in 1965. County historical societies published accounts of Ishi as told by locals, and Ishi became part of the California History curriculum taught to fourth grade. This paper will examine local knowledge, children`s literary canon, and local stories to illustrate the importance of the idea of Ishi to Northern California identity.

They provide strong evidence that sea mammal oil burnt in lamps was not the sole fuel source. This paper presents the analysis of plant macrofossils

and charcoal remains collected across occupation layers and fill to investigate the function of the hearths, and the nature and availability of local fuel supplies between AD 1200-1700. One goal is to determine if, and how heavily, driftwood fuel was supplemented with bone or woody shrubs. Crawford, Laura [159] see Alix, Claire Creel, Andrea (University of California - Berkeley) [258] The Sense of Ritual in Votive Deposition at Kuntillet 'Ajrûd and the Southern Levant Votive deposition is a particularly constructive ritual act in which to explore the relationships between belief, ritual and object as materiality is so inherent to the act that it is simply incoherent without the dedicated item. My case study focuses on an 8th century BCE site in the Sinai desert. Its location in a liminal zone, fortress-like architecture and evocative art and inscriptions with the preponderance of small vessels suggests that votive deposition at Kuntillet 'Ajrûd was intentionally restricted to vessels and their contents. This highlights the tendency to ritualize quotidian objects and demonstrates the highly localized character of ritual. Creese, John (University of Toronto) [55] [Growing Pains: Spatial Dimensions of Northern Iroquoian Community (Re)Production] Analysis of Ontario Iroquoian village spatial order at three scales (hearth areas, longhouses, complete settlements) illustrates coordinated dimensions of social practice across a period of increasing settlement nucleation (A.D. 900 ­ 1500). Village growth is treated as a problem of community constitution that involved the emergence of systemic tensions associated with the scalar extension of collective social groups. A local-to-global spatial order, first established with the paired family hearth area, served as a precedent that was progressively exported to wider spatial scales so as to maintain a balance between sub-group or factional group formation, and the global integration of village communities.

This study integrates terrestrial LiDAR data, digital photography, and artifact data collected using GPS to convey the three dimensional spatial relationships within the trap. The final representation demonstrates the importance of the view shed in gathering and containing antelope, while the spatial analysis of the lithic artifacts, features and topography suggests possible strategies used to harvest them.

territory included actions into ideological, economic, and political sphere which explain in part the diversity and disparity that the state presence reached. Constructions like roads, tampus, pukaras, administrative centers, storage buildings, agricultural works, among others, were common in the entire annexed areas, but it is evident that its architecture, dimensions, monumentality and spatial density show contrasting regional differences. New evidence regarding Inca occupation in Northwest Argentina shows different situations along the period of Inca conquest and domination itself. According to the evaluation of data from a couple of archaeological sites, all of them characterized by Inca features, varied chronologies, and archaeological contexts like burial sites, production or agricultural sites, administrative, and fortified sites are examples of the complex process of population assimilation in Northwest Argentina. [68] see Williams, Veronica I. Crider, Destiny (Arizona State University) [36] Ceramic Pastes, Past Connections, and Social Reorganization: Epiclassic and Early Postclassic Interaction in the Basin of Mexico Pottery styles, technology, and chemical characterization provide evidence to assess shifting relationships in the Basin of Mexico during the Epiclassic and Early Postclassic periods. By taking a multi-scalar perspective, the patterns for the adoption and distribution of new pottery styles and traditions reflect changing boundaries of sociopolitical and economic interaction for this five hundred year span. Technological and stylistic attributes within pottery types reveals instances of both emulation and direct knowledge of production. Differing identities are identified locally and at the regional level in particular pottery complexes and symbol sets, contributing to new understanding of this period of dynamic reorganization. Crisci, Gino, Donatella Barca (Università della Calabria) and Domenico Miriello (Università della Calabria) [92] Mortars and plasters characterization and limestone provenance. A methodological approach Characterization of plasters and mortars, related to the architectural study, allows identifying the presence of different construction phases, which can be related to technological aspects and/or to the presence of different producers. This research identifies a new methodology to determine the provenance of raw materials employed in the making of mortars and plasters. The innovative method is based on the use of LA-ICP-MS on lime lumps preserved in the plasters and mortars. This study shows different examples of the application of this methodology to archaeological sites from both the Classical World and Mesoamerica. Croatt, Stephanie (Trinity University) [208] Social Strands: Dyadic Relationships as Means of Integration for Lebanese Immigrant Entrepreneurs in early 20th Century Yucatán, Mexico In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the Yucatán peninsula saw an increase in the number of immigrants coming to Mexico to seek economic gain. The diverse immigrant groups, and their entrepreneurs, faced the problem of building a support network in an unfamiliar environment. In order to have the means to integrate into, and negotiate corruption in Yucatecan society immigrant

entrepreneurs in Yucatán, Mexico had to forge interpersonal relationships outside of their immigrant network. I seek to describe how early 20th century Lebanese immigrant entrepreneurs used dyadic relationships to become an influential part of Yucatán`s social and political scene.

Here, we reconstruct population profiles, vestiges of posthumous body manipulation and mortuary pathways in 21 human assemblages from Maya caves, shelters, and cenotes, putting emphasis on the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itzá. Combining anthropological, taphonomic and contextual data sets, we highlight different ritual conducts, target populations for wet and dry cave deposits, pose new questions regarding the role of caves as human depositories and propose some ideas for future recovery techniques and analysis of human remains.

Carbonized twigs were sequentially selected from well-defined stratigraphic contexts based on iterative improvements to a probabilistic chronological model. Analytical error for these measurements is ±15-20 14C years. This greater precision and the absence of stratigraphic reversals eclipses previous radiocarbon work at Tlacuachero. We develop a chronological framework for a sequence of three clay floors (4960-4270 cal BP) and determine that the bedded shell that dominates these deposits accumulated rapidly during two episodes from 5050-4840 cal BP (2m) and 4380-4230 cal BP (3.5m).

Regional systematics are primarily based on three facies that were first defined by Garrod for the type site` of Tabun Cave, and yet these facies may not capture variation found in other Levantine assemblages. Here we examine the compositional integrity of the Tabun facies using a series of quantitative analyses on collections from 56 levels and 19 different sites to show that variability is often inconsistent with and can be masked by the classification system.

Our experiments focused on the removal of a Levallois flake from local basalt and were designed to elucidate the relationship between nodule morphology and Levallois flake. We also addressed issues of skill, intent and use to improve the recognition of residues from and overall understanding of this distinct early New World technology. The experiments demonstrated that local basalt is of sufficient size to produce Levallois flakes. They also have provided keys to recognizing and differentiating this technology from a bifacial trajectory. Cunnar, Geoffrey [262] see Stoner, Edward J. [262] see Estes, Mark B. Curet, L.

[125] First Chair Cyphers, Ann (IIA-UNAM) [182] Early Olmec communal spaces It is well-known that Middle Preclassic La Venta`s great plaza with its impressive stone monuments and mounds served as a communal space where messages about the cosmos were transmitted to large congregations of people attending special events and ceremonies. However, since Early Preclassic San Lorenzo does not show a similar design, the question arises whether public plazas were present there.

Multivariate analysis of the Chorrera house assemblage is applied to generate a view of daily practice in the late Formative.

To the south, good tool stone is lacking until reaching the Allendale cherts along the Central Savannah River. Presumably, metavolcanic Clovis points observed in South Carolina represent the southern extent of movement away from the Uwharries. Daniel, Tootsie [259] see Smalldon, Sue S.

A solar symbol in Egyptian iconography, by the early fourth millennium BCE the hunt of the ostrich is an elite activity in which human hunters realized the concept of the imposition of order over chaos. Ostrich hunting by desert dwellers, and delivery of ostrich feathers into the Nile Valley, mirrored the pacification of the solar eye goddess, who returns from the southern deserts into the Nile Valley at the time of the longest day and the coming of the Nile Inundation. Archaeological and epigraphic evidence for such rituals reveal interaction between Nilotic Egyptians and desert populations during a liminal period. Darwent, Christyann (U of California, Davis) [126] Evolution of Pinniped Hunting: A View from the Top Detailed zooarchaeological analyses of pinniped remains were hit and miss prior to the late 1980s, and for those who undertook such studies, they consisted of single assemblages/sites at best. Lyman`s Prehistory of the Oregon Coast (1991), and his various articles surrounding this publication influenced a generation of zooarchaeologists to tackle such issues as density/utility indices, patterns of butchery, prey demography, biogeography, and pinniped conservation. Following his pioneering research, I present an evolution of pinniped hunting in the circumpolar region and specifically focus on how the shift to walrus hunting signaled a major change in social organization across the Arctic.

The prehistoric response to this deficit was partly to use less stone, as quantities of stone artifacts were low, but also to engage in extensive reuse and recycling of stone materials.

In this paper, I explore graphic and phonetic techniques used to negotiate the space of and for historical narratives, land claims, and political

Davenport, James (Tulane University) and Kit Nelson (Tulane University) [142] Compositional Analysis Using pXRF of Ceramic Pastes and Pigments from the Late Intermediate Period of the North Central Coast of Perú The Late Intermediate Period was a time of social change in the North Central Coast of Peru, indicated by the presence of material artifacts from three cultures, the Chancay culture, the Chimú empire from the north, and the Inca empire from the south. Using the relatively new technology of portable X-Ray Fluorescence, we aim to add clarity to the complex political upheavals experienced by this region during this time period by examining ceramic pastes and pigments found at five different sites as well as determine the effectiveness of pXRF for this application.

[152] see Torres-Rouff, Christina David, Robert (University of California, Berkeley) [158] The Archaeology of Myth: Rock Art, Ritual Objects, and Sacred Landscapes of the Klamath Basin Recent research in the Klamath Basin has shown that rock art and landscape are intimately connected, mutually informed by indigenous notions of sacred places. Modeling this landscape has been possible through an understanding of Klamath­Modoc myth, leading some researchers to interpretations of the rock art that are largely in agreement with Klamath­Modoc spiritual beliefs. I take this approach a step further and propose interpretations for specific rock art images and ritual objects, arguing that myth harbors the fundamental logic that underpinned shamanic rituals that led to the creation of Klamath Basin rock art symbols and ritual objects. Davies, Gavin (University of Kentucky), Willem VanEssendelft (Harvard University) and Scott Hutson (University of Kentucky) [38] Migrants or Misers? Investigating function, duration and prosperity at mound groups along the Uci to Kansahcab sacbe in Northern Yucatan The construction of an 18 km long sacbe linking the sites of Uci and Kansacab in Northern Yucatan is hypothesized to have had a range of social, political and economic impacts on communities within its vicinity. In attempting to discern the nature of these impacts, intensive archaeological testing was conducted at several mound groups, including a ballcourt, within Uci`s hinterland. A dearth of ceramics reoriented field methods and suggested unanticipated hypotheses regarding site function, duration, and prosperity. In this paper the authors present spatial patterns in artifact and soil chemistry data and discuss methodology, interpretations and future directions.

Davis, Michael (University of Kansas), Thomas Wake (Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, UCLA) and Tomás Mendizabal (Patronato Panamá Viejo) [67] Towards a settlement chronology for Bocas del Toro, Panama Recent survey and excavation in Bocas del Toro Province, Panama, has provided a great deal of new data concerning settlement patterns and chronology. Approximately 60 ostensibly portable basaltic boulder mortars have been recorded at various localities on Isla Colon, an island with an entirely karstic geology. Many of these artifacts are associated with archaeological deposits of carbon and ceramics. Survey, radiocarbon, and stylistic data are used to refine a settlement chronology for Isla Colon and the surrounding coastal region of Bocas del Toro. Davis, Sara (Archaeological Investigations Northwest, Inc.) [160] Reduction Technologies at the Stockhoff Basalt Quarry in Northeastern Oregon The Stockhoff Basalt Quarry (35UN52) is located on Craig Mountain in northeastern Oregon. Archaeological work conducted in limited portions of the site since the 1950s has documented the quarry`s use as a toolstone resource since the early Holocene. Three excavations in particular have explored the reduction technologies discernible in the artifact assemblages. Recent investigations in 2009 and 2010 provide an extensive look at new data from site 35UN52 and from over 230 newly recorded archaeological sites nearby. These data are analyzed with respect to past studies regarding lithic reduction technologies at this extensive quarry site.

Resources influenced range and movement of people and their geopolitical boundaries were (are) crossed and serviced by trails. Some idea of trail function through time can be gained by characterizing the boundaries within which the trails occur. Forty-four Indian trails were documented that connect places between Yosemite and the Great Basin, provide a non-static look at mountain transportation networks, and for Billy, describe How to Get There From Here.

X-ray diffraction, visual microscopy, and magnetic studies detail the mineralogies of twelve locallyavailable clays from six major geologic surface formations. Methodological protocols were designed to control for particle inclusions and changes in mineralogy resulting from firing and burial environments.

Each day hundreds of undocumented migrants from Latin American attempt to cross into the U.S. on foot through the Sonoran Desert of Arizona. Despite great public and academic interest in this process, little empirical data on the physical act of desert crossing exist. Here we present data from the Undocumented Migration Project, a long-term anthropological study of this clandestine behavior. Using a combination of archaeology, ethnography, GIS, and digital media we employ a phenomenological approach to provide insight into the ways in which migrants experience crossings in Southern Arizona, as well as the archaeological fingerprint that this behavior leaves behind. De Leon, Jason [154] see French, Kirk D. De Lucia, Kristin (Northwestern University) [198] Why households choose to produce surpluses: An Early Postclassic perspective on household strategy and surplus production in Xaltocan, Mexico While archaeologists have traditionally studied surplus to understand the emergence of sociopolitical complexity and social inequality, we must also look at surplus from a bottom up perspective and consider the role of surplus production in ordinary households. This paper looks at small-scale production of craft and food products in Early Postclassic households to understand how commoner households distribute economic resources. Does surplus production result in greater economic or political success for individual households? How does the decision to produce a surplus influence social organization (including gender and age roles) as well as broader economic systems?

employed today by North American archaeologists. It is also commonly held that ethnoarchaeological models are most valuable when they can be linked through historical documentation to past cultures in the same region. The direct historical approach, where applicable, can provide a reliable form of analogical reasoning in ethnoarchaeological studies. This paper uses recent North American case studies to revisit the role of the direct historical approach in ethnoarchaeological research. [10] First Chair Dean, Emily (Katzie Development Corporation) [29] Delineation Of Site Chronology And Spatial Components Using Macroscopic Lithic Analysis At Dhrp52 This presentation summarizes results of a stone tool analysis from site DhRp-52 to determine differences and similarities between its spatial and temporal components. DhRp-52 was an inland/riverine settlement that spanned approximately 2,500 years of occupational history contemporaneous with the Old Cordilleran Culture to the Locarno Beach Phase. My research analyzed tools to distinguish site components and structural features through time and in space, assessed similarities and differences between structures and non-structural areas, evaluated the presence of three temporal components at the site, interpreted site use through assemblage structure variation, and attempted to understand how DhRp-52 fit within the regional chronology. Dean, Emily (Southern Utah University) and Barbara Frank (Southern Utah University) [166] A Public Private Partnership: Community Archaeology at the Little Rabbit Site in Kanab, Utah In 2008 a developer in Kanab, UT contacted us about studying and protecting the Ancestral Pueblo sites on his land. We subsequently collaborated with the landowner and an array of other parties, including the chamber of commerce, local schools, a nonprofit archaeology foundation, the Southern Paiute, and federal and state agencies in order to run an archaeological field school. The resulting project contributed to our understanding of the Virgin Anasazi as well as fostering friendly cooperation between public and private agencies in a region where local distrust of government` is not uncommon. [166] First Chair Dean, Jeffrey (University of Arizona) [199] Environment, Human Behavior, and Demography in the Prehistoric Southwest Archaeological investigation of human ecology involves assessing changing relationships among environment, culture, and demography. To better understand the role of agriculture in these interactions, weaknesses in the study of these processes must be rectified. Among these are problems in reconstructing past environmental variations and relating reconstructions to one another and to past human behavior and demography. Different paleoenvironmental techniques reconstruct different aspects and periodicities of environmental variation that must be reconciled to produce a more complete picture of past environment-agriculture interactions. Furthermore, modern Native populations` apparently anomalous agricultural success must be understood to

fully appreciate prehistoric farming in the region. [99] Discussant Dean, Rebecca [53] Sheep Kills and Shell Counts: The Historical Ecology of Contemporaneous Foragers and Farmers in Neolithic Portugal The Mesolithic to Neolithic transition in Portugal (8,0004,500 cal BC) was protracted and complex, as shellfishing/hunting/gathering societies continued in estuary environments long after farming economies dominated most of the coastal regions of the Iberian peninsula. As seen through the lens of zooarchaeology, the landscape use of foragers in estuaries was radically different from that of farmers farther inland and on rocky coasts. Nonetheless, both farming and foraging societies show similar adaptations, including reliance on wild foods and decreasing foraging efficiency relative to earlier periods. Landscape change ­ possibly anthropogenic ­ led to the eventual abandonment of foraging economies in Portugal. [180] see Lexvold, Angela Deely, A.E [218] see Blackwell, Bonnie A.

Approximately two kilometers inland the Inca constructed a small stone-masonry tambo in the indigenous community. Our research demonstrates Inca success in co-opting and amplifying the local agricultural system. Additionally, the Inca appropriated local ancestors through the introduction of highland chulpas for burial. However, our work also demonstrates the difficulty in discerning how Inca activities altered nonagricultural systems of production and the local political structure. We discuss our preliminary findings from Inca structures, domestic terraces, and tombs. DeFrancisco, Nicole (University of California Riverside) [148] Water, Blood and Life: An analysis of Late Classic lowland Maya water management at the local level While a fair amount of literature documents how the elite Maya at large cities such as Tikal or Copan dealt with issues of water management, little is understood about the way these practices were managed at smaller, rural, farmstead sites. This paper will investigate and analyze the water management practices exhibited by the rural, common ancient Maya during the Late Classic period in the Lowlands when and where land and water resource availability were the scarcest. This paper will also discuss the possible implications of these practices on social and political organization at the local level based on archaeological evidence.

Demarest, Arthur (Vanderbilt University) [116] International Exchange, State Controlled Craft Production and Political Hegemony at Cancuen: Changing Classic Maya Political Economy on the Eve of Collapse In the late eighth century there was a transformation of Cancuen, the great Pasion river port city and highland/lowland gateway. Earlier, more typical, Classic Maya economy, political structure, and residential patterns shifted to internationalism in material culture and long distance exchange, complex political hegemony, a huge administrative/ritual, largely non-residential palace, hyper-segmented lithic production, and direct state or

noble supervision of a jade workshop and of the ports of Cancuen, the latter being the economic engine of this head-of-navigation transport center. New evidence is presented on this eighth century change and its implications for theories of Maya economy and political collapse.

Dennett, Carrie (University of Calgary) and Geoffrey McCafferty (University of Calgary) [183] Pottery and People: Reassessing Social Identity In Pacific Nicaragua Archaeological reconstruction of social identity in preColumbian Pacific Nicaragua has traditionally been based on ethnohistoric sources that suggest Choroteganspeaking groups replaced local indigenous culture with new people, language and material culture ca. A.D. 800. Support for this reconstruction is typically based on the introduction of a white-slipped polychrome tradition that appeared around this time. However, recent research demonstrates that these new styles were likely not the result of aggressive population replacement and far-flung external influences. Instead, these changes seem to be the result of incremental internal development influenced by increased contact and exchange with southeastern Mesoamerican groups, particularly from Honduras.

It has been assumed that the sequential appearance of these technologies observed in Alta California represented a process of invention and innovation encouraged by demographically driven intensification of fishing. New evidence from excavations in Baja California suggest that these technologies have a deeper history along the California coasts and provide alternative models to explain their use at different times and places in the history of maritime adapted populations.

While much is known about the epidemiology of modern strains, the genetics of early pandemics remain a mystery. We present the first successful sequencing of Vibrio cholerae ancient DNA from the 1800s, from alcohol-preserved human medical specimens from mid-19th-century Philadelphia. Our findings reveal the identity of this early pandemic strain. With the advent of new ancient DNA technology, coupled with high-throughput sequencing, genomes of past pandemics are within reach. We analyze our sequences in a phylogenetic framework, offering insights into the evolutionary history of this significant pathogen. DeWitte, Sharon (University at Albany, SUNY) [16] Sex and Frailty: Patterns from Catastrophic and

Recent research suggests that such differentials existed in the past, as prior exposure to physiological stress increased the risk of death for men more than for women during the Black Death (c. 1347-1351). This paper compares the sex patterns of stress and mortality in a catastrophic Black Death cemetery from London to those in an attritional assemblage wherein individuals died from numerous causes. The results, which reveal similarities between the two assemblages, are examined in light of what is known about gendered access to resources in medieval Europe.

The Rift Valley, with a long antiquity of human occupation offers a unique laboratory for examining changing patterns of lithic material procurement and use through time. Though there remain many undocumented and uncharacterized sources of obsidian, preliminary studies have already demonstrated unusual procurement strategies ­ including the use of boats during the Holocene. This paper will review the history of obsidian studies in the Rift Valley and surrounding region and will discuss how lithic sourcing has been used to address questions about cognition and mobility in prehistory.

The historic structures have seen much of this change, many of them being updated with a mixture of modern and historic features.

The Cerén manioc fields were organized by various land-use lines and show evidence of apparently different cultivators. All of the excavated fields had been harvested just prior to the eruption, with a few areas partially replanted. Given such extraordinary preservation, this evidence has the potential to greatly contribute to Maya agricultural studies. [250] Discussant [8] First Chair [8] see Gonlin, Nan Dixon, E.

Dixon, Helen (University of Michigan) [152] Commemoration at Khaldeh: Reconstructing Burial Practices in the Phoenician Homeland Our knowledge of Phoenician mortuary practice is mainly extrapolated from cemetery landscapes in Phoenician / Punic settlements throughout the Mediterranean, despite over 100 years of archaeologically obtained burial evidence from the Phoenician Levantine homeland. The problem is not a dearth of evidence, but obstacles like early record-keeping, political divisiveness, and wardamaged archives. The Khaldeh cemetery, uncovered during the 1960s Beirut airport expansion, contained 422 Iron I-II burials. Though never fully published, and despite data lost to the Lebanese civil war, an investigative analysis of its contents, layout, and evolution can aid in understanding Levantine Phoenician commemoration Dobney, Keith (University of Aberdeen, UK) [126] Big questions and new techniques: The role of zooarchaeology in 21st century research agendas Zooarchaeology is still considered one of the newer disciplines within the multidisciplinarity that is archaeology. A recent revolution in biomolecular and morphometric techniques is providing new opportunities and directions for zooarchaeological research in a way not imagined a decade ago and is challenging traditional views and approaches. There is, however, a growing schism between the so-called "traditional" and the "new" approaches that is in danger of isolating this important discipline from many broader research agendas. This paper aims to discuss this problem, and presents some examples of research which highlights the continuing contribution of zooarchaeology to the "bigger picture".

Dogiama, Triantafyllia (McMaster University) [205] Moving on: evidence for seasonality in Early Neolithic Northern Greece- the case of Mikri Volvi This paper will argue for intermittent site occupation at the settlement of Mikri Volvi, the only Early Neolithic site found in Greek Central Macedonia. The absence of permanent architecture, the differences between curated and expedient chipped stone tools, and the use of largely non-local raw materials suggest that this flat-extended site was not permanently occupied, unlike the long-lived tell sites considered characteristic of this period. If more evidence corroborates this interpretation, then the Early Neolithic must be largely reconceptualized to accommodate the diversity with which the Neolithic people built their lifeworld.

When times were tough the museum was forced to clarify its mission and role at Phillips Academy. Twice in recent years, the museum confronted difficult financial issues while simultaneously trying to develop its educational program. These difficult times helped lay the foundation for the success that the institution enjoys today. In an environment within which frank discussion and innovative ideas can be voiced, the museum is now integrated into the academic program at Phillips. Dojack, Lisa [232] see Graesch, Anthony P. Dolan, Patrick (Washington State University) [232] Rules and Roles: The Scale of Economic Production at Dionisio Point, a Marpole phase Village The degree to which Marpole phase household economic strategies were integrated at the village­level remains unclear; were household labor and resources independent, or were there patterns of resource allocation and labor organization at the village-level? The scale of village-level organization raises the potential for the formation of new social roles based upon increasing material inequality. If such structures are present, the reproduction of social roles that distinguished household leadership is only part of the process of increasing social stratification. I examine these issues via analyses of village economics at the Dionisio Point site. [232] Second Chair [232] Third Organizer Dolan, Sean (New Mexico State University) [62] Evidence for obsidian source variation through time at Kipp Ruin (LA 153465) XRF analysis was performed on obsidian artifacts from Kipp Ruin (LA 153465), a multi-component site in southwestern New Mexico to assess temporal and spatial changes of obsidian sources during the pithouse and pueblo periods. Results show two interesting patterns about the site. 1) Obsidian sourcing varies through time with more sources being utilized during the pueblo period and 2) the occupant`s utilized southern sources less than sources to the north during the pueblo period. This can be attributed to wider kinship ties throughout the Mogollon territory starting around A.D. 1000 when they switched to living in pueblos.

Dolphin, Alexis (The University of Western Ontario), Katharina Lorvik (Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research) and Anna Karin Hufthammer (Bergen Museum) [236] Dental Indicators of Children`s Res ponses to Urbanisation in Early Medieval Bergen, Norway By the 12th and 13th centuries Bergen, Norway, had developed into the first truly international trading centre of Scandinavia and, as such, experienced a relatively rapid period of urbanisation. The effects of such a shift in social organisation may have been felt especially by mothers and children as Norway`s king levied heavy tax and fee burdens on households. An examination of the microstructure of teeth excavated from the St. Mary`s churchyard at Bryggen allows us to draw conclusions regarding the frequency and timing of stressful periods common to children living in Bergen at this time.

Discussion and Interpretation of a Late Classic Archaeological Context from Cueva del Lazo (Chiapas, Mexico) Cueva del Lazo (Chiapas, Mexico) yielded a group of ten children buried in the cave during the Late Classic period. Despite the fact that the context suggests repeated episodes of child sacrifice, no direct evidence of sacrifice was detected neither during excavations nor by the osteological analysis. The paper describes the archaeological context, the associated artefacts (including textiles and other perishable materials) and the results of paleobotanical and bioantropological researches carried by various colleagues in order to reconstruct the ancient ritual event and to propose a possible interpretation of its meaning.

This research is based on analysis of the stratigraphy, radiocarbon dates, and paleoecological indicators (foraminifera, ostracodes, mollusks, diatoms, silicoflagellates, and pollen) of several core samples. Results indicate that sea level rise caused the Ballona to shift from a bay at the mouth of the Los Angeles River to a lagoon by about 6600 B.P. As the Ballona Lagoon filled with sediment, the ecological landscape also changed, providing a variety of resources for human exploitation through the middle- and lateHolocene.

[151] Early Historical Period Gabrielino/Tongva-Hispanic Interaction in the Los Angeles Basin

The early historical period in the Los Angeles Basin was a challenging time for Native Californians. New Hispanic institutions, including missions, pueblos, and ranchos, intruded onto traditional Native lifeways. Native groups like the Gabrielino/Tongva responded to these Hispanic intrusions in a variety of fashions, including becoming incorporated into these new, introduced economies and religious institutions. Our paper discusses these interactions, focusing in part on archaeological data and Mission records associated with the Ballona area, located in west Los Angeles. By doing so, we offer unique clues into these interactions and economic and religious relationships.

In this paper, we explore the effects of this transition on the exploitation of wild foods, particularly the increasing localization of resource collection zones as villagers began to focus more on food production. Taking the Gobnangou escarpment in southeastern Burkina Faso (West Africa) during the late 1st millennium AD as a case study, we examine the shift towards utilization of aquatic resources from local floodplains and seasonal drainages rather than distant permanent river courses.

Duffy, Paul (University of Pittsburgh) [226] Mortuary Practice and Diverging Social Trajectories in Bronze Age Hungary During the Bronze Age on the Great Hungarian Plain, both cremation and inhumation are associated with the development of wealth inequality and complex societies.

The association between cremation and inequality, however, did not hold along the Körös river tributaries, the area of the Ottomány/Otomani culture (2150-1650 BC). This paper traces how cremation may have come to be associated with a de-emphasis on competitive display, differing from the norms of neighboring areas. Dugas, Lisa (Indiana University of Pennsylvania) [209] Searching for Social Identity in Monongahela Bone and Shell Artifacts Archaeologists currently debate the social and ethnic identity of Late Prehistoric Monongahela people. Traditional scholarship divides the Monongahela temporally rather than ethnically, based on regional analyses of lithics and ceramics. Ethnicity is assumed, but seldom explored, and Monongahela bone and shell tools have largely been ignored in these traditional approaches. This study investigates social identity through the analysis of bone and shell implements. In addition to being functional tools, bone and shell artifacts communicate important clues to the group identity of the Monongahela, which contributes to a richer understanding of these people and their traditions.

As a consequence, the Paleoindian period is often discussed as a static cultural unit. Yet, early inhabitants relied heavily on wetland systems that underwent great change. In this paper, we discuss our first attempt to derive expectations for regional land use by modeling the distribution of wetland systems. Lake level geochronology, paleoenvironmental data, and basin geomorphology are used to predict change through time in the locations of areas that would support wetlands. These data are then compared against the archaeological record.

Because of wider political events, the fort eventually was occupied by other European powers, but recent research has focused on the discovery of French structural features, including the palisade wall and a midden associated with a bread oven, thus enabling an overlay of historic maps with a new topographic survey, the detection of other archaeological features, and accurate comparison of successive fortifications.

I explore three contemporaneous early-fourteenth century sites located in the Rio Chama valley on the northwestern frontier of the Tewa traditional homeland.

Ebert, Ginny (University of Pennsylvania) [49] Acllawasi: Structuring Chosen Women in the Inka State State development entails the establishment of a bureaucratic and physical infrastructure linked with transformation of existing social groups and formation of new institutions. In the Inka state, these processes were exemplified by the acllawasi, described by chroniclers as an elite institution of women, the acllas, chosen to perform both religious and secular tasks. Acllawasi also refers to the physical structure housing these women. I integrate a critical reading of the chronicles with spatial and architectural analysis of acllawasi to assess how the scope and variety of tasks the acllas performed advanced ideological, political, and economic goals of the Inka. Echeverria, Jose and Tamara Bray (Wayne State University) [15] At the End of Empire: The Late Imperial Site of IncaCaranqui Located at the northernmost edge of Tawantinsuyu, the site of Inca-Caranqui likely represents the last imperial building event prior to the Spanish Conquest. Ethnohistoric accounts regarding who ordered the construction of this site and why are conflicting with some attributing it to Huayna Capac for commemorative purposes, and others to Atahualpa in preparation for his coronation. Recent investigations at the site have focused on documenting the different construction episodes, determining site function, and ascertaining the nature of Inca-local relations via architectural, geochemical, distributional, compositional, and stylistic analyses. In this paper we present some of our recent findings and preliminary interpretations. Eckert, Suzanne (Texas A&M University) [264] When is a polychrome? Slips, self-slips, and surfaces during the Pueblo IV period. Slip color is one of the defining characteristics of ceramic types across the Pueblo IV landscape. Over the past few decades many researchers have interpreted slip color as indicating ethnicity, kinship, religious practice or other social groupings. Few researchers, however, have questioned how slip color is used as an archaeological attribute. This paper considers whether or not slip color is characterized similarly across decorated types, and attempts to address whether or not the number of slip colors defined by archaeologists on decorated pottery are the same number of colors recognized by the producers and users of those pots.

Edwards, Matt (HDR and UCSB), Katharina Schreiber (UCSB) and Craig Smith (UCSB) [229] Wari Enclaves, Local Emulation, and Interregional Exchange: The Dynamics of Culture Contact in the Central Andes during the Middle Horizon As the other contributions to this symposium suggest, culture contact occurs under a wide variety of processes that, in turn, shape how people from different cultural traditions interact with one another as well as how such contact changes the internal dynamics of the societies involved. Culture contact that results from imperial expansion, as occurred during the Andean Middle Horizon (AD 750 - 1000) and the expansion of the Wari polity, can create an ethnic mosaic that results from the administrative needs of the dominant polity as well as the resulting interregional interaction that is caused and/or mediated by imperial expansion.

Both sites are located in terrace sediments of the Debed and appear to have suffered little post-depositional disturbance. At Bagratashen 1, test excavations have revealed a dense (126 finds/cubic meter) and wellpreserved lithic collection from a discrete horizon. Typologically, the lithics signal a late Middle Paleolithic occupation. A handaxe discovered during surface survey may indicate a Late Acheulean component as well. At Ptghavan 4, a dense, in situ Middle Paleolithic assemblage that likely predates the occupation at Bagratashen 1 has been recovered. Ehrich, Richard (German Archaeological Institute Eurasia Department) [23] The Neolithic Age in Sichuan When two huge Bronze Age hoards where discovered at Sanxingdui in 1986, it lead to what could be called a boom` in prehistoric archaeology, mainly in Sichuan but also in other parts of Southwest China. However, only when it became clear in 1995 that the walled enclosures still visible in the Chengdu Basin are in fact Neolithic, did research into these earlier periods increased drastically. Today new phenomena are uncovered at a staggering rate, though many questions remain unresolved. This paper thus summarily presents the current state of research into the Neolithic Age in Sichuan. Eidsness, Janet (THPO Blue Lake Rancheria, California) [239] Context of Place: Behind the Redwood Curtain, North Coastal California California`s North Coast Region may appear to be geographically isolated due to its rugged terrain and lack of major highways. Its prehistoric archaeology infers a long record of habitation, climatic shifts, immigrations and shifts in exchange networks, changes in settlement/ subsistence strategies, growth of large semi-sedentary hunter-gather populations, and development of complex Indian cultures. This paper will introduce its geographic setting, historic and contemporary tribes, give a brief history of past research, and identify a few challenges, to provide a contextual framework for recent research presented in this symposium and to offer ideas for future focused research. Eiselt, B. Sunday (Southern Methodist University) and John Ives (University of Alberta) [17] Kinship--The Unattended Dimension of Paleoindian Studies Paleoindian colonization is typically modeled as biological population fissioning or with unwarranted assumptions about social organization and demographic parameters. Yet meaningful inferences can be made about Paleoindian kinship, with profound settlement implications. Paleoindian peoples were undoubtedly

aware of critical, kin-structured options for managing the sociogeographic boundary at which marriages could occur in small group sizes and extremely low population densities. By adopting this perspective, we provide alternative explanations to better apprehend enigmatic aspects of the Paleoindian record, including differential demographic success for colonization episodes, shifting styles of colonization, and social dimensions signaled by the spread of fluted point technology.

Recent archaeological research in the Río Champotón drainage suggests that military success may have played a central role in the earlier history of Chakanputun. This paper reviews new evidence for military conflict in the consolidation of power and rise to regional prominence by the ancient city of Chakanputun during the Postclassic Period. Elder, J.

Wood remains tend to be under-analyzed and their important role in human ecology and economies is minimized. Yet, detailed analysis of wood's anatomical features, its annual growth-rings, and the cut marks left on its surface, among others, can provide rich bodies of data about past environment and societies. In this paper, we review the diverse range of methods and problem orientations that have developed in wood studies and how they improve our understandings of ancient societies.

A Multidisciplinary Reevaluation of the Date of the Eruption of Sunset Crater Volcano, Northern Arizona In 1958, Terah Smiley suggested that Sunset Crater Volcano erupted in A.D. 1064, a date now entrenched in the literature and important in reconstructing prehistoric human response to the eruption. The 1064 date was based on the initiation of suppressed and complacent tree rings from several beams used in the construction of the 100-room Wupatki Pueblo, ~20 km northeast of Sunset Crater. Recent multidisciplinary studies using chemical assays and tree-ring morphology indicate that this date may not be accurate. In this paper we present evidence suggesting that it is more probable that Sunset Crater erupted in the A.D. 1080s. [99] First Chair Elston, Robert (University of Nevada) [230] Washoe Archaeology Redux In the mid to late 1960s I was first a graduate student of Wilbur (Buck) Davis at University of Nevada, Reno working on his Washoe Archaeology project investigating the prehistory of the Washoe Indians of the eastern Sierra Nevada, and later, Robert Stephenson`s assistant in the newly formed Nevada Archeological Survey. The Nevada-Berkeley archaeology axis was very strong then. The Washoe archaeology project was stimulated by previous research of UC Berkeley archaeologists Robert Heizer and Albert Elsasser who offered interest and encouragement to Buck and me. Robert Stephenson provided support to Billy Clewlow and Richard Cowan during their initial Black Rock Desert sojourn. I was fortunate to meet, interact with, and be influenced by all of the Berkeley graduate students working in the Great Basin at the time, including Billy with whom I have since shared overlapping research areas and interests (Black Rock Desert, Grass Valley, China Lake/Coso).

[178] Late Holocene Increases in Artiodactyl Populations in the Columbia Basin: A Case Study from the Sanders Site, Southcentral WA The Sanders site faunal assemblage provides a test of data patterns noted by other researchers in the western United States suggesting climate change promoted improved artiodactyl habitat and population increases after about 4500 BP. This increased prey availability may have played an important role in the transition from mobile foragers to logistically oriented collectors in the Columbia Basin. The assemblage has the potential to provide significant paleoenvironmental, taphonomic, and subsistence data on the late Holocene inhabitants of the Columbia Basin during a time of increasing cultural complexity. Endo, Naoko, Rebecca Wigen (Pacific Identifications Inc.), Louise Williams (Simon Fraser University), Suzanne Villeneuve (Simon Fraser University) and Brian Hayden (Simon Fraser University) [176] Examining Shifts in Subsistence Patterns throughout the Evolution of Keatley Creek Resource intensification and diversification have been key issues in understanding the conditions surrounding the emergence and collapse of aggregated villages in the Mid-Fraser Region. Recent research at Keatley Creek has resulted in large datasets of faunal and botanical data from varied contexts spanning all major occupation periods, from early village formation to the protohistoric period. These data, combined with new radiocarbon dates, provide an ideal dataset for addressing questions of shifts in subsistence due to environmental changes as well as intensification and diversification. Endo, Naoko [176] see Billy, Nora Eng, Jacqueline (Western Michigan University) and Vanchigdash Mergen (National University of Mongolia) [236] Health of Xiongnu and Mongol Period populations: a bioarchaeological analysis of pastoral populations from two ancient Mongolian empires Mongolia has been the home of many pastoral cultures, including several nomadic confederacies that developed into powerful empires. Two of the most well known are the Xiongnu, who clashed often with China`s early dynasties, and the Mongol Empire, who over a millennia later conquered throughout Eurasia. Bioarchaeological comparisons of skeletal collections deriving from these two different periods of empire suggest that despite the hundreds of years separating them, and the probable attendant changes in the types of stresses, people from these pastoral populations nevertheless grew to similar statures and experienced similar susceptibility to health problems including fractures and dental disease.

This paper will present recent evidence for agricultural origins and landscape modifications that accompanied the emergence of complex societies in Mesoamerica. Not only were plants brought into domesticated cultivation systems over an approximately 10,000 year period, but also forests were restructured to provide optimum productivity to meet human needs.

[157] First Chair Englehardt, Joshua [157] see Carrasco, Michael D. Ensor, Bradley (Eastern Michigan University) [51] The Crafting of Maya Kinship Past studies of prehispanic Maya Kinship include problematic assumptions: that a pan-Maya system existed, that naming and term systems predict social organization, that kinship is static, that different classes have the same system, and that archaeological data are too "limited". Political economic theory views kinship as dynamic, malleable, and variable by class. Three classes at the Late Classic period Islas de Los Cerros demonstrate distinct kinship behavior explained by their context in the political economy. Rather than fitting problematic ethnohistoric models to archaeological data, archaeology is actually better equipped to develop models for prehispanic Maya kinship. Erb-Satullo, Nathaniel (Harvard University), Andrew Shortland (Cranfield University) and Katherine Eremin (Harvard University Art Museum) [5] Local Wares, Imperial Styles: Identifying Nuzi Ware Production Sites in the Near East through Petrography and Chemical Analysis The production and consumption of elite material culture in the Near Eastern Late Bronze Age (c. 1600-1200 BC) has long been an area of scholarly interest. Nuzi ware, a white-on-dark painted ceramic associated with the Mitanni Empire, appeared at this time. Stylistic analysis is ambiguous about whether these ceramics were imported from the empire`s core, or whether production occurred locally among imperial vassals. Optical petrography provides a new perspective on this question, comparing mineralogy of the ceramics with local geology. Coupled with chemical analysis, this technique furnishes a means of distinguishing between production centers. Eremin, Katherine [5] see Erb-Satullo, Nathaniel L.

Erlandson, Jon (University of Oregon) [11] California Archaeology: A View from the Sea Less than 50 years ago, California archaeology was seen through a terrestrial lens, with Paleoindian or Milling Stone peoples migrating from interior regions to the coast, where they gradually adapted to life by the sea. Today a growing body of data suggest just the opposite, with sophisticated maritime peoples colonizing the coast and Channel Islands very early, then migrating up river valleys into the interior. A new view proposes that the Paleocoastal and Western Pluvial Lakes traditions are closely linked to a coastal migration from northeast Asia to the Americas. What followed is reviewed through an aquatic lens. [263] see Bond, Kristina J [263] see Willis, Lauren M. [123] see Braje, Todd J.

Due to a number of unique geological features, Sitio Drago, Northern Panama, offers excellent preservation for human and faunal remains, thus allowing for strong bioarchaeological analysis to be performed in the goal of ascertaining past subsistence patterns and their effects on health status. In this poster, the use of dental pathology analysis and comparison at Sitio Drago will be the focus of my research presentation. Eschbach, Krista (Arizona State University) and Alanna Ossa (Arizona State University) [216] Archaeological Data Curation and the Use of Legacy Databases A common problem for legacy research is that data are often organized by artifact storage location rather than archaeological provenience, making future research difficult. Undocumented changes in data and loss of original organizational strategies can further compromise accessibility and integrity. Based on our experiences in curation and research analyses, we propose specific methods to make archaeological data curation and legacy use as flexible and useful as possible. This paper will deal with overcoming difficulties associated with the use of legacy databases and curation procedures that can increase the accessibility of archaeological and historical data for future research.

Locus A/R is an open-air, single-component Western Stemmed Tradition site within the Fire Creek National Register Archaeological District in the Central Great Basin. Twelve fragmented basalt stemmed points were recovered from surface and subsurface contexts, most within a discrete concentration. Low power microscopy is employed to identify post-break use-wear and examine burin scars and breakage patterns to help determine tool and overall concentration function. Geochemical characterization provides the locations of toolstone sources, enhancing our understanding of the Prearchaic lithic terrane for this area. Preliminary results suggest this concentration may have served as more than just a discard and rehafting/retooling location. Estes, Mark [61] see Cunnar, Geoffrey E.

This paper examines the role that the colonial Indian slave trade played in the transformation of the Mississippian world during the first 150 years of European contact. The paper tracks the intensification of slave raiding for Indian slaves to sell to European merchants by Indian slavers, the subsequent dissolution of chiefdoms and dislocation of the people, and it begins to sketch the early coalescence of the Indian nations of the colonial American South.

Evans, Adrian (University of Bradford) [59] Learning from Blind Tests: Advancing the Technique Step by Step A technique developed over 30 years ago is still being confidently used today, mostly without any significant modification. However, since its inception there have been many criticisms, originating from different perspectives, which have questioned the validity of the results it is used to produce. As part of the proofing several blind tests have been conducted, showing variable results. This paper presents these studies from a

different angle and suggests that these, and future tests like them, should be used constructively to advance the technique. Examples are given of how this might progress and the potential benefit that this may have. [59] Second Organizer Evans, Adrian [59] see Donahue, Randolph E.

Charcoal was not present in cores taken from the surrounding areas, suggesting two discrete occurrences of fire. Preliminary 14C analyses indicate that the inshore charcoal unit dates to ~9,500 years BP; the charcoal unit from the deeper core is awaiting results.

The Point Community sites contain numerous human burials and associated grave goods. In this study, I will compare the burials of the Point Community sites to those of Aztec Ruins, Salmon Ruin, and Chaco Canyon, illustrating the outlier status of the Point Community.

An omichicahuastli found in the Aztec village of Cihuatecpan, near Otumba (Postclassic and Early Colonial periods) is analyzed in terms of cultural and locational contexts, which reveal its sacred associations. Buried deep in a midden, it was well hidden from the vigilance of Colonial period authorities intent on eradicating traditional practices. Unlike many omichicahuastlis that were made of human femurs, the Cihuatecpan example is tapir bone, documenting interaction with the tropical lowlands.

As part of an interdisciplinary research project on indigenous landscape management, our research team collected ~150 soil column samples from Quiroste Valley on California`s central coast, including a Late Period archaeological site and transects on the valley floor. Data analysis combined morphologybased phytolith classification with computer-assisted 3-D image analysis techniques to improve phytolith discrimination of plant taxa. In this paper we present preliminary phytolith data from Quiroste Valley and discuss the potential for expanding archaeological phytolith research in California.

Faucher, Anne-Marie (Universite Laval, Quebec) [25] Evolution wood procurement: a Middle Iron Age to Late Norse case study, Everley Broch, Caithness Everley Broch is composed of a Middle Iron Age broch and a Late Norse house. Local gathering of roundwood, short-distance timber trade within the mainland and collection of driftwood are the main wood procurement strategies attested. It is proposed that a long-distance trade network was established during the Norse period as a fourth wood supply strategy. Within a wider Atlantic Scotland framework, as the site is located on the Scottish mainland where more timber is available, driftwood does not seem to have been as important as for the other Atlantic Scotland regions.

The research was focused on identifying and characterizing the Late Classic (A.D. 500-900) and Early Postclassic (A.D. 900 1300) components of the site, which coincide with the devolution and regeneration of complex society within the Valley of Oaxaca.

Fauvelle, Mikael (University of California, San Diego) [186] Economic Complexity at La Blanca: Feasting, Craft Specialization, and Domestic Production As we expand our understanding of the evolution of early complex society it is important to maintain a focus not only on political inequality, but also on the development of intermediate economic systems. At La Blanca, uniformity in ceramic vessel distributions between households suggests that commoners and elites shared access to the same sources of ceramic production. This pattern is at odds with redistributional economic models commonly associated with chiefdoms in neoevolutionary theory. This paper will examine these ceramic distributions and suggest that economic exchange at La Blanca may have been more complex than commonly assumed for the Middle Preclassic.

Rich in Paleoindian resources and well-known locally, until recently Mud Lake has received little academic attention. Utilizing new data from pedestrian survey and existing environmental reconstructions, I consider how, when, and why groups visited Mud Lake during the late Pleistocene-early Holocene and place these occupations within the broader context of Paleoindian research in the Great Basin.

Recent analysis of the lithic assemblage from the site of Strath Bogue in Northern Belize has revealed interesting patterns of production, consumption, curation, and recycling. These data reveal significant information concerning the re-settlement and regeneration of this Terminal Classic migrant community as they contended with the collapse of large states in the central Maya Lowlands. The results of this analysis have implications for understanding the draw of the Progresso Lagoon region during this period of societal change, as well its place within changing inter and intra-regional economic systems in the aftermath of the collapse. Ferguson, T (University of Arizona) [130] Discussant [1] Discussant [197] Discussant Ferring, Reid (University of North Texas) [114] Archaeological Evidence from Dmanisi, Georgian Caucasus, for the Earliest Occupations of Eurasia Recent excavations in the M5 sector of Dmanisi show that the site was first occupied ca. 1.85 Ma, and that it was visited repeatedly for over 80 Kyr prior to accumulation of the early Homo erectus fossils, dated to ca. 1.77 Ma. Artifact analyses reveal apparent changes in occupational intensity, raw material procurement and artifact function. Dmanisi's archaeological record thus reveals the presence of a well-established population, not transitory colonists. Moreover, Dmanisi's long formation history of serial occupations is comparable to those of much younger Paleolithic sites, provoking speculations on the subsistence strategies of early Homo in temperate Eurasia. Ferris, Jennifer (Washington State University) and William Andrefsky, Jr. (Washington State University) [160] Chert Toolstone Provenance, Availability, and Social Geographic Systems in the Owyhee Uplands Toolstone sources, distribution, and quarry locations are extremely important for understanding prehistoric landuse strategies. While igneous rocks are routinely assayed geochemically, chert and other silicified rocks of sedimentary origin are seldom evaluated, and if they are, generally produce nondiagnostic chemical results. However, in the Owyhee Uplands, chert genesis is diverse and variable due to unique formation contexts. In this paper, we show first that it is possible to obtain locationally diagnostic geochemical signatures in such contexts. Second, we investigate how these results can inform about the social geographic system existing within this landscape. Ferris, Neal (University of Western Ontario) [55] Viewed From The Edge: An Archaeological Borderland During Early Ancestral Northern Iroquoian Archaeology Northern Iroquoian archaeology is often read linearly: ancient communities progressing inevitably towards historic agriculturalist entities. But life lived can be less certain of ultimate outcomes. Insight into how contingent social innovation experienced in this region was arises from patterns seen on the periphery of harder archaeological traditions. One such borderland adjacent to northern Iroquoian archaeology was a landscape of tradition and innovation, where communities of a distinct archaeological tradition materially negotiated internal and external social forces. Contingency, experimentation,

unintended consequences and agency all shaped life in a borderland and at the periphery during the rise of northern Iroquoian cultural patterns. Ferris, Neal [197] see Welch, John R.

This study assesses whether it is possible to reliably characterize and distinguish material from two prehistorically quarried vesicular basalt sources along the middle Gila River in central Arizona. Compositional data for source samples and archaeological specimens are gathered using a Bruker Tracer III-V portable spectrometer. Statistical analyses are employed to assess geochemical variation among the material sources. The results of the study have implications for Hohokam material provisioning strategies, currently predominated by ceramic and obsidian studies. Fertelmes, Craig [193] see Kelly, Sophia E.

These Clovis-era dates range between 10,900 and 11,050 rcbp. This plateau effect has obvious implications for the rate and direction of Paleoindian migration, the ostensible synchrony of earliest occupations of North and South America, and megafaunal extinction.

Archaeological research in the park has yielded fossilized teeth, shell, and wood in archaeological assemblages, and recent consultation with Native American tribes indicates that fossils continue to have cultural significance to descendant communities. This research integrates archaeological and ethnographic data in order to elucidate the role of paleontological resources in the cultural history and material worlds of Puebloan groups, and to explore management strategies that accommodate the dual identity of fossils as natural and cultural resources.

These studies fail to consider the biocultural complexity contributing to patterns of violence. Here, we utilize an expanded definition of burial taphonomy, considering body decomposition, to test if individuals exhibiting trauma differ in identifiable ways in an early farming community from the Sonoran Desert (circa 2,000-4,000 ybp). A variable matrix is constructed to examine demography, decomposition, postdepositional taphonomic processes, health status, and mortuary treatment. Although numerous community members experienced violence, we suggest specific individuals were selected for differential mortuary treatment as a form of postmortem signaling. Fields, Shawn and Eleanor King (Howard University) [138] Unearthing the History of a Ghost Town: A Report on Recent Excavations at Hermosa In the 2010 field season the Gila Archaeological Project conducted a GPR survey followed by excavations in the northwest part of the site of Hermosa, a former mining town now abandoned. These excavations painted very different pictures of how that part of the site was used. While the northernmost excavation yielded many domestic remains, the second one, located east of a fire feature--a possible hearth, contains what appears to be the edge of a charcoal pit. This poster will compare and contrast the two excavations and explore the function of the features and open spaces they are associated with. Fierer-Donaldson, Molly (Harvard University)

[128] Teotihuacan Warrior Costumes in Classic Maya Tombs Understanding the nature of interaction between the Maya and Teotihuacan has engaged scholars for decades. At the Maya site of Copan, Honduras, royal and elite burials from the Early Classic period have been found containing items described as part of a Teotihuacan Warrior Costume. Previous analysis focused on the objects as evidence of a relationship with Teotihuacan. Now, however, multiple tombs, including one in 2008, have been excavated containing pieces of this regalia. Taken together these contexts can begin to explain why there are individuals buried at a Maya site with the military dress of a foreign city.

It is suggested that the creation of shared images of the body and specific social skins allowed for the reproduction of political hierarchies. A certain corpus of motifs is clearly related to the local ideational sphere whereas the incorporation of foreign forms and different styles was used as a means of power accretion.

Fisher, Jacob (CSU-Sacramento) [255] Climate Change, Isotopes, and Mountain Sheep Hunting at Five Finger Ridge, Utah At Five Finger Ridge, a Fremont site in central Utah, the relative abundance of mountain sheep (Ovis canadensis) decreased during a period of increased summer temperatures. I use stable isotopes (strontium, oxygen, and carbon) to test whether this reduction resulted from increased opportunity costs relating to maize horticulture or shifting geographic ranges of sheep populations. The data show that sheep were acquired from new locations and consumed a larger quantity of C4 grasses during this period. The implications of these findings are significant both for our understanding of Fremont foraging and for understanding mountain sheep responses to climate change. Fisher, Philip (Washington State University) and Kathryn Harris (Washington State University) [257] A New Measure of Curation for North American Hafted Bifaces Determining the amount of curation stone tools have undergone is essential to understanding a tools use-life. A number of indices have been developed to measure curation and retouch of stone tools. However, the application of these measures to North American hafted bifaces is problematic. The Thickness Index of Reduction was developed and tested by analyzing three hafted bifaces after identical stages of use and retouch to assess its applicability on hafted bifaces from the archaeological record.

In both regions intensification precedes the emergence of some marked social complexities by significant intervals. Because many models predict social competition and complexity to emerge rapidly from

resource intensification, delays of 500-1000 years in social response indicate the need for better understanding of the processes involved. This issue is explored by means of case comparison.

Due to specific histories of fieldwork, and relationships to traditional histories, it is instructive to examine how archaeology emerged and developed in specific regions.

At the same time, new forms of Buddhism (Mahayana and Vajrayana) emerged and became established in South Asia.

[153] Maya Population and the Traditional Maya MilpaForest Garden It is received wisdom that the Maya destroyed their environment to produce sufficient maize for their population.

[110] Discussant Fortin, Louis (Washington State Univ.) [257] Lithic Investigations and Spatial Patterning in the Moquegua Valley, Peru The preliminary study looks to discern the spatial variability in lithic material procured and utilized within the Moquegua Valley during the Middle Horizon (A.D. 600 ­ 1000). During the Middle Horizon both Wari and Tiwanaku state-level societies occupied the valley. This study addresses site locations and their relation to lithics by incorporating a number of spatial statistical analyses. The significance of site clustering can be identified through methods such as spatial autocorr elaton (Moran`s I) and multi-distance analysis (Ripley`s K). In addition, the integration of a least-cost path model will aid in identifying potential routes utilized to acquire lithic resources. Foster, John (California State Parks/ Indiana University), K. Harley McDonald (Indiana University), Charles Beeker (Indiana University) and Geoffrey Conrad (Indiana University) [260] Let There Be Light in the Dark Zone: Insights into Taíno Cave Paintings in the Eastern Dominican Republic The Taíno culture area features some of the most numerous Dark Zone paintings in North America, yet major questions remain about their origin, chronology and purpose. This paper examines characteristics of the Jose-Maria style pictographs from several major limestone cavern sites in eastern Hispanola and presents the first radiocarbon dates from pigments in Cueva del Puente in the East National Park. Initial dates imply the elaborate rock art style may precede development of Classic Taíno culture in the area. Implications for future research are presented. Foster, John [69] see Conrad, Geoffrey W. Foster, Joshua [244] Mimbres Mortar Holes, what were there purpose? Bedrock grinding features are commonly associated with multi-component sites in the Mimbres Valley of southwest New Mexico. Most known clusters are associated with hard bedrock substrates and archaeologists assume they were used to grind seeds such as mesquite beans. Recent excavations at the Kipp Ruin on the lower Mimbres River, however, have

revealed dozens of these features excavated into softer bedrock caliche suggesting alternative functions. Were these features all used for processing food? Or were they postholes for as yet unrecognized structures (ramadas, raised granaries, shallow pit houses or stockades)? This paper presents a functional analysis of these features. Foster, Thomas (Univ. of West Georgia) and Matthew Boehm (University of Tennessee) [240] An analysis of Native American trade from factory records of the early nineteenth century in Georgia We conducted an analysis of economic transaction records from the Fort Wilkinson Factory Stores in central Georgia in an attempt to understand trade behaviors by the Native Americans of the southeastern United States. Between February 4, 1804 and November 29, 1806, Factory personnel recorded 2,168 trade transactions. During this period, 38,226.5 deerskins and skins, 482 hides and rawhides, and 569 furs entered Fort Wilkinson. We analyze the month by month trends in exchange and compare the trade good assemblages to archaeological sites that represent Creek occupations that date to the same time period in Georgia and Alabama. Fournier, Patricia (Escuela Nacional de Antropologia e Historia) and M. James Blackman (Smithsonian Institution) [200] Indigenous Post-conquest Ceramics from MexicoTenochtitlan and Tlatelolco: Technological and Stylistic Syncretism As Thomas H. Charlton emphasized is his research, the persistence of indigenous material culture is evident in the Basin of Mexico during the Early Colonial period, both in the capital of the viceroyalty where most of the European settlers lived and in the neighboring Indian town of Tlatelolco. Based on the study of ceramic collections, this paper shows that in the case of orange, red and glazed wares dating to the Early Colonial period, Late Aztec traditions took on new technological and stylistic forms with innovative and hybridized values to suit the needs of the moment in Colonial society.

[21] see Mondragon, Lourdes Fowler, Adriane (AECOM) [50] Evaluating Historic Setting Integrity of National Historic Trails Evaluating the historic settings of long linear historic sites such as trails presents many challenges and requires a careful balanced approach taking into account both the fine-grained artifacts of the trail as well as its relationship to the broad context and surroundings. This paper discusses the development of a methodology for documenting and evaluating historic setting integrity for National Historic Trails that can be applied to other linear historic sites. A National Park Service cultural landscapes approach was customized and coordinated with both visual resource and cultural resource inventories to evaluate the trail setting`s integrity from an historical perspective.

Discussant Fowler, William (Vanderbilt University) [200] Archaeological Approaches to Indigenous Culture Change in Colonial El Salvador Results of two major historical archaeological projects directed by the author in El Salvador are presented, and the influence of Thomas Charlton's work in central Mexico on the research design of these projects is discussed. The Izalcos Archaeological Project was regional in scope and studied indigenous culture change in the long term during the Colonial period and especially in the sixteenth century. The Ciudad Vieja Archaeological Project focused on a single site, the Conquest town of San Salvador, and project members have studied the impact of conquest and indigenous responses in the region within a relatively short span. Fowles, Severin (Barnard College, Columbia University) [53] The Art of War in Eighteenth Century Taos Against the popular image of Native Americans as cold societies slavishly following tradition, the adoption of the horse by indigenous communities on the Plains and in the eastern Great Basin presents us with one of the most profound examples of self-authored cultural transformation. In the decades following the horse`s introduction, tribes such as the Ute, Apache, and Comanche refashioned themselves as equestrian warrior societies with remarkable geopolitical influence across central North America. Here, I report on a newly discovered rock art tradition in northern New Mexico that serves as an elaborate archive of these dynamic and militarily potent societies. [211] see Wilkinson, Darryl A. Frachetti, Michael (Washington University) [54] Expanding worlds and local Bronze Age communities along the Inner Asian Mt. Corridor The second millennium BC has been defined as a period of unprecedented expansion in communication and interaction across Central Eurasia. By comparison, the third millennium BC has remained relatively unknown, largely due to limited archaeological evidence. For this reason, communities have been conceived as isolated in this time period. This paper presents new archaeological evidence and recent discoveries from the formative third millennium in Inner Asia, to illustrate the incipient stages of interaction that extended widely across Eurasia linking domestic economies from China to SW Asia. Franco, Teresa (Vanderbilt University) [233] Chinchorro Maritime Foragers in the Coastal Camarones Valley of Northern Chile: Seasonality and Paleocology The Chinchorro culture of the north coast of Chile (70003500 BP) is best known for its maritime economy and mummification of the dead. Not known is how the Chinchorro people articulated with and managed both the maritime and desert coast of the region to develop their complex culture. This poster presents growth-ring and isotope analyses of marine shells (Concholepas concholepas) from the coastal site of Camarones-14 to document occupational seasonality. Identifying the seasonality of shellfish contributes to our understanding of Chinchorro mobility/sedentism and early cultural

complexity Frank, Barbara [166] see Dean, Emily M. Franklin, Elaine (Western Carolina University) [268] Discussant Franklin, Kathryn (University of Chicago) [140] Making a Space of Trade in the Medieval Armenian Highlands: An Integrated Approach to Political Economy and Landscape This paper presents the results of archeological and historical research on the political economy of the Armenian highlands in the context of long distance trade during the medieval period (600- 1400 AD). Systematic survey in the Kasakh valley of northern Armenia has provided singular insights into the spatiality of longdistance trade relationships and local sovereignty. Historical discourses from the period suggest that social actors in the highlands participated in and produced a particular conceptual world through interaction and exchange. This paper examines the archaeological landscape as the intersection both between historical discourses about place and past material practice, as well as between the local and large-scale. Franklin, Reno (Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation) [1] Discussant Franz, Ingmar [26] see Biehl, Peter F. Frederick, Gay [232] see Coupland, Gary Freeburg, Adam (University of Washington) and Shelby Anderson (University of Washington) [159] Cape Krusenstern Revisited The collection of high resolution spatial data at Cape Krusenstern allows precise and efficient mapping of archaeological features and collection locations across the beach ridge complex. By establishing spatial and chronological relationships between new data and those published by Giddings and Anderson (1986) we are able to build on previous work, broadening understanding of Arctic culture evolution of the late Holocene. Here, we consider new findings ­including faunal data and feature locations­from well known settlements at the Cape and discuss their contribution toward our understanding of human-environmental dynamics in the Arctic. Freeburg, Adam [263] see Anderson, Shelby L. R. Freeman, Jacob (Arizona State University) [36] Patterns of Crop Species Richness in Agricultural Systems: Implications for the intensification of farming This poster presents patterns of crop species richness in subsistence level agricultural systems at a global scale. It is argued that commitment to farming primarily restricts crop species richness. However, once a threshold in commitment to farming is crossed, crop species richness is primarily constrained by the Holocene climate and evolutionary history of domesticated plant lineages. The implications of this argument for patterns of change in agricultural societies is discussed, and trade offs between resource diversity in foraging and farming systems are explored.

Late and Terminal Classic nobles interred with non-local artifacts each had local strontium values. Local values also are present for a revered ancestor at Cahal Pech, who received unusual burial treatment. Other atypical burial patterns, suggestive of sacrifice, were linked to five individuals at Xunantunich with non-local Central Peten-like strontium values. Burial treatment and grave goods serve as complex statements of political relationships rather than simple indicators of origin. French, Kirk (Pennsylvania State University) and Jason De Leon (University of Michigan) [154] Sleeping with the Enemy: A Lesson in Archaeological Ethics and Television Production This paper provides an overview of the encounter between two academic archaeologists and a media production company interested in creating a non-fiction, reality based, television show. The intent was to produce a fast-paced, entertaining, and educational program with the goals of altering the public perception of archaeology and highlighting the importance of archaeological conservation. The authors` found themselves unprepared for a persistent battle of balancing entertainment and archaeological ethics in the world of corporate television. Here we share our learning experiences as a cautionary tale to those who may find themselves in similar situations. [154] First Chair Freund, Kyle (McMaster University), Tristan Carter (McMaster University) and Daniel Contreras (Stanford University) [63] Ancient Obsidian Exploitation in the Mediterranean: Giali Reexamined The archaeological importance of obsidian from the Greek island of Giali during the Mesolithic through Bronze Ages is relatively minimal when compared with other eastern Mediterranean sources. Through the use of x-ray fluorescence technology (EDXRF) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), this project chemically characterizes geological samples from Giali obtained during the summer 2010 field season, explores the geological history of the island, and situates it within a larger spatial and cultural framework. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the various contexts under which ancient obsidian exploitation occurred, both on Giali and throughout the eastern

Mediterranean. Friberg, Christina (American Museum of Natural History) [193] Shell Sourcing with pXRF: Elemental analysis of archaeological shell Shell sourcing projects demonstrate that no matter where a shell artifact is found--whether a trade good or an object of local manufacture--its chemical composition will be a clue to its original source within a regional context. This preliminary study takes a closer look at the difference in shell chemistry between estuarine and saltwater marsh bivalves as well as how shell chemistry changes temporally. This paper presents the chemical analysis of archaeological and modern shells, which evaluates X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry as a nondestructive method for shell sourcing and the implications for future studies on shell artifact trade. Fridberg, Diana (Washington University in St. Louis) and David Freidel (Washington University in St. Louis) [157] Thinking about Turtles at El Perú-Waka`, Petén Mary Pohl`s melding of zooarchaeology and iconography to interpret animal meanings is one of her enduring contributions to Maya archaeology. In this spirit, we investigate the roles of Testudines. The site of El PerúWaka` is located in the Maya Biosphere Reserve, a region home to numerous species of symbolic and economic importance to the ancient Maya. We discuss the importance of turtles to the ancient residents of El Perú as revealed by zooarchaeological and iconographic analyses. These lines of evidence sustain the argument that at El Perú turtles were not only good to eat, but good to think. Friedman, Elizabeth (Illinois Institute of Technology), Lynn Swartz Dodd (University of Southern California), Carlo Segre (Illinois Institute of Technology), Sarah Butler (University of Southern California) and Jon Almer (Argonne National Laboratory) [220] Arrowheads and Projectile Points from the Ancient Middle East: Indicators of Regional Metalworking Tradition and Imposed Imperial Demand. Copper alloy projectile points from five ancient sites (Tayinat, Judaidah, Çatal Höyük, Megiddo and Persepolis) are examined to provide information on technological organization and provisioning systems of the Assyrian and Persian empires. Synchrotron-radiation x-rays facilitate non-destructive bulk elemental analysis and phase characterization. This permits comparison of metal industries during periods of local hegemony and imperial socio-political control, providing crucial empirical data that enable us to address questions for which only partial and largely unreliable data are available. The interdisciplinary team of scientists relies on collaboration with archaeologists Heather Snow [Tayinat], Marina Pucci [Çatal Höyük], and epigrapher Matthew Stolper [Persepolis].

Norman (University of Toronto) [159] Migration and privation: a short-term Thule Inuit occupation at the Pembroke site, Victoria Island The Pembroke site, on Victoria Island in arctic Canada, is the earliest Thule site yet identified in its region. Several lines of evidence indicate a very brief occupation, and as such the site appears to have been occupied by Thule people in the process of migrating. In this paper, faunal, architectural, and artifactual data are assembled to provide insight into the nature of a migrating Thule group. The picture is one of a tightly organized community of five families centred on a communal structure (karigi), which may have faced a difficult winter while at Pembroke. [159] First Chair Frink, Liam (University of Nevada Las Vegas) [241] The Political Economy of Native Alaskan Children and Religious Colonialism Although Native children were one of the primary components of colonial change, they have been fairly neglected by researchers. Alaskan children were a primary source of labor for the early to mid 20th century Jesuits. Children processed enormous amounts of foods such as fish for subsistence and commercial use. Child labor was the backbone of the religious arm of the colonial project and yet these practices have not been examined--relegating this complex history to Fogelsons` silenced non-event. I explore the experience of these children with archival records and interviews with Yup`ik adults who lived and worked at the missions. Fritz, Crystal (Independent Scholar) [13] The economic role of elites in pre-Islamic southeastern Arabia There is solid evidence for the existence of elites in southeastern Arabia during the first millennium BCE, including specialized buildings, luxury goods and ritual ceramics. Their economic role, however, is unclear. Status divisions are conspicuously absent in burials and there is evidence that they did not control the production and exchange of major commodities. In this paper, I will explore the archaeological evidence for the economic role of elites in Iron Age II southeastern Arabia.

Fruhlinger, Jake (Idaho Army National Guard) and Jessica Dougherty (Idaho Army National Guard) [150] Techniques for Site Management within National Guard Training Areas Archaeological resources documentation in the Orchard Training Area (OTA) has yielded large quantities of valuable data. The construction of a database, allows the IDARNG to easily utilize and store information. The database allows for greater collaboration with outside agencies. This database is vital to the archaeological community of the Snake River Plain as it informs on an area that has seen little archaeological research. Maintaining an organized database aids the military because it allows for more informed decisions pertaining to site mitigation. This serves to preserve cultural resources for future generations and also allows for

responsible training within the OTA. [150] Second Organizer Fryer, Brian J [49] see Hewitt, Barbara R. Fuld, Kristen (Portland State University) [30] Bone and Antler Tools on the Lower Columbia: A comparison of two contact period sites. Studies of technological organization and changes in technology over time revolve around stone tools. Bone and antler tools are often overlooked or simply described. This is likely due to preservation problems or small assemblage size. Northwest Coast archaeological assemblages are dominated by bone and antler tools providing the opportunity for research. The Cathlapotle (45CL1) and Meier (35CO5) sites, located along the Columbia River, are large contact period village sites that were occupied simultaneously. This research examines and compares the role of bone and antler technology at the two sites both pre and post contact. Fuller, Dorian (University College London), Alison Weisskopf (University College London), Eleanor Kingwell-Banham (University College London) and Ling Qin (Peking University/ University College London) [111] Reconstructing arable rice systems in prehistory Cultivation of rice may include a wide range of practices and ecologies, from upland/rainfed to intensively irrigated or deeply flooded. The distinctions between these systems have major implications for human landuse practices in the past, arable productivity, as for the production of greenhouse gasses such as methane. In order to reconstruct how rice was cultivated, and indeed to reconstruct when rice cultivation first emerged from wild gathering, the evidence of rice itself is less informative than the associated weed flora. We present progress of weed flora indicators of cultivation practice recovered from both phytolith and macro-remains assemblages. [45] Discussant Funes, Jorge [142] see Pintar, Elizabeth L.

Human crania affiliated with the highland Chanka (AD 1000-1400) and coastal Pachacamac (AD ca. 800-1450) societies were examined to see if cranial modification is associated with signs of diminished health, including Porotic Hyperostosis, Cribra Orbitalia, and dental pathologies. 30 Crania recovered as part of the Proyecto Bioarqueologico Andahuaylas were compared with 30 cranial from the Morton-Pachacamac collection housed at the University of Pennsylvania. Initial results suggest significant health differences between modified and unmodified individuals in both regions.

[179] Small Sites, Big Questions: Seasonality, Foraging, and Fremont Horticulture in the Eastern Great Basin The discovery of substantial buried prehistoric components at two Holly UNEV Pipeline Project sites in Utah`s west desert is a relatively rare occurrence. Wickiup features and the artifact, floral, and faunal assemblages suggest that these sites were used as seasonal short-term habitations whose primary function was for resource procurement. Using these data, we investigate small scale, localized Fremont behavior outside of the traditional village environment. We address subsistence and technology practices that, when combined with existing research at other small Fremont sites, add to our picture of Great Basin settlement pattern, horticulture, and broad-scale landscape use.

There are at least three components in a stratified context, with the oldest dated to the late Pleistocene, and the youngest dated to the late Holocene. Stratigraphy consists of basal gravels, overlain by 3m of aeolian sand, which is, in turn, capped by 1m of loess. Limited test excavations have recovered hundreds of flakes, stone tools, and large mammal remains, with the majority of the remains coming from the late Pleistocene component in the upper portions of the sand.

The Late Intermediate Period discoveries include principal burials, human sacrifices, and re-interred parts. The sacrifices, including sub-adults, are retainer sacrifices intended to accompany principal personages through the afterlife. The inclusion of sub-adult sacrifices with a sub-adult principal burial exemplifies the like with like pattern seen at numerous Andean sites. These mortuary

patterns, seen at both ceremonial centers and non-huaca sites, appear to represent a fundamental Andean complex of ritual behavior, which persists through time.

Gallaga, Emiliano (Director Del Centro INAH, ChiapasMuseo Regional De Chiapas) [41] The way to make a mirror, an experimental archaeology project Among all items created by prehispanic crafters, mirrors or objects with reflecting surfaces- commonly made of obsidian, hematite, or pyrite- have frequently caught the eye of researchers (Blainey 2007; Gallaga 2001; Pereira 2008; Salinas 1995). Yet, little research has addressed the difficulty of the manufacture of these objects, their importance in the archaeological record, and their role(s) as markers of social status and/or prestige and/or ceremonial good explicitly. An experimental project of pyrite mirror production was conducted to arrive at some answers on these still elusive topics. This paper will present its preliminary results.

This paper uses archaeological evidence from Jamaica, Nevis and the Chesapeake to assess local patterns of change and variation in the roles that markets played in enslaved peoples` lives. Drawing on models of market dynamics, we suggest how enslaved market participants enjoyed important adaptive advantages over non-participants. We examine the abundance of locally manufactured ceramics, Chinese and European ceramics and other imported goods to measure change in market participation and uptake of costly consumer goods in each region.

Only the elite were members of the most restricted secret societies that had esoteric knowledge and access to certain supernatural powers. The riverine groups of central California and the more maritime oriented societies of southern California serve as examples of pathways to power and its materiality.

This presentation explores the social

implications of dietary patterns of individuals buried in the Yukisma Mound (CA-SCl-38), an ancestral Muwekma Ohlone mortuary mound in Santa Clara County, California. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of bone collagen and bioapatite is used to assess dietary patterns of 126 individuals, interred between 1700 BP and 180 BP. Correlation with age, sex, associated mortuary regalia, and temporal placement suggests a strong relationship between ascribed social status and the foods people consumed during their lifetimes. Gardner, Karen [194] see Bartelink, Eric J. Garfinkel, Alan P. [231] see Binning, Jeanne Day Garraty, Christopher (Statistical Research, Inc.) [151] The Post-Conquest Origins of Pottery among the Tongva-Gabrielino: Indigenous Brown Wares from the Ballona This paper focuses on the circumstances under which the Tongva-Gabrielino adopted practical pottery technology during the Mission period. Roughly 110 undecorated indigenous-style ceramic sherds were recovered from a Protohistoric-Mission period living surface in the Ballona, most of which are small fragments from undecorated brown or gray vessels likely used for cooking. Some inhabitants of the Ballona appear to have been incorporated into nearby missions and the Pueblo of Los Angeles. Thus, it is crucial to consider the extent to which this investment in pottery technology was attributable to Hispanic influences versus indigenous responses to changing social and economic conditions.

Whilst economic utility studies have been completed on numerous ungulates from elsewhere, only two Australian studies have attempted to evaluate the economic utility and/or fatty acids analysis of select kangaroo and wallaby species. The data for a third important target prey ­ the emu - is the subject of this study.

phenomenon is often attributed to abandonment in the face of prolonged droughts, but the extent to which the lack of sites owes to sampling biases versus human behaviors remains unclear. Preliminary OHD rim measurements and calibration curves suggest that western Argentine obsidians hydrate at a knowable rate, offering a new means of dating surface finds and distinguishing between alternative explanations for the apparent gap, a crucial initiative for understanding human adaptive responses to mid-Holocene climate changes. Gasco, Janine (CSU-Dominguez Hills) [200] Four Decades of Tom Charlton's Research on Post-Conquest Archaeology in Mesoamerica As early as the mid 1960s Tom Charlton had begun to conduct research on the Post-Conquest history of the Valley of Mexico, a research interest that eventually expanded to include other regions of Mesoamerica. Tom`s pioneering work inspired subsequent generations of Mesoamerican archaeologists to look beyond the artificial line that separated Pre-Conquest and PostConquest historical trends and instead to consider longer-term processes of change and continuity. In this paper I review some of Tom`s most significant contributions to the archaeology of Post-Conquest Mesoamerica, and I discuss how his work has influenced archaeological research for over forty years.

Since the pictographs were re-recorded in 2001, research into the original condition and degradation was compiled in order to create a preservation plan. This presentation will show the progression of the archival reconstruction of the pictographs, will show the linguistic relationships to the family use routes, and will describe the village region environment of the images. The images that will be examined are listed as the Valley Images. Gaspar, Maria (Museu Nacional) and Daniela Klokler (Museu Nacional/UFRJ) [253] Amourins: same site, different perspectives. Sambaqui archaeology 30 years later Revisit to Amourins site with reanalysis of materials and profile studies provided elements for a reinterpretation of the site's function and the area's occupation. At the beginning of its occupation the site was located in wetlands and accumulation of shell valves formed a dry surface/platform. We believe that oysters and thick lucine were probably chosen and used as raw material for platform construction for symbolic reasons and were not largely consumed. The construction of this shell site, as other larger sites in southern Brazil are directly associated with funerary ritual, with strong evidence of performance of feasting.

Gataveckas, Katrina (The University of Toronto) [227] Domestic Spatial Organization: An Articulation of Elite Political Strategies and Religious Ideologies at the Moche Site of Huaca Colorada Preliminary archaeological investigations of the differential construction, renovation, and function of residential, ceremonial and production sectors at the Late Moche site of Huaca Colorada in the Jequetepeque Valley allow investigation into the impact of larger administrative structures at the domestic level, and local reactions to these structures. I argue that Moche elite political strategies and religious ideologies shaped the organization, representation, and use of quotidian space at Huaca Colorada. Study of the spatial aspects of lowstatus production and dwelling structures in the lower zone of the settlement will illuminate the complex association between domestic and administrative spheres at the site.

The goal of this research is to verify and understand the possible variation in the use of endscrapers in relation to the main function of the sites where they were recovered. Thus, endscrapers from a village site, a fishing station, a hunting camp and an intertribal gathering site were selected and submitted to use wear analysis. The results are compared and interpreted using a regional approach instead of a site-oriented perspective only. Gatewood, Jeff [22] see Marshall, David A. Gear, W.

The continuous use of the road reflects the path of least resistance rule in a demanding landscape. Limitations such as rocky terrain, access to water and a high desert climate dictate its path. 21st century limitations such as checkerboard land ownership, restrictive budgets and generational passages threaten to forget it. A collaborative project, between the USFS, BLM and NRCS involves survey, historical maps and oral history to record segments of the road.

Warfare might also be inferred from distinctive wooden artifacts commonly referred to as fending sticks because of a suspected defensive use in batting away atlatl darts. Found throughout the greater southwest, detailed study was recently undertaken to determine their function and temporal distribution as part of a larger inquiry into the cause(s) of Basketmaker conflict.

While technical fine-tuning continues, studies about diet, migration, disease, and domestication have proved informative. Yet, new ways of doing do not necessitate new ways of thinking. Further deliberation about bioethical parameters is required. Scholars have recently broached scientific racism and repatriation. Here I consider the bioethics of using aDNA to sex bodies,

specifically those of children. I argue that given theoretically deficient understandings many researchers` subsequent inferences characterize gender as essence rather than process or performance. [217] Discussant Gelvin-Reymiller, Carol (University of Alaska, Fairbanks) and Joshua Reuther (University of Arizona, Tucson) [179] Quartz Lake, Interior Alaska: Human Presence throughout the Holocene Four lakeshore sites at Quartz Lake, mid-Tanana River region, were examined to explore relationships of lacustrine ecology to regional human land-use. Taphonomic variables encourage faunal preservation at two dry sites, and alkaline lake waters encourage preservation at two submerged sites; recent low water levels augment site discovery. Erosional/depositional episodes are evident in sediments, with accompanying shifts in occupations and site selections between 13,000 years cal BP and AD 1850. Analysis indicates Quartz Lake is one of a series of lakes and lowland sites connected to other regions via trade/transport networks, with optimal local resources and topography repeatedly attractive to humans.

Geurds, Alexander (Leiden University) [183] Materials and materiality of megalithics in Nicaragua Megalithic stones are a global prehistoric phenomenon. From unworked to entirely shaped, they are an artifact category retaining a strong natural character. Central Nicaraguan megalithics are examined here with this broad perspective in mind. In moving away from traditional categorizations of typology and class, contextual data are used to gain insights into the assemblages in which these stones occurred. It is argued that megalithics in Nicaragua were not isolated but usually grouped, thereby creating an internal structure for sites of ceremony. The choices involved in creating these assemblages in turn suggest communally shared efforts, technology and memories.

Gender affects the use and experience of cultural spaces. Decisions that undoubtedly involve gendered relationships contribute to ideas about how to build houses and for how long houses should be occupied. The Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43 has frequently been viewed as having a significant impact on such Iron Age practices. Examining transformations in everyday household space and gendered identity sheds light on the varying experiences that contributed to Romanization. Ghukasyan, Robert [114] see Egeland, Charles P.

Gibb, Heather (University of Missouri-Columbia) [180] Anatomical Refitting Using Visual Comparison on Deer (Odocoileus spp.) Linear measurements have been used to identify bilaterally paired skeletal elements from zooarchaeological assemblages. Visual comparison has been used to detect incorrect pairs identified with metric comparison under the assumption that visual comparison of non-metric traits correctly identify bilateral pairs. This assumption was tested using a collection of deer (Odocoileus spp.) skeletons composed of known bilateral pairs. In blind tests, bilateral pairs suggested by linear measurements, both incorrect and correct, were documented. Researchers then identified bilateral pairs using visual comparison. Visual comparison does not correct most errors resulting from metric comparison, indicating the key assumption is unwarranted. Gibb, James (Independent Scholar) [122] Up from Flatland: Discovering Three-Dimensional Characters through Alternative Narrative Forms Language is linear, but not so the ideas it expresses.

inconsistencies with new ones. Theatrical productions can lay bare to public view the process and products of historical interpretation. When the persons variously portrayed are themselves historical, the audience experiences the complexities of their characters and views, and the unexpected outcomes of their interactions. A brief fictitious dialogue between two prominent Americans illustrates the non-linearity of pastpresent-future. Gibbs, Tim (Museum of Northern Arizona), Kristin M.

The emergence of mortars and pestles on the adjacent mainland beginning around 4000 BC may indicate an expansion of the diet to include new plant foods. A bedrock mortar site (SCRI-814) located in the interior of Santa Cruz Island radiocarbon dated to between 4190 BC and 2890 BC was recently identified. Floral and faunal analyses at this site provide a basis for understanding the role of terrestrial resources in interior island settings on the Channel Islands.

Although archaeologists have studied the bowls and burials for almost 100 years, we are far from any consistent understanding of Mimbres burial patterns ­ who was buried in which ways, where, and with what? Our paper focuses on the issues surrounding the Mimbres mortuary database assembly.

We undertook a project to synthesize these faunal records to reconstruct paleoenvironments and consider the causes of Late Quaternary extinctions. We have obtained AMS ages on 15 individuals from five genera (Bison, Mammut, Mammuthus, Equus, Paramylodon) dating between ~15,000-11,000 cal yrs BP. Results suggest a mixed grazer/browser community persisted from the Clovis Horizon until the Younger Dryas boundary. Implications for the extinction debate and Late Pleistocene forager adaptations are considered.

Gingerich, Joseph (University of Wyoming) and Nathaniel Kitchel (University of Wyoming) [155] Early Paleoindian Subsistence Strategies in Eastern North America: A continuation of the Clovis tradition? Or evidence of regional adaptations? On a continental scale, Clovis subsistence strategies have often been characterized by the hunting of large game. Unlike the early archaeological record of the western United States, subsistence residues and the occurrence of kill sites are rare in the east. Discoveries of abundant plant remains in Clovis-age sites like ShawneeMinisink, however, suggest diversity in early Paleoindian lifeways. This paper will review the subsistence data from fluted point sites in eastern North America and discuss similarities in subsistence patterns that begin in the Clovis era and continue throughout the duration of the eastern fluted point tradition.

Sourcing results have been used to identify trade routes, territorial boundaries, migration patterns, and develop models for procurement and exchange. Large geochemical databases exist and portable instruments offering rapid, non-destructive capabilities are readily available. As a consequence, obsidian sourcing has become a highly routine and successful practice. In spite of all we have learned when employing elemental analysis, there are still some potential pitfalls which occur due to inadequate source characterization and failure to understand the requirements and limitations of individual analytical methods.

It has been suggested from a recent textile analysis that the burials from both cemeteries, 21-S-46 and 21-R-2, date to the Early Christian Period (A.D. 600-850). However, marked differences in population mortality and overall rates of stress as exhibited osteologically are seemingly indicative of diachronic populations. Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen stable isotope analysis of preserved hair allows for a new approach to evaluating differences between the two cemetery populations.

These sites vary in size, most being very small but two having substantial midden deposits. Kennett proposed that the largest sites were villages and the small sites were logistical

encampments. Other models of settlement systems of this period posit more complicated types of settlement systems and take into consideration new information about site characteristics. Attempts to understand settlement systems on Santa Cruz Island have implications for those on the other Channel Islands dating to the same time period. Glidden, Catherine (Surface Transportation Board) and Ben Rodd (Rosebud Sioux Tribe) [154] Rethinking the National Register Criteria for Tribal Sites The criteria for determining significance are defined by the National Register established in 1966. Since 1992, however, sites of religious or cultural importance to tribes have been added to the National Register as a property type. However, in evaluating such sites, Federal agencies must use the same criteria developed to assess the significance of historic buildings etc. - an imperfect fit at best. We discuss the need to create an alternative process that equally considers the distinctive perspective of tribes within the context of the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad Project.

After a hiatus of around 200 years, a group of people resettled the island during the Terminal Classic period. Who were these people, where did they come from, how did they engage in burgeoning circumpeninsular trade networks, and how do we address these questions archaeologically?

However, the period of severe drought and presumably related violence prompted various coping strategies including increased aggregation and changes in settlement location, layout, and village-level organization. Using recent settlement and tree-ring data, this paper compares how these changes were expressed in different parts of the region. [46] see Lipe, William D. Godos, Fernando [221] see Ardren, Traci Goebel, Ted (Texas A&M University) and Joshua Keene (Texas A&M University) [94] A Critical Review of the "Long Chronology" for Stemmed Points in the Intermountain West of North America Are the intermountain west`s stemmed points as old as or older than Clovis (13 ka), and do they represent a distinct, early dispersal of humans? Radiocarbon dates from sites like Hatwai, Coopers Ferry, and Smith Creek Cave suggest so, leading to the proposition of a long chronology for stemmed points. Here we review the geochronological evidence from these and other stemmed-point sites with dates >12 ka, and counter that most of the evidence for such early stemmed points is equivocal, many of the sites need to be redated, and for now a short chronology better explains the evidence at hand.

Gold, Alan (AECOM) [158] Reproductive Symbolism in Great Basin Rock Art Promotion of the generative powers of animals and humans is a concern of major religions and small-scale societies the world over. Conventionalized symbols provide a window into ceremonial life. Coso rock drawings include imagery linking hunting with game animal fertility and human sexuality. This perspective is explored through a review of the form and content of Coso animal depictions and an examination of related material in Great Basin ethnology, oral tradition, and hunting terminology. One prominent theme in Coso rock art appears to be the fostering of animal and human fertility or increase and a means of affirming life.

I will attempt to review cremation practices in the Eastern U.S., focusing on when and where cremation occurs, patterns within the practice, and possible explanations for what cremation means in what context. In a number of cases, for example, cremation co-occurs with primary inhumation. Analysis will focus on context

In an attempt to address this issue, a metric approximating repair capacity was formulated and applied to quartz projectile point assemblages from both coastal and inland archaeological sites on Long Island, New York. A comparison of these data suggests that tool morphometrics upon deposition were highly patterned, with curation pressures intensifying at sites farther from quartz sources.

Reconstructions of sociopolitical characteristics, such as population estimates and complexity, are based on maize subsistence. Given the recent finds of manioc fields at Ceren, El Salvador, the implications of manioc subsistence must be considered for lowland (or tropical`) Mesoamerica.

Furthermore, prior archaeological studies have made no attempt to connect associated timber exploitation by agents of Manifest Destiny with the development of indigenous discontent. This study aims to address both deficiencies by linking charcoal production, timber resources, and indigenous rebellion against the backdrop of nineteenth-century Taos, New Mexico. More specifically, it will ask whether the production of charcoal by Taos distiller Simeon Turley led in some way to his operation`s demise at the hands of a local mob. Gonzalez, Jason J.

Isotopic data on body tissue and hair suggests that two of these individuals may have come from long distance, posing interesting questions about how the mine was utilized in antiquity.

Using Andean case studies, I present an approach that accommodates short-term events, both social and agricultural, and their cumulative impacts. I suggest that an emphasis on agrarian architecture, and landscape modification as a process, enables stronger models of socio-natural resilience in ancient farming landscapes.

Nevertheless, several interpretations of its function have been proposed, including dwelling, hunting blind, and wind break. While reinvestigating the site in 2010 we opened a block excavation around the feature to better understand its nature.

Major patterns include slants and rounding. Minor patterns were scoops and grooves. Statistically significant differences were identified. Analysis of the Southern population suggests these individuals had an elite class. The percentage of slants, rounding and scoops all increased through time from the older, Northern population to the younger southern population.

During this time, which did not end entirely until 1978, Native American religions, clothing, and languages were outlawed. In parts of the desert west, Native Americans continued traditional lifeways in remote areas far from Anglo settlements. This paper, based on results of a Department of Defense Legacy project conducted in Wyoming and Nevada, examines the material culture and geographic locations of such Native American refuge sites between roughly 1850 and 1942.

Artifact and cache analysis has undergone major changes in the last half a century. With the invention of new technologies and recent discoveries new patterns have emerged in the archaeological record. Petalas blades have long been thought to be used for the processing of migratory fish. Through research, analysis, experimentation, and the production of a number of GIS maps this hypothesis has fallen into question. Some of these argillite caches were undoubtedly used for the processing of fish; however others were definitely not used to this end and were perhaps instead instruments of trade.

This paper uses music archaeology and ethnographic analogy to examine central Andean music, from the Early Horizon to the Middle Horizon, with particular focus on the use of musical instruments by highland peoples. This work shows that music was part of an Andean tradition in which several prehispanic societies used musical instruments in rituals and ceremonies related to warfare, agricultural fertility, dedications, and burials.

While archaeological evidence points to growing interregional trade networks during the Bronze Age (3100-1200 BC) in the Near East, little is actually known about the movements of people that made these commerce-driven relations possible. Strontium (87Sr/86Sr) isotopes from human and faunal tooth enamel are utilized in reconstructing the childhood geographic residence of individuals interred across the Oman Peninsula in monumental tombs, visible markers of commemoration and territoriality that dominate the landscape. Major mortuary transformations from the Umm an-Nar (2500-2000 BC) to Wadi Suq (2000-1200 BC), accompanied by economic and sociocultural changes, are evaluated in light of temporal changes in mobility.

I present a model that posits ownership as an expansive and profound realignment of Coast Salish sociopolitics within a broader trajectory of increasing social complexity.

Griffin, Mark (San Francisco State University), David Grant (San Jose State University) and Randy Wiberg (Holman and Associates) [194] Oral Health Status in an Ancient Central California Population The Vineyards site (4-CCO-548) is a central California site dating to the Middle Archaic (4350 and 550 BC). The large sample size (N=479) makes the Vineyards site ideal for the examination of the relationship between attrition, caries, and periodontal disease. Results of this analysis show: (1) extensive dental attrition (6.11 on the Smith scale), (2) extraordinarily low frequency of carious lesions (2.5%), and (3) high frequency of apical abcesses (10.7%). Results of our analysis show that there is an inverse relationship between attrition and caries and a positive correlation of heavy attrition and apical abcesses.

This paper explores petroglyph abstractions from many regions of Mesoamerica which symbolically reference vast tracts of terrestrial space and their hydraulic features. Examples of speleothem sculptures in Belizean caves, whose large scale defies expectations of rock art`s size in relationship to the

Griffitts, Janet (SRI) [177] Birds of a feather: wild food use in turn-of-thecentury Tucson This study examines the varying ways of interpreting wild food use using different kinds of data and illustrates the importance of multiple lines of evidence. The study uses material recovered in SRI's excavations of the Joint Courts Complex project in Tucson, from two adjacent residences occupied by two generations of one family. Amounts and proportions of wild game differed between the two households, especially birds, but the household with more bird bone contained almost no ammunition. Finally, archival evidence provides hints to behaviors that could have caused this pattern. This study also examines social significance of different wild taxa.

Measurements of black abalone and California mussel indicate that the prehistoric inhabitants were over harvesting shellfish beds through time. Analytical results provide the following: evidence for impacts of human predation on shellfish populations over prolonged periods of harvesting; inferences on changes in subsistence patterns based on overexploitation of certain species; and reconstruction of foraging practices over a long archaeological sequence that can be compared to other island and coastal sites in southern California. Grillo, Katherine (Washington University in St. Louis) [208] Pastoralist Ethnoarchaeology on Household Container Assemblages in Samburu, Kenya Ethnoarchaeological research among a mobile herding community in Samburu, north-central Kenya, has yielded results on the multiple factors that influence household container assemblages. Data from household inventory surveys speak to how mobility, wealth, income, household demographics, and pastoralist subsistence influence the numbers and types of cooking, serving, and storage vessels found in Samburu homes. Particular attention will be paid to ceramics and their distribution across the broader pastoralist landscape. Discussion will also consider archaeological implications for future studies of pastoralist vs. hunter/gatherer and agriculturalist material cultures.

This paper presents an example of how the Maya Hieroglyphic Database is used to identify correlations between hieroglyphic texts and specific positions in the tropical year. "Uhuk Chapat Tz'ikin K'inich Ajaw" is a deity name mentioned throughout the corpus of Maya inscriptions. The database identifies most known examples of this name, together with the Long Count dates of the monuments on which they appear. An analysis of this data suggests a strong correlation between this deity and the solar nadir at Maya latitudes. This correspondence is informative when considering additional iconographic, ethnographic, and astronomical information. Grossardt, Ted [64] see Mink, Philip B. Grove, Matt (University of Liverpool) [43] Viable versatilists? A single locus model of variability sele ction The variability selection hypothesis suggests that increases in environmental fluctuation have led to the evolution of complex, flexible behaviors a ble to respond to novel and unpredictable adaptive settings. This hypothesis is tested via the framework of a single locus genetic model in which an invading versatilist` allele com petes with two opposed specialists in a selection regime driven by a temporally fluctuating environment. Results demonstrate that versatilist alleles achieve fixation given a minor fitness increase over the basic generalist template. These results are discussed in relation to the appearance and spread of Oldowan technologies. Grover, Margan (Bold Peak Archaeological Services) [195] Historical Archaeology of Early Russian America on Adak Island, Central Aleutian Islands For decades, small-scale Russian fur traders moved across Russia, eventually arriving in Kamchatka and the Aleutian Islands. The 1741 Bering and Chirikov expedition confirmed the existence of the Aleutian Islands and mainland Alaska, and revealed a region rich in resources. The evidence of these early hunters on the landscape is minimal, yet their impact was immeasurable. This paper will explore several early Russian American period sites on Adak Island and the relatively untapped data potential for historical archaeology in the Central Aleutian region.

Importantly, at least two large elite residential groups continued to renovate and rededicate structures and to reorient themselves to external political powers after the central precinct was abandoned. We also review the Postclassic occupation and use of the extensive system of ditched agricultural fields, though we are uncertain

Guengerich, Anna (University of Chicago) [227] Public, private, and the political house: reconfiguring the role of residential structures in late prehispanic Chachapoyas Round stone structures dominate the built environment of settlements in late prehispanic Chachapoyas. Although usually glossed simply as houses, preliminary architectural analysis suggests that these structures transcended strictly domestic functions to play an encompassing role in Chacha societies, serving as the primary theaters of social, political, and ritual life. These buildings are distinguished by a high degree of artistic embellishment and technical expertise, traits usually associated with the monumental constructions of hierarchical polities. The Chacha database further problematizes our conceptions and theoretical models of the household and how we understand its relationship to public spheres of political activity. Guernsey, Julia (University Of Texas At Austin) [186] From household to plaza: figurines, sculpture, and the construction of elite identity in the Preclassic Aspects of the La Blanca ceramic figurine tradition, a hallmark of Middle Preclassic household ritual, anticipate Late Preclassic sculpture programs, in particular the famous yet enigmatic potbellies or barrigónes. I link these intriguing transitions between figurines and sculpture, and domestic and public space, to the construction of elite identity during the Late Preclassic period and discuss how it appears to have successfully appropriated earlier domestic ritual forms. The paper also touches on the implications of this evidence as it regards the transition from chiefdoms to states during the Middle to Late Preclassic period in this region.

By conducting one-way independent (student`s) t-tests, a statistically significant difference was found between males and females for the MD and BL measurements of the upper and lower canines of each the left and right sides. A discriminant analysis was conducted using SPSS. The resulting discriminant function and cut-off score was used to predict group membership (male or female) for previously indeterminant individuals from the Vineyards site. The results of this analysis will provide a useful tool for assessing sex in fragmentary remains.

Gullapalli, Praveena (Rhode Island College) [189] Crafting Continuity: Delineating (Social) Actions in Metal Artifacts Sites from South India have yielded an extraordinary corpus of early metal artifacts that have been subjected to analyses that highlight their functional efficacy and the technical expertise of their makers. I use extant metallurgical data to continue the discussion of how these artifacts were made, moving beyond a narrow focus on utilitarian paradigms to investigate evidence for other types of information that might be encoded within them. I argue that certain patterns in the production practices of the early South Indian metalworkers ­ such as lamination ­ could also be understood to be as much social practices as technical ones.

Gravestones at different sites exhibit similar decorative motifs; however there is no other physical evidence to support their inter-island exchange. Using portable X-Ray Fluorescence (pXRF) technology, we reconstruct gravestone trade by analyzing and comparing the elemental signature of over 200 metamorphic gravestones and bedrock samples from seven islands. Preliminary data analysis has identified multiple patterns of inter-community exchange and local production.

Yet, data from this island are important because the three main Northern Channel Islands vary in size, environment, and biodiversity. These differences can have a profound effect on foraging and mobility. Recent excavations have provided data that help clarify the nature of Early Holocene mobility and settlement systems on Santa Cruz Island.

The focus is on three areas of investigation specifically, sites within the impact areas, sites within the maneuver training areas, and those sites outside of the OTA boundaries. The project will take into account controls and efforts to abate looting, military training activities, and environmental changes to site areas over time.

We have recently explored the efficacy of GIS on an intrasite basis. Here, we focus on CA-SNI-25, a village site with excellent stratigraphy, chronology, and preservation and examine variations in lithic technology in association with archaeological features within separate loci. Bivariate and multivariate spatial data are statistically and visually analyzed and interpreted. This methodology offers a window into spatial and temporal variability in technology, subsistence, and the organization of traditional village life before European influence.

While reflecting some general similarities with other fourteenth century, carbonpainted, Rio Grande White Ware assemblages, it is not easily sorted into the standard types, most of which were defined from sites further north.

We examine the archaeological evidence at each of these to characterize the Wari`s production, consumption, and distribution of this fermented beverage. By comparing this practice to the traditions of alcohol consumption of the Tiwanaku and the Inka, we discern a pre-Hispanic paradigm of consumption. We explore how the Wari diverged from this model by consuming molle beer instead of maize beer and the possible reasons for this unique cultural preference. Hadden, Carla and Kelly Orr (American Association for the Advancement of Science) [10] Lumping and Splitting: Measuring the Effects of Data Aggregation on Site Interpretation Data aggregation is inherent to archaeology, but the way we decide to lump or divide our data may result in subtle differences in interpretation. To better understand these affects, we recorded primary zooarchaeological data (e.g., taxonomic identification, count, weight) from several discrete, rapidly deposited features from Bayou St. John (1BA21), a Late Woodland site in coastal Alabama. The feature data were aggregated or partitioned according to a variety of random and nonrandom schemes, and secondary data (e.g., biomass, diversity, equitability) were derived from each aggregated dataset. The results illustrate the importance of selecting appropriate data aggregation schemes.

Such practices may have taken priority over extractive core-periphery relations or other visible, active, enforced power relations with larger ceremonial centers. Paleoethnobotanical and ceramic evidence argue for a local tradition of periodic feasting and daily provisioning based on available resources of the bajos, forests, and farmland. Our test cases indicate locally mediated land use was germane to developing and maintaining social ties, and in rural contexts may have taken priority over interaction with regional-scale power brokers. Hager, Lori (Catalhoyuk Research Project) [16] The Young and the Old: Sex-related Age Differences and Age-related Sex Differences Gender identity of individuals from archaeological sites begins with accurate determinations of age and sex.

Since many factors, including age, sex and gender, contribute to bone development and bone degradation, the age of an individual influences the morphologies used to determine sex and the sex of an individual influences the morphologies used to determine age. The importance of sex to age determinations, such as in young people where males and females mature at different times, and of age to sex determinations, such as in older females where hormonal shifts have consequences in skeletal biology, are issues bioarchaeologists need to revisit.

One aspect of urbanization in the Aegean at the end of the Early Iron Age (ca. 800-600 B.C.) is the nucleation of population--settlement aggregation and the restructuring of social, political and economic landscapes, giving rise to Classical Greek cities and city-states. This paper presents a case study of an excavation of one such early emergent center, the site of Azoria on Crete (700-500 B.C.), examining patterns of agropastoral production and consumption in specific contexts (domestic and communal) of emerging public and civic institutions and buildings that mediated social and political interaction and formed mechanisms of community organization and integration.

Previously thought to be a subsidiary site of the larger centre of Lamanai (roughly 10 km distant) this new data shows that Ka`Kabish possessed its own elite residents, economic base, and program of ritual architecture indicative of a thriving independent city.

The associated assemblage fits the classic La Jolla (i.e., Millingstone Horizon) profile, characterized by large numbers of groundstone tools, cobble tools, and crude flaked stone tools. Placed in a regional context, this site is the anchor for one of the longest-standing socioeconomic patterns known for the New World and forces reconsideration of the character of cultural evolution.

Geoarchaeological analyses, including remote sensing, vibrocoring, sediment analysis, unit excavation, and radiocarbon dating, are being done at two submerged sinkhole localities in the Aucilla River of northwestern Florida. Both contain diagnostic Paleoindian artifacts and potentially intact strata. One, Sloth Hole, has been extensively excavated, while the other, Wayne`s Sink, is well-known to local collectors.

Hallmann, Nadine [205] see Burchell, Meghan Halperin, Christina (Princeton University) [93] Maya Political Economies: Creative Improvisations and Structural Reproductions This paper examines Maya economic practices in relation to political transformations between Classic and Postclassic periods. Emphasis is placed on incorporating multiple scales of analysis to underscore the notion that while both agency and structure are two sides of the same coin, they are not necessarily visible under the same spatial-temporal lenses. I turn, in particular, to reproductions and changes in ceramic media to explore ways in which material remains reflect broad political and economic reorganization. When tied to particular places and temporal moments, however, the continuities and shifts in pottery are more firmly tied to the ways in which past peoples creatively improvised with, reinvented, and embraced the structural constraints and practices to which they belonged. Hambrecht, George (CUNY Graduate Center) and Frank Feeley (CUNY Graduate Center) [202] Historical Archaeology in Barbuda Barbuda in the post-Columbian period did not fit into the classic Caribbean narrative centered around sugar.

Results indicate that the perimortem and postmortem treatment of the sacrificial victims included facial and genital mutilation, decapitation, defleshing and dismemberment, and likely involved metal tools.

Over perhaps 100 years, a system of ditches, surrounding walls, indirect entrances, and ramparts was constructed, extended, and repaired to accommodate the expanding settlement. We employ a three-dimensional model of these features to discuss their form, function, and chronology.

However, prairie grasses possess a formidable root mat and are difficult to till even with metal tools, therefore the effectiveness of chert hoes is uncertain.

In contrast, techniques used during the succeeding Middle Ceramic Period (2200-1250 cal years BP) were distinguished by a series of innovations, including the removal of pointed flakes and blades from carefully prepared cores.

Specifically, the study region is CharazaniCamata, located in the confines of the Inka Empire. This region, inhabited by the Kallawaya, was central in facilitating the interaction of peoples and resources between the highlands and tropical lowlands. In this poster, the results of a pedestrian survey along a segment of the pre-Columbian road will be presented, in order to assess its function, changes over time, and kinds of shifts promoted by the empire.

Recent work in the region between the Chalchihuites and Casas Grandes cultures confirms the general absence of prehistoric aggregated settlements and intensive agricultural adaptations. Despite being situated between Mesoamerican and Southwestern intensive agriculturalists, and the presence of well watered river valleys, 400-800 mm of rainfall, and long frost-free seasons, the region only supported mobile, mixed hunting and gathering and farming adaptations. The ecology of this surprising pattern may have implications for understanding agricultural adaptations more widely. Hard, Robert [244] see MacWilliams, Arthur C. Hardesty, Donald and Eugene Hattori [18] The Evolution of Historical Archaeology in the American West This paper explores the past, present, and future of the archaeology of the Modern World in the American West. It considers historical issues in method and theory, environmental change and landscapes of the modern world, the archaeology of industry and industrial life support systems, class and ethnicity, sex/gender systems, the archaeology of emigration and colonization, the archaeology of contact, public archaeology, urban archaeology, world systems, and historic preservation.

[269] Transforming Natural Landscape into Sacred Place: The Huacas of Inca Cuzco Many of the hundreds of sacred shrines (huacas) around Cuzco were organized into a system of ceque lines, through which the Inca inscribed meaning onto the landscape and physical space surrounding the ancient capital. Much of our current knowledge of how these huacas were organized has stemmed from textual evidence, but less has been done through archaeological survey and especially excavation. This paper seeks to explore processes by which the Inca physically and culturally transformed these huacas into sacred, cultural place, particularly through alterations in the landscape. New evidence is discussed from excavations conducted on huacas around Cuzco. [269] First Chair Hare, Lizzy (University of Florida) [212] A Holistic Approach to Environmental Archaeology at the Classic Maya site of Motul de San Jose, Guatemala. In this paper, I bring together zooarchaeological and paleobotanical datasets from the Classic Maya site of Motul de San Jose, Guatemala. By analyzing multiple lines of environmental data, we are better able to determine which types of proxy data are better suited for use by archaeologists in this area. Additionally, the use of multiple types of data should provide a more complete understanding of the ecological and economic processes of the site than either zooarchaeological or paleobotanical analyses alone.

Pete Gregory (Northwestern State University of Louisiana) and Jeff Girard (Northwestern State University of Louisiana) [64] Demonstrating an integrated multi-sensor geophysical approach at Presidio Los Adaes, Louisiana A 5-year project has demonstrated an integrated, multisensor geophysical approach for investigating archaeological sites. A new software (ArchaeoFusion) was developed to reduce the technical expertise and labor requirements that previously restricted use of the approach. A core group of geophysical practitioners evaluated ArchaeoFusion`s capabilities relative to alternative software. Presidio Los Adaes, an 18th century Spanish fort and mission in west-central Louisiana served as the demonstration site. Large site areas were surveyed using gradiometry, magnetic susceptibility, conductivity, resistance, and GPR during the 2009 NPS class in remote sensing. Interpretations of selected anomalies were evaluated by small scaled excavations in May 2010. Hargrave, Michael [193] see Lundin, Richard J. [162] see Baxter, Carey L.

Cueva San Borjitas is located near Mulege in Baja California Sur. On its magnificent ceiling are over 80 polychrome painted anthropomorphs. The figures represent several different styles. Figure overlap can give clues to the style sequence. The figures are generally well preserved, but nevertheless pigments have faded, some colors more than others. I will use DStretch, an image enhancement program used by rock art researchers worldwide, to demonstrate the existence of figures and details of figures not documented by previous researchers. These details give new insights into stylistic conventions and concerns of the Great Mural painters. Harrington, Lucy [158] see Dodd, Lynn S. Harris, Kathryn (Washington State University) and Philip Fisher (Washington State University) [257] Efficiency of hafted bifaces as saws This study examines the efficiency of hafted bifaces as saws. While previous research indicates that hafted bifaces were used as multipurpose tools, little is known about the actual application of a hafted biface as a saw. Results of this experiment suggest: hafted bifaces do not quickly lose sawing efficiency over several uses and resharpenings, maximum raw material efficiency varies depending on the length of time the biface is used, and variability in hafting method and shape of the biface may influence sawing efficiency. While preliminary, this study is a useful springboard for understanding the relationship between tool design and function. Harris, Kathryn [257] see Fisher, Philip R. Harrison, Ainslie [193] see Beaubien, Harriet F. Harrison-Buck, Eleanor (University of New Hampshire) [191] The Fall of the Classic Maya Kings: Defaced Monuments as Acts of Violence David Stuart (1996) argued that monuments with images of Maya kings were not just elite portraits, but viewed as extensions of the royal self. As animate persons, these "kings of stone" were active agents and their defacement is interpreted as evidence of violent overthrow. I examine monument defacement associated with the destruction and abandonment of elite residences at the end of the Classic period, often interpreted as the result of longterm warfare among elites. I cross-examine this interpretation and suggest shifts in regional power brought changes in warfare practice and contributed to the downfall of Classic Maya aristocracy. Harrod, Ryan (UNLV) and Debra Martin (University of Nevada, Las Vegas) [237] Taphonomy After the Fact: Violence, Sex and Ritual in Room 33 at Chaco Chaco Canyon`s Room 33, discovered by George Pepper in 1896, is recognized for its rich taphonomic context that reveals great detail about ritualized behavior (e.g., perimortem violence, exotic and extensive grave goods and social status). One male burial shows evidence of extensive perimortem fractures on the cranium suggesting a violent death. Researchers such as Akins, Schelberg and Palkovich provided partial analyses of the skeletal material in the 1980s, however this reanalysis of the remains considers the burials in relation

to the grave goods, archaeological records, and historical documents to provide a better understanding of this elaborate and unique mortuary room. [237] First Chair Harrold, Francis (Univ of Nebraska at Kearney) [218] Attempting Synthesis in the Late Bordesian Era: The Example of the Chatelperronian In the synthetic study of an industrial tradition and/or geographic region, the author gathers data from many excavations and analyses to discern and explain patterning in the archaeological record. The worker must sort out different kinds of evidence, recovered at different times by different investigators and methods, differentially available for study, and in varying conditions of curation. Using as an example my 1978 study of the Chatelperronian, I discuss the difficulties, shortcomings, and possibilities of such an approach. Harrower, Michael (Johns Hopkins University) [13] Geo-Economics of Water across Ancient Southern Arabia Water and irrigation shaped ancient geographies and economies across Southern Arabia. Through Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based modeling of hydrology, this paper considers the spatial distribution tombs, settlements and societies with respect to water resources. In particular, differential patterning and configurations of ancient Southwest and Southeast Arabian societies are highlighted. Hart, Isaac (University of Utah) [91] A 4,000 year Pollen Record from Range Creek Canyon, Utah I will present a 4,000 year pollen record from a bog core taken from upper Range Creek canyon, Utah. The core is part of a larger project involving the analysis of several pollen samples and woodrat middens taken in the canyon in an effort to reconstruct biotic communities before during and after the fluorescence of Fremont occupation at roughly 1,000 A.D. Results from this kind of research are key to understanding the ecological factors constraining human activity in Range Creek and have implications for the forager-agriculturalist transition in general. Hart, John (New York State Museum) and William Engelbrecht (Buffalo State College) [55] Northern Iroquoian Ethnic Evolution: A Social Network Analysis Social relationships are integral to the human experience. Ethnicity is one kind of social relationship that archeologists explore. The evolution of the northern Iroquoian ethnic landscape has been of longstanding interest to archaeologist working in that area. Since MacNeish`s (1952) pottery typology study, the predominant model for this evolution has been cladistic. An alternative model is rhizotic. Collar decoration served as a means of signaling attributes of the potter and pottery users that mirrored other, more visible signals. We use Social Network Analysis to determine whether pottery collar decoration data best fits one or the other of these models. Hart, John [19] see Raviele, Maria E.

Hastorf, Christine (University of California-Berkeley) [227] Discussant [250] Second Organizer Hastorf, Christine [35] see Wu, Chia-Chin Hattori, Eugene [18] see Hardesty, Donald L. Hauser, Mark (Northwestern University) and Jerome Handler (Virginia Institute for the Humanities) [121] Archaeological implications for the comparison of three cottage industries: Ethnographic and documentary observations about the introduction of the Monkey and Coal Pot. Today, in a handful of Caribbean islands, persons of African descent continue to manufacture earthenware pottery. This paper compares ethnographic and historical data from Antigua, Jamaica, St Lucia and Barbados to document changes in pottery manufacture from the early nineteenth century to recent decades. The paper focuses on two distinctive forms, the so-called monkey jar and coal pot which have a wide distribution in the Anglophone and Francophone Caribbean. While the exact temporal and geographical origin of these forms are difficult to pinpoint, we argue they reflect broader trends in the physical mobility of islanders. Hawks, John (University of Wisconsin, Madison) [17] Genetic Algorithm Simulations of Stone Tool Manufacture and Cultural Transmission Paleolithic tools are cultural products, propagated by information transfer among individuals, explaining some spatiotemporal patterns of artifact manufacture. I developed a "computer knapping" model to estimate the Kolmogorov complexity of Paleolithic intermediate and final products. A genetic algorithm is progressively tuned to replication of simulated Paleolithic objects. Altering the fracture dynamics and cobble size heterogeneity increases the complexity of reduction sequences necessary to reproduce types. These elements of complexity mimic some steps that facilitate observation and replication for novice algorithmic "learners". Similar strategies of core reduction may address the complementary problems of heterogeneity and information transfer. Hawks, John [108] see Kissel, Marc Haws, Jonathan (University of Louisville), Bryan Hockett (US BLM), Nuno Bicho (Universidade do Algarve) and Caroline Funk [4] Late Pleistocene Environmental Change and Human Occupation of Lapa do Picareiro (Portugal) Lapa do Picareiro has provided an intact stratigraphic record between 8,000-35,000 cal BP with undated deposits below. This provides a unique opportunity to recover key data to understand human settlement patterns, technology, paleodiet within a paleoecological context. The cave has numerous cultural and noncultural layers that contain faunal, floral, lithic and sedimentary information needed to test models for the process of modern human colonization of Portugal and Southern Iberia in general. Here we present results of the 2008-2010 field seasons. Hayashida, Frances (University of New Mexico), Neil Duncan (University of Missouri), David Goldstein

(University of South Carolina) and Luis Huamán (Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia) [93] Agriculture, Plant Use, and Political Change on the Late Prehispanic North Coast of Peru The Proyecto Ynalche investigates late prehispanic agriculture on the Pampa de Chaparrí on Peru`s north coast. The pampa was first cultivated during Sicán rule in ca. AD 900, when agriculture was largely managed from the bottom up by farming communities. Conquest by first the Chimú and later the Inka resulted in state control of agriculture. Recent fieldwork examined how this transformation affected day-to-day life through excavations of Sicán and Chimú/Inka domestic contexts. Plant remains (macrobotanical, pollen, phytoliths) were collected and analyzed to investigate changes in economy and landscape. In this paper, the results of these analyses are reported. Hayden, Brian (Simon Fraser University), Suzanne Villeneuve (Simon Fraser University) and Rolf Mathews (Simon Fraser University) [176] New Interdisciplinary Investigations into the Emergence and Collapse of Keatley Creek New research directions at Keatley Creek focus on debates over the timing of, and conditions surrounding, the emergence and collapse of large pithouse villages on the British Columbian Plateau. Interdisciplinary research has been developed which integrates geoarchaeological, botanical, faunal and geochronological evidence from a large sample of housepit rim middens, representing the occupation history of the village site. Digital methods of recording assist in the correlation of data and interpretation of complex rim stratigraphy. This poster outlines the key archaeological and paleoeological issues in the debate and presents results from the initial season of new excavations.

Clovis cannot be clearly defined as an archeological culture in North America, and may be better identified as an era when some behaviors were similar in the continent but geographic variability also can be seen. The Clovis era was coincidental with many selective and clustered megafaunal extinctions. Clovis-era shocks that led to the extinctions may have been preceded by preClovis foreshocks, perhaps a thousand year-long span of climatic shifts and low-level human hunting. The possible evidence for such a nearly-invisible human presence in North America is sometimes fishy but sometimes respectable, although still ambiguous. Haynes, Gary [60] see Hutson, Jarod M.

Collections Research Museum collections and archives are central to Don Fowler's research. Insuring their continued preservation is a hallmark of his professional career. Don, with Ray Thompson, saved Chaco Canyon for New Mexico. In tribute, we examine Chaco origins by revisiting pottery and textiles long hidden in storerooms. The Chaco Digital Initiative used archives to demonstrate that ritual deposits in Pueblo Bonito reflect 300 years of generational connections to the past. Our collections research shows that Chaco ritual sodalities used Basketmaker-style sandals, burden baskets, and agricultural implements as ritual paraphernalia that connected many generations of Chaco people to ancestors in the Chuska Mountains. Hayward, Michele (Panamerican Consultants), Frank Schieppati (Panamerican Consultants) and Michael Cinquino (Panamerican Consultants) [60] [Rock Art and Dating in Puerto Rico: An Examination] It has been some 17 years since Peter Roe first proposed a relative dating sequence for Puerto Rican rock art based on the seriation of anthropomorphic images from three locations. The three-fold framework has largely gone untested. Images from several welldocumented rock art sites in the last few years have added significantly to an available comparative or testable data base. We select these and other location figures to examine the utility of Roe`s sequence for ordering the island`s rock art development. Hazell, Sarah (McGill University) [159] Preliminary Analysis of Thule Occupation at Resolute Bay, Cornwallis Island, Nunavut. Under the IPY initiative between 2007 and 2009, an intensive program of field research was implemented to better understand the nature and timing of Thule occupation at Resolute Bay given its standing importance and in view of its connections to the West and recent revisions of the dates surrounding their expansion into Canada. Preliminary analysis of data from both Henry B. Collins` work and that produced under the IPY suggest in fact that a number of occupations occurred at Resolute. This paper will explore the temporal associations of the occupations and how these relate to Thule expansion. Headrick, Annabeth (University of Denver) [98] The God`s a Stiff: Visual Cues in Teotihuacan Art This paper will take a stylistic tack to explore the function of iconic and narrative forms of representation in the art of Teotihuacan. Whether the medium was stone sculpture, ceramic figurines or frescoed murals, artists consistently reserved static representational forms for the supernatural while applying freer narrative scenes to human events. Yet, in the case of high status individuals and state sanctioned entities, human representations were allowed to adopt stylistic characteristics of the divine. The result was a visual system that clearly delineated three distinct categories and carefully framed social behaviors and status. Healy, Paul [75] see Cheong, Kong F.

Hecht, Kyle [77] see Riffe, Jed Heckman, Robert (Statistical Research, Inc.) and Anna Neuzil (EcoPlan Associates, Inc) [264] Trends, Styles, and Types: Prehistoric Ceramics In South East Arizona. In southeastern Arizona, painted ceramics are characterized by broad stylistic traditions that crosscut geographic regions and traditionally defined culture areas, and defy classification in traditional type and ware categories. Researchers studying ceramics in this area tend to become narrowly focused, attempting to understand how specific ceramic traditions relate to culture areas. Instead, to be fruitful and yield meaningful results, future research on these southern ceramics should focus on stylistic trends as a means to get at broad social themes such as identity, and use technological differences to examine methods of manufacture and pinpointing loci where ceramics were manufactured.

[80] see Majewski, Teresita Hector, Susan (San Diego Gas & Electric Company) [230] Evidence for Intensification and Diversification of Activities during the Contact Period in McCain Valley, San Diego County, California The contact period in San Diego County (1769-1870) was a time of movement and change for native people. Many relocated away from towns and ranches to avoid conflicts and re-establish traditional lifestyles and settlements. In some cases, areas that had been marginally or seasonally occupied or used for the exploitation of specific resources became permanent camps and villages. This study examines McCain Valley, and site CA-SDI-4010 in particular, to evaluate evidence for an intensified, more diverse, higher-density settlement pattern during the contact period. Hedgepeth, Jessica (University of Colorado, Boulder) [5] A typological and iconographic analysis of Early Postclassic pottery from Río Viejo, Oaxaca, Mexico This poster introduces a newly created typology of Early Postclassic (A.D. 800-1100) Yugüe phase ceramics from Río Viejo in coastal Oaxaca, Mexico. The ceramics derive from non-elite households which occupied the site following a major administrative collapse (c.a. A.D. 800). I give an overview of the main ceramic types classified according to three technological modes --finewares, greywares, and coarse brownwares--and discuss the social practices associated with each mode. The poster concludes by presenting an iconographic interpretation of the Yugüe phase ceramics.

This study employs a recently developed geochemical and geological framework of paired isotopic measurements to determine the source(s) of turquoise recovered from Homol`ovi I in an effort to better understand processes of turquoise procurement and exchange during late prehistory. Selected turquoise samples are analyzed to investigate 1) if one or multiple geologic sources are represented at Homol`ovi I, 2) if intrasite dispersal patterns are evident, and 3) the associated implications regarding regional patterns of interaction and exchange in the American Southwest. Heffner, Sarah (University of Nevada, Reno) [195] Healthcare Practices of the Chinese in Nineteenthand Twentieth-Century Nevada Mining Communities This paper will discuss healthcare practices among the Chinese in Nevada mining communities during the latenineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. In addition to looking at the types of Chinese medicinal artifacts found at sites in Nevada, this paper will address the presence of Euro-American patent medicines on Chinese sites. The Chinese voluntarily adopted aspects of EuroAmerican culture such as dress and religion and EuroAmerican artifacts have been found on Chinese sites. Studies indicate Euro-American adoption of Chinese medicine, but little research has been done to address the use of Euro-American patent medicines by the Chinese. Hegberg, Erin (University of New Mexico) and Wendy Sutton (National Forest Service) [211] Risque Ranchers and Bored Shepherds: Possibilities for dendroglyph research Dendroglyphs are marvelous examples of a single event--something rare in archaeology. They also frequently provide us with convenient, precision dating carved right into the tree. A large sample of carved aspen can provide archaeologists and historians with information regarding land-use, historic grazing, literacy, ethnic identity, climate change from year to year, and more. This poster presents some potential lines of dendroglyph research using GIS. This research is based on 19 sites, representing over 300 trees, documented in the 2010 summer field season in a small area around Buckles Lake in the San Juan National Forest, Pagosa Ranger District. Hegmon, Michelle (Arizona State University) and Paul Minnis (University of Oklahoma) [53] The Local Context of Long Distance Exchange: Mimbres and Casas Grandes Great research, which provides far-ranging conclusions, advances archaeology in many ways, including by providing ideas and assumptions worthy of future examination. We examine Di Peso`s ideas and interpretations of exotica at Casas Grandes, Chihuahua. Were rooms full of exotica actually stores for exchange, as Di Peso argued, or are the exotica better interpreted as offerings? The distinction between exchange goods and offerings is developed through comparative analyses of Classic Mimbres material from a slightly earlier occupation of an adjacent area. The distinction is also supported by ethnographic literature and site formation process research.

Heidenreich, Stephan (University of Cologne) [231] Late Pleistocene Lithic Tool Assemblages in Eastern Beringia: Cultural-Chronological Disparity vs. Functional Variability Since the definition of various lithic industries in Eastern Beringia the actual sense behind this separation has not been clarified. Some researchers are convinced of cultural and/or chronological differences, others have suggested seasonal or functional variation. Evaluation of various complexes of Central and Northern Alaska and a review of their application reveal a mismatch. The archaeological record should be addressed with a transregional approach independent of cultural designations. Chronological control can only be gained through radiocarbon dating. Preliminary results of analyzed tool assemblages indicate functional variability of huntergatherer campsites. This requires a new approach, recognizing settlement pattern diversity instead of a premature interpretation of cultural differences. Heidner, William [83] see Slaughter, Mark C. Heilen, Michael [80] see Hall, John D. Hein, Anke (UCLA) [23] Prehistoric Cultures of the Liangshan District Disentangling Identities and Geographic Preconditions in a Multiregional Interaction Sphere This paper gives an overview on archaeological material from the Anning River valley in southwest Sichuan. The area is characterized by a multitude of different cultures and ethnic groups that have intermingled here since the late Neolithic. Furthermore, it is crisscrossed by many rivers that dissect it into ecologically very different subregions but also connect it to other areas far north and south. Therefore, it is especially well-suited for research on identity groups and their relation with and expression in their local environment. Moreover, the material provides an opportunity to reconsider general questions of cultural contact and ethnic identity. [23] First Chair [23] Second Organizer Heindel, Theresa [8] Seeking durable indicators of manioc processing: scrapers. During the 2009 excavations conducted near Ceren, a dacite scraper was found in a midden located within Operation P. Analyses indicated that the working edge of the scraper showed substantial and distinctive usewear, including abrasions consistent with the working of material covered in dirt or grit. The present study attempts to replicate the abrasion seen on the Operation P scraper by using a replicated scraper in conjunction with Ilopango volcanic ash to remove the cortex from manioc. Results should provide information on this unique type of usewear, and add to our understanding of cultivated manioc processing at Ceren.

complex reveals that cosmological beliefs and empirical environmental phenomena were not discrete subjects for ancient peoples of Mesoamerica. Rather, empirical observations dialectically informed cosmological and metaphysical knowledge. An analysis of geological and meteorological phenomena combined with interpretations of iconographic materials suggests that, for ancient Mesoamericans, environmental observations formed a base constituent of cosmological models. Furthermore, some cosmological models may have served as functional diagrammatic representations of critical environmental processes.

A good understanding of the current literature that describes these processes and their affect on starch grains is vital for accurately interpreting the starch grain record. This paper discusses these processes, and outlines the areas where more research is needed. Hepp, Guy (University of Colorado) [157] The Material Culture of Early Sedentism in Coastal Oaxaca: Probable Early Formative Ceramics from La Consentida This paper discusses a collection of probable Early Formative ceramic vessel fragments from the lower Río Verde Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico. This study sheds light on a diverse assemblage that included small grater bowls, large-diameter conical vessels, some tecomates, and figurines. Despite erosion, remnant plastic decoration allows commentary on the iconographic cannon utilized on La Consentida ceramics. This paper demonstrates differences between the La Consentida assemblage and its closest chronological neighbors in the regional sequence, and provides contextual support for the argument that La Consentida is producing the first relatively well-understood Early Formative ceramics from the western Oaxacan coast.

UCSB 03-01 is characterized by distinct occupation sequences that show continuous habitation of the area from the late Neolithic (4300-4000 B.C.) through the Pre-Kerma and early Kerma periods (3900-2300 B.C.). AMS radiocarbon data, diagnostic pottery and domestic architecture demonstrate a clear horizontal and vertical stratigraphy. These results provide evidence of uninterrupted settlement during a crucial period of social transition at the florescence of the earliest Nubian Kingdom.

In this study we use oxygen and strontium isotope analyses to investigate the social identities of 19 females buried together at Túcume in northern Peru. These women have been hypothesized to be Aclla (chosen ones), master weavers and ceremonial attendants selected by the Inca and sent to regional training centres (Acllawasi). According to Spanish ethnohistoric documents these women were relocated primarily to the southern areas of the Inca Empire, and their lives were largely spent in seclusion and servitude. Although little archaeological evidence exists for the presence of this tradition in the north, Túcume may have been one such site. Heyman, Marjie [163] Analyzing Social Space:Interpreting Spatial Patterning at Archaeological Sites Using Ethnoarchaeological Data A community`s social behaviors may be inferred from its site`s spatial patterning. Spatial patterning results from the repeated actions and space use of corporate members. Ethnographic data analysis of extant horticultural groups identify common spatial patterns. Occupational density influences social behaviors and information exchange. Variation is influenced by kinship and residential layout; private and communal spaces; ecological context; and degree of residential sedentism. Archaeological correlates used to interpret spatial behaviors are predicted. A model links ethnographic observation with expected archaeological surface remains. This model is used to interpret the spatial patterning at two prehistoric horticultural communities in the American Southwest.

We find that the tools were used for woodworking, butchery, and scraping hides, in rank order; and that hafting is very common for formal Mousterian tools, especially small flakes. There is not a one-to-one correlation between general tool morphology and tool function. These data assist our understanding of Mousterian technology from the tool-user`s perspective.

Hiebert, Fred (National Geographic Society) [247] Cultural heritage protection in Afghanistan: Update on archaeology The cultural heritage of Afghanistan continues to be in peril due to poor security, lack of infrastructure, rampant looting and lack of funds for cultural heritage management. Despite this, positive developments continue to be made in this challenging environment. This includes international exhibition, repair of museum and training of museum and conservation staff, limited excavations at threatened sites, and cooperation with U.S. Army in training forces to recognize and respect cultural resources within the context of rules of engagement. Future steps rest on cultivation of relationships with multiple stakeholders within and beyond Afghanistan.

New research at Keatley Creek examines the timing and conditions surrounding the emergence of these complex communities and integrates data from household activities to examine changes in socioeconomy. Here GIS applications provide a well-structured descriptive and analytical tool for excavation and analysis and allow us to integrate new information with over 20 years of excavations data. Results illustrating how these tools assist in identifying spatial patterns, housepit formation processes and understanding site-wide occupation are provided.

Higelin, Ricardo (ENAH) [95] Estudio bioantropológico de Atzompa a partir de las muestras óseas recuperadas en Tumbas. Durante el año 2007 ­ 2009 el Proyecto Arqueológico del Conjunto Monumental de Atzompa, Oaxaca; realizó trabajos de excavación de enterramientos humanos, así como el análisis de los materiales esqueléticos en laboratorio. Cabe mencionar que varios restos esqueléticos obtenidos en entierros directos se encontraron en mal estado de conservación mostrando poca información sobre la serie osteológica. Por tal motivo, esta presentación tiene como objetivo principal, conocer y exponer las características bioantropológicas de los restos esqueléticos humanos recuperados únicamente en tumbas; rescatando información sobre las características físicas de la población prehispánica de Atzompa. Higgins, Howard (TRC Environmental Corp.), Christopher Watkins (Arizona State University) and Glen Rice (Rio Salado Archaeology LLC) [158] Petroglyphs and Pilgrimages; A Perspective from the Gillespie Rock Art Complex Archaeological work has documented both Hohokam and Patayan residence at the Gillespie Dam site near Gila Bend, Arizona (Watkins and Rice 2009). Across the Gila River from the village is the 4 km long Gillespie Dam Rock Art Complex containing many oversized and very visible monumental glyphs. The petroglyphs include a combination of the Hohokam Gila stylistic tradition, and the Patayan Sears Point stylistic tradition. This public display includes examples of large elements pecked over each other. It is argued that the rock art served as public statements of life in a plural community where separate group identities were maintained. Hildebrand, Elisabeth (Stony Brook University) and Timothy Schilling (Washington University In St. Louis) [246] Social and Economic Significance of Early Storage Pits on Sai Island, Sudan Early storage pits in the Nile Valley and nearby areas (Fayum) are associated with the spread of plant food production. Some scholars suggest these innovations initially aimed to preserve seasonal surpluses and ameliorate unpredictable year-to-year resource fluctuations. Through time, storage pits and seasonal surpluses may have been co-opted by incipient elites as a means of aggrandizement. On Sai Island, a storage facility had >100 subterranean pits; some, sealed since ~4150 bp, contained the area`s earliest known domestic plants. Archaeological data suggest these pits were created and maintained by small social units in the context of household-scale economies. [246] First Chair Hildebrandt, Tod (Utah State University) [179] High Elevation Adaptations in the Late Prehistoric Great Basin A recent survey on the East side of the Toquima Range in central Nevada encountered a series of 10 rock rings that represent a late archaic occupation of Pine Creek. The Pine creek drainage serves as a least cost path to Alta Toquima village. Preliminary survey and subsurface testing hints that this site may represent an archaic subsistence strategy that predates the later high

elevation adaptations associated with the occupation of Alta Toquima Village. This site provides a modest, yet valuable contribution to our understanding of high elevation habitation in the Great Basin. [177] see Jones, Emily Lena Hildebrandt, William (Far Western Anthropological Research Group) and Kelly McGuire (Far Western Anthropological Research Group, Inc.) [11] A Land of Prestige During much of the Early and Middle Holocene, people lived in small residentially mobile groups. Larger more permanent settlements developed later and were accompanied by increased gender differentiated work organization, storage, inter-regional exchange, and logistical access to distant patches. The costs of obtaining commodities through exchange and logistical transport were often higher than for resources closer to home, indicating that the non-local items represented alternative, non-energetic currencies used to increase prestige and fitness. By focusing on these relationships, and the behavioral ecological theory that explains them, we can improve our understanding of the rich character of California's prehistory.

We propose a model of Core Decay along the lower Salt River Valley in which multiple environmental and social factors operated in a systematic manner to amplify difficulties. Population coalescence and irrigation constraints led to environmental degradation and declining productivity in core areas near canal intake locations. Consequent production effort tended to more distant locations where conflict with recent immigrants ensued. Ultimately, the costs of irrigation system maintenance and social tension contributed to collapse and depopulation. Hill, Brett [52] see Lyons, Patrick D.

Some of the key spatiotemporal trends are highlighted. Hilton, Michael (Black Hills National Forest) [92] Lime Plaster Floors­Or Not? A Call for Caution Regarding Field Interpretations Thin, light-colored stratigraphic units encountered in archaeological contexts are frequently assumed to represent the sedimentological signatures of lime-plaster floor sequences. While such interpretations are often accurate, caution must be exercised. This study utilizes thin-section petrography to examine a series of undisturbed sediment samples from the southern coast of Israel. Microscopic analysis demonstrates that the physical properties that characterize lime plaster are sometimes absent. A significant number of the lightcolored strata are composed exclusively of dense accumulations of translucent opaline phytoliths which produce a hue and color value nearly identical to that of plaster floors. This analysis has significant implications for interpretations proffered. Hirshman, Amy (West Virginia University) and Christopher J. Stawski (Michigan State University) [38] Paddlers and porters: moving Late Postclassic Tarascan ceramics to market Archaeological study of Tarascan ceramics from the Lake Pátzcuaro Basin, Michoacán, Mexico, indicate localized production and market exchange. What is not known, however, is the relationship between this localized production and the trade economy within the Basin. There is conceivably a direct relationship between trade and travel and the logistics behind the production, movement and use of ceramics. Drawing from archaeology and ethnography, this paper models transport costs within the larger context of the ceramic economy in the Basin during the Late Postclassic Tarascan state.

We present a case study of the use of magnetometer survey and geochemical soil analysis on a large

archaeological site west of Hudson Bay, in order to illustrate how these techniques can complement more traditional approaches to understanding northern sites. Both techniques have great potential in Inuit archaeology as they provide information about the differential use of space that cannot be accessed through other means.

Pottery sequences may be temporally imprecise, reuse of materials is common, deposits are often disturbed, and preservation of organics is poor in moist, jungle environments. Lime mortar and plaster technologies have been used in Mesoamerica for millennia and surviving structures with samples are relatively common. Direct radiocarbon dating of mortar and plaster holds great potential but our attempts have generated few successes. Here we review radiocarbon dates and summarize lessons learned from studies of lime-based materials at Teotihuacan in Central Mexico and numerous Maya sites in Guatemala. Hoekman-Sites, Hanneke (Florida State University) [19] Resource Intensification in Early Village Societies: Dairying on the Great Hungarian Plain I examined early dairying practices on the Great Hungarian Plain during the Neolithic and Copper Age (6000-3000 cal BC) to identify how milk product use changed through time. The results of this analysis will yield information about patterns of dairy residue distribution across individual sites and in various vessel types. The impact of this project reaches beyond the confines of residue analysis. By providing information about general trends of animal product use over time, our knowledge about the process of economic intensification in Eastern Europe will be greatly expanded. Methodological issues will also be addressed.

Hoffman, Laura (SWCA Environmental Consultants) [186] Differential Access to Resources and the Emergence of Elites: Obsidian at La Blanca This paper presents the results of a comparative analysis of obsidian artifacts recovered from five household contexts at La Blanca. Although situated in the shadow of Guatemala`s volcanic mountains, the denizens of La Blanca had limited access to obsidian; this presents a unique opportunity to examine differences in access to this valuable resource. The distribution of obsidian at La Blanca reflects the emerging dominance of the nascent elites as well as the resistance of non-elites to the loss of household autonomy. This paper explores this dichotomy and its effects on the development of regional complex social systems. Hofkamp, Anthony (Portland State University) and Virginia Butler (Portland State University) [178] Ground truthing the use of radiographic analysis of annular growth rings for age determination in Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus sp.) Since the 1980's, radiographic methods have been employed for age determination and species identification of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus sp.) vertebrae from Northwest Coast archaeological sites. This method involves counting incremental growth structures, which hypothetically represent one year of growth. Our study tests this approach using modern vertebrae from two species of Pacific salmon (O. kisutch and O. tshawytscha) with known ages-of-death based on tag ages. Discrepancies varied between 4 and 62 % for the species. We consider the reasons behind the high error rate and future work needed to extend the value of increment analysis to archaeological and fisheries science research. Hofman, Courtney (University of Maryland), Jesus Maldonado (Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute) and Torben Rick (National Museum of Natural History) [105] Mice and Man: Ancient DNA Analysis of Deer Mice from Daisy Cave, San Miguel Island, CA California Channel Island ecosystems have been influenced by human activities for over 10,000 years. The Island deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), one of few endemic island mammals, appears to have replaced an older and now extinct deer mouse (P. nesodytes) during the Holocene. P. maniculatus may have been unintentionally introduced by Native Americans, but questions remain about the relationship between the two species. Genetic analysis of archaeological deer mice from San Miguel Island provides data on the relationship between ancient and extant Peromyscus. These data demonstrate the importance of ancient DNA analysis for investigating a variety of archaeological and environmental issues. Hofman, Courtney [105] see Jagani, Sheel A.

Although significant research has focused on the "Classic Maya Collapse", fewer studies have focused on the processes of social reorganization and regeneration in the Classic to Postclassic transition at the level of households and communities. This poster will present the results of excavations of commoner housegroups at Baking Pot, a center that was occupied into the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic, and discuss community integration during this period of social change.

By comparing the quantity of cortex on the cobbles and in the archaeological assemblages it is possible to show that large, thin flakes were removed from the locations where they were knapped. What was removed depended on raw material form, reduction technology and anticipated artifact use. The significance of selecting flakes that were not retouched is considered in relation to assemblage variability and assessments of technological organization.

But neuropsychological research shows that the ability to conceptually and physically grasp a tool is hardwired in primate brains. Tool creation is based on the perception of function in form. This paper discusses a qualitative study of the behavior of archaeologists as they replicated Pleistocene bone technology. Their spontaneous identification and use of expedient tools is explained using the concept of affordance. The analysis is then expanded to suggest an approach to identification and

Another nearby site, Scott Spring, was first discovered by a USGS geologist, Glenn Scott in the early 1950s. He collected mammoth, camel and horse bone from spring deposits and loess including one camel bone that may have been modified by humans. Test excavations in 2010 discovered more late Pleistocene faunal elements in loess near the spring that appear to have been modified by humans.

Holliday, Vance (University of Arizona) [155] Geoarchaeology and Paleoenvironments Of The Clovis Occupation in the Southwestern U.S. and Northwestern Mexico Clovis sites the SW U.S. and NW Mexico are found in a variety of settings. Kill/butchery sites are located in loworder tributaries of main streams in what were once wetland settings. Camps are in uplands in proximity to the tributaries or to paleo-lakes. Mainstreams (Rio Grande, San Pedro River) were quasi-stable just before, during, and just after the Clovis occupation. Lake levels for this time in paleo-lake basins with evidence of Clovis occupation (Estancia, San Agustin, Jornada del Muerto, Willcox) are poorly dated, but none provide evidence for high stands. Stable isotopes indicate relatively cool but warming conditions. [120] see Sanchez Miranda, Guadalupe Hollimon, Sandra (Santa Rosa Junior College) [16] Bioarchaeological Approaches to Non-Binary Genders: Case Studies from Native North America Recent research has begun to explicitly address the relationship between biological sex and cultural constructions of gender. Queer theory, theories of embodiment, and the body as material cultures are developments that inform this research. The biocultural interactions of sex and gender equip bioarchaeology perhaps uniquely to identify non-binary genders in the archaeological record. It has been suggested that nonbinary genders have a great time depth in North America, and that the colonizing populations who migrated from northeastern Asia recognized more than two genders.

No standing structures remain except house platforms built into the mountain. Domestic material recovered includes: ceramic, glass, clothing fragments, and personal items. Since interaction with the public is a vital part of archaeology, this presentation focuses on the small artifacts or things not usually seen by the public to highlight the potential of these small things to illustrate large concepts.

Results from cooking maize with heated limestone suggest this nixtamalization, or lime treatment, produces beneficial results when compared to simply boiling the maize. The levels of Tryptophan, Lysine, and Methionine are significantly higher in extracts of protease-treated maize boiled with limestone than in the control group. Physical evidence from limestone heated in the lab versus Basketmaker II archaeological limestone from a Cedar Mesa midden indicates that Basketmaker II people subjected limestone to levels of heat sufficient to produce slaked lime. Holt, Haley (Tulane University) [38] Enclave or Emulation?: Identifying and Investigating Zapotec Presence in the Tula Region of Central Mexico The Oaxaca Barrio of Teotihuacan, a well investigated example of an archaeologically known enclave, represents not an isolated occurrence, but rather is part of a network of Zapotec-related occupations around the Basin of Mexico during the Classic Period. Several sites near Tula, Hidalgo exhibit pottery and tomb structures with apparent Zapotec influence. Recent analyses of ceramic collections from the site of El Tesoro/Presa Escondida have brought to light interesting stylistic connections between the Tula region the Valley of Oaxaca, as well as Teotihuacan. This paper presents the results of these preliminary analyses as well as future research goals.

[254] First Chair [254] Second Organizer Homburg, Jeffrey (SRI/University of Arizona), Jonathan Sandor (Iowa State University) and Paul Minnis (University of Oklahoma) [223] Soil quality of ancient terraced agricultural fields of Chihuahua, Mexico Agricultural soil quality of ancient field systems was investigated as part of an interdisciplinary study of the anthropogenic ecology of Medio period (~A.D. 12001450) fields near Casas Grande. We compared the soil quality of fields in high versus low population valleys and between fields thought to have been owned by chiefs. A number of statistical differences were identified, but there is no indication that agriculture reduced soil quality, so soil degradation does not explain the ultimate decline of the Casas Grande cultural system. Soil differences, however, were found between fields, likely due to geologic differences in the parent material. Homburg, Jeffrey [199] see Sandor, Jonathan A. [151] see Douglas, Diane L. Hood, Angela (University of Cincinnati) and David Lentz (University of Cincinnati) [8] One Person's Trash is Another's Treasure: A Paleoethnobotanical Approach to Reconstructing Plant Use Practices at Cerén Excellent preservation conditions at Cerén grant a detailed view of ancient Maya plant use and agricultural practices. This replete record extends south of Cerén`s center, where agricultural fields were preserved beneath tephra from the Loma Caldera eruption. A midden uncovered among these fields yielded abundant carbonized paleoethnobotanical macroremains, and this paper focuses on results of their analysis. The intersection of macroremain data with plaster casts of plants preserved in Cerén`s agricultural fields and habitation area presents an opportunity to test the methodological significance and reliability of carbonized macroremains, often the major vestiges of plant use practices at Maya sites. Hood, Angela [119] see Lentz, David L. Hopkins, Nicholas (Jaguar Tours) [157] The Origin of the Southern Mayan Languages The Southern Mayan languages (Mayan minus Huastecan and Yucatecan) display an interesting pattern of distribution that suggests a history of out-migrations from a common source. Applying the principles of analysis developed by linguists for such cases and taking into account the genealogical relationships of the languages, this paper identifies the probable homeland and describes the hypothetical routes of dispersion that resulted in the observable patterns of diversification. Seen in the context of the archaeological record, the chronology of the linguistic diversification suggests the motivation for the population movements that underlie the development of the varieties of Southern Mayan. Hoppa, Kristin (University of California, Santa Barbara) [123] Terrestrial Resources During the Middle Holocene: A View from Santa Cruz Island

The role of terrestrial resources on the Channel Islands is a topic of growing interest. In geographically bounded areas with limited freshwater, such as islands, such resources may factor into settlement and mobility decisions. This paper draws on macrobotanical data from three Middle Holocene sites located on the east end of Santa Cruz Island. Coupled with faunal data from these and other sites, this study contributes to a broader understanding of Middle Holocene subsistence and mobility decisions of Channel Islands inhabitants.

Three subsequent field seasons of research have devoted countless hours to unraveling the story of that shipwreck. This account follows the various avenues of inquiry that have been pursued and the oftensurprising outcomes. While still ongoing, results of this research have already provided new perspectives on historical maritime trade, and hold the promise of more in-depth understandings of trade on the coast of West Africa. Horn, Sherman (Tulane University) [14] Constructing Complexity: Architectural expansion and social development at Middle Preclassic Cahal Pech, Belize Recent research at the site of Cahal Pech, Belize adds to the growing corpus of architecture known from the Middle Preclassic period in the Maya area. Excavations demonstrate the presence of multiple platform types buried beneath Plaza B of the site epicenter, along with architectural sequences showing the construction, expansion and elaboration of these building platforms. This paper examines the built environment of the Middle Preclassic Cahal Pech site core and the developing physical and social complexity of settlement there, at a time intermediate between the earliest settled farming villages and the rise of kingship in the southern Maya lowlands.

However, no evidence of a connection between the two skills has been demonstrated. This paper addresses this lack of evidence through experimental archaeology, specifically measuring participants aim in throwing and precision in flintknapping, to address the possibility of a correlation between the two. The information collected from this experiment could shed light on the possible evolutionary connection between throwing and flintknapping.

Los Naranjitos, an elite residential group, offers a portal into the social, political, economic, and ideological activities of its residents. A comparison of spatial organization, architecture, and material remains will situate the residents of Los Naranjitos on the socio-political spectrum of the region and will also investigate the degree of autonomy residents may have exercised, distancing themselves from ruling elites at surrounding centers.

tradition that changed with time. We use architectural data from the Museum of Northern Arizona-National Park Service joint excavation project to illuminate a building technology that was uniquely adapted to the river environment. Changes in architectural design and modification between A.D. 1050-1220 suggest a shift toward more permanent residences and an associated intensification in the number and type of architectural spaces.

Since then, similar features have been excavated at other lowland Maya sites. By their very nature, these problematic deposits resist simple classification and universal interpretation. However, they are important features for understanding the specific nature of the Terminal Classic abandonment at the sites where they occur. Using newly reported deposits for comparison, this paper reassess the significance of problematic deposits from Dos Hombres and Chan Chich with respect to the specific fates of the those two centers.

This project was designed to find new and previously recorded Rock Art sites using dstretch picture technology and pXRF. The pXRF was to determine the composition of the pictographs to understand basic composition as compared to the underlying country rock. This pXRF determination will aid in identifying pigments used by local tribes in prehistoric character and determine what materials were used in pictographs. This understanding will help to characterize trade patterns or local use of pigment materials. Howell, Cameron (University of South Carolina) [64] Airborne and Satellite Remote Sensing of Shell Middens along the South Carolina Coast Extensive vegetation studies have shown that the calcareous forests overlaying prehistoric shell middens and mounds differ substantially from vegetation on surrounding soil types. Differentiating between types of vegetation canopy coverages is possible using airborne and satellite remote sensing platforms. Using spectrographic signatures from key plant species characteristic of midden sites, the imagery can be classified and trained to identify the spectral properties of known midden sites. The model can then be applied to search for unknown sites, with the potential to expand the area of study to the Atlantic coastline from North Carolina to northern Florida.

In this paper I address some of these issues with respect to mortuary databases from the ancestral Zuni villages of Hawikku and Kechipawan. These data were collected in the 1910s and 1920s; the excavations had goals that were somewhat different than current goals. This paper explores the basic qualities of these databases and the challenges of making the data comparable to other Southwestern mortuary datasets. Howie, Linda (University of Western Ontario) [85] Intruder Alert! The provenance, technology and social meaning of foreign-looking serving vessels from Lamanai, Belize Central to the reconstruction of community patterns of ceramic production and consumption is the discrimination of locally-made from intrusive pottery. Scientific studies of vessel provenance and technology aid this objective, providing a direct means of linking pots to the landscape through their raw material ingredients and/or other technological characteristics. This information is

especially helpful when similarity in vessels` surface features and appearance does not permit obvious distinctions. This paper investigates the archaeological significance of foreign-looking monochrome black serving vessels at Terminal Classic Lamanai, demonstrating how microscopic, chemical and micromorphological analyses have contributed to understanding their social meaning.

Discussions of the economic foundations of this urbanization posit three sustainable pillars of resources (1) alluvial irrigable (2) surrounding pasturelands and (3) levee back swamps and marshes. Following a quarter-century hiatus in foreign archaeological field research in Iraq, this paper will report preliminary results of the first NSF funded geoarchaeological ground reconnaissance of the Mesopotamian delta, aimed at investigating the relative contribution of these pillars. Hu, Di (University of California, Berkeley) [49] Weaving for the Sun and the Son: a comparison of production and control in the Inka acllawasi and the Spanish obraje A cursory inspection of the Inka acllawasi and the Spanish obraje points to many similarities. They were controlled spaces primarily for the production of textiles. Both spaces functioned as institutions for religious and political indoctrination. This paper will examine both institutions through architectural, archaeological and documentary evidence to see whether the organization of production and control was fundamentally similar or different. Such a comparison will shed light on whether the Spanish regimes of labor, particularly those related to the production of textiles, represented a break or a continuation of the underlying principles of Inka labor organization.

Off road vehicles, cattle trampling, looting, vandalism, and the natural forces of wind and water are threatening the integrity of these sites. But to what degree? A recent condition assessment project looked at four sample sites across the District to gauge current conditions and provide recommendations for management action.

Hubbard, Duane (National Park Service, Southern Arizona Office), Gavin Gardner (National Park Service) and Jake DeGayner (National Park Service) [248] New Archaeological Research Resulting from Border Impacts at The National Park Service recently partnered with the University of New Mexico to preserve sites in the border region of Southeast Arizona. Over the last year, the team has encountered new discoveries and management challenges. Although some parks have been in the NPS system for nearly a century, little is known regarding the archaeological sites on these lands. In the process of relocating previously discovered sites, archaeologists also recorded resources ranging from historic structures to Archaic period camps. In an effort to curtail impacts caused by illegal border crossings and subsequent interdiction efforts, as well as natural erosion, a wide array of condition assessments, documentation, and preservation methods have been implemented. The result of this effort is the establishment of a proactive archaeological inventorying and monitoring program that includes GIS analysis, intensive archeological site mapping, in-field recordation of current impacts and implementation of preservation treatments. Hubbe, Mark (Universidad Católica del Norte) and Christina Torres-Rouff (Universidad Católica del Norte) [233] The occupation of the San Pedro de Atacama oases (northern Chile): A review of the chronology and geography of settlement through the direct 14C dating of human remains. The San Pedro de Atacama oases have been permanently occupied since approximately 4.2 kyr BP. This history is marked by distinct periods of interaction with neighboring groups and influence from foreign states (including Tiwanaku and Inca) as well as periods of relative cultural independence. Here we present 54 new AMS dates from human remains that, together with 57 previous dates from local cemeteries, allow us to review the chronological occupation of the distinct oasis districts. These data provide a better understanding of how human settlements were dispersed, including occupation and control of strategic areas and patterns of interregional interaction. Huckaby, Laurie [192] see LaBelle, Jason M. Huckell, Bruce (University of New Mexico) [94] West of the Plains: Paleoindians in the Southwest Knowledge of Paleoindian prehistory is strongly colored by work accomplished on the Southern Plains, but the North American Southwest has an equally long and important record. This paper presents an overview of what is known of these manifestations from previous and current research, and shows that Clovis, Folsom, Plainview-Goshen, Cody, and Allen-Frederick sites are all present. Data on subsistence, site type, settlement location, and mobility are presented, and suggest that these groups were resident in the Southwest for extended periods of time. This overview suggests that we have barely scratched the surface of the potential

information available. Huckleberry, Gary (Geoarchaeological Consultant) [199] What We Still Don`t Know: The Environmental Context for the Northward Spread of Agriculture 40002000 BC into the Southwest Recent research suggests that maize agriculture arrived in the North American Southwest through diffusion from Mexico in part due to climate change (increased moisture) beginning ca. 3900 BC. However, the proxy evidence for changes in Southwestern climate (e.g., packrat middens, pollen, paleoflood chronologies, laminated sediments, etc.) during the middle and late Holocene remains contradictory. The current lack of consistency between different proxy data sets limits our understanding of regional climatic-geomorphological conditions that may have influenced indigenous agriculture. Improved spatial and chronological resolution of Holocene paleoclimate and surficial geological processes is needed. Hudgins, Carter (Clemson University) and Eric Klingelhofer (Mercer University) [121] Lost and Found: Jamestown, Nevis and the Calculation of Urbanization in the Early English Caribbean Described by its governor in 1720 as a desert island to what it was thirty years ago, Nevis soon after lost its pre eminent position among England`s sugar islands. Archaeological investigations at Jamestown, one of two settlements that coalesced in mid decades of the 17th century, revealed evidence of cycles of urban resilience and revival until the decline of sugar production after emancipation obviated the need for two commercial entrepots. A high incidence of Afro-Caribbean wares and variation in vessel form signaled changes in the town`s role as well as it dependence on market and population cycles. Hudson, Nicholas [258] see Silverstein, Jay E. Huerta, Edgar (Cal State Fullerton) and Carl Wendt (California State University, Fullerton) [96] Using Petrographic Techniques to Understand the Organization of Olmec Bitumen Processing Preliminary studies on the organization Olmec bitumen processing indicate regional differences, production scale, and processing techniques. However, these studies have not involved detailed analyses of the materials added during processing. Thirty-seven archaeological bitumen thin sections from seven Olmec sites were subjected to petrographic analysis to identify the types, quantities, and sizes of materials added to the raw bitumen. Results show differences in types, quantities, and sizes of additives, within and between sites. These findings indicate different recipes and processing scale, and may reflect distinct regional variation in the organization of Olmec bitumen processing activities.

Hughes, Richard (Geochemical Research Laboratory) [230] Taming Time in the Great Basin Following the pioneering work of Heizer and Baumhoff, from 1967-1968 Billy Clewlow published a series of papers describing and chronologically ordering numerous morphological forms of Great Basin projectile points into meaningful archaeological sequence. His work was critical to establishing the temporal duration of each of these forms and creating what we call today temporal types. The projectile point chronology that Clewlow was instrumental in developing has been reaffirmed at countless archaeological sites throughout the Great Basin, has been pivotal in cross-dating otherwise undatable open sites, and has provided a chronological anchor for understanding how sites may have functioned through time. Hull, Kathleen (University of California, Merced) [11] A Land of Many People: Population Dynamics as Context and Catalyst The archaeological record of California provides unparalleled opportunities for study of long-term population dynamics of small-scale societies. This potential derives from the wealth of oral tradition, ethnohistoric, ethnographic, linguistic, and human biological data, as well as the nature of the archaeological record itself. Multi-faceted demographic studies have explored fundamental issues of population size, growth, and movement, and may also contribute to more nuanced examination of historically situated social relations in small-scale societies. The relevance of such research extends beyond the state, as case studies of foraging societies in abundant, rather than impoverished, resource areas of both coastal and interior zones.

Although all three of these San Juan Basin communities share an interest in turquoise and have Chacoan attributes, the relationship between them has remained elusive. Identifying the provenance region of turquoise artifacts and examining the extent of and patterns of turquoise procurement and exchange provides insight into the relationship between the inhabitants of these three great houses. Hulse, Eva (University at Buffalo) [181] Patterns of domestic space in Subarctic soils This study compares patterns of soil composition that

The site of Urkan e-Rub IIa, an early Kebaran Epipalaeolithic site (approximately 18,000 cal years BP) in the Lower Jordan Valley, shows evidence of specialised gazelle hunting and processing. Initial interpretations of the site argued for a multi-purpose residential base camp, supported by lithic tool and shell bead manufacturing. This paper will present faunal data that throws some question into this interpretation. This evidence suggests instead that the site was part of a logistical mobility pattern, where gazelle were procured and processed in their entirety for either immediate consumption or transport elsewhere. Hunt, Leigh Ann [57] see Mitchell, Mark D. Hunt, Robert [199] Water is not only H20: Solutions, Suspensions and Agriculture Water is widely known to be necessary for plant growth, and therefore for agriculture. Water however is not just H2O. Water as found in nature is also a set of solutions, and a set of suspensions. These solutions and suspensions can affect plant growth, and are therefore relevant for investigations of prehistoric agriculture. In this paper we focus on canal irrigated and flood water runoff fields. Attention is paid to the contents of the water. It is our objective to alert other scholars to what we do not know, and why it may be relevant for understanding agriculture.

This white-onred phenomenon crosscuts traditionally defined ceramic ware categories. We use a comprehensive database developed as part of the Southwest Social Networks Project to graph densities of white-on-red types through time and across space. We then examine the white-onred phenomenon comparatively, tabulating specific decorative and technological attributes. We postulate that this phenomenon is at least partly the result of widespread interaction and migration, and that some white-on-red varieties were distinctive markers linking diverse groups.

An often misunderstood and contested concept, TCP`s in this project emerged as more than a regulatory challenge. In this project, archaeological sites and TCP`s were one and the same, and the process of mitigation invited fresh discourse among Indian and non-Indian stakeholders concerning the value of archaeological sites and the information gathered from them.

Hurst, Winston (Bohunk Inc.) and Catherine Cameron (University of Colorado) [117] Continuity and Change: Exploring the Chaco to Post-Chaco Transition in Southeastern Utah Southeastern Utah was on the fringe of the classical Chaco world; yet during the Chaco era, communities there were often centered on great houses or quasi-great houses. The Bluff Great House and Comb Wash communities were both occupied through both the Chaco and post-Chaco eras. Investigations in these communities illuminate the nature of the Chaco to postChaco transition in this part of the old Chaco world and highlight difficulties with discerning continuity in cultural practices during this crucial time.

Rockshelters with these images are clustered in northwestern Zimbabwe, where foragers created the art between 2,000 and 4,000 years ago. Late Iron Age occupations overlying the forager levels are much younger. A nearby Early Farming

Community may date to the same time the foragers' rockshelter deposition ended. Two unknowns prevent us from reconstructing a timeline of the transition from foraging and farming: shifting paleoenvironments and changing human behaviors. The rock art may be the best starting point for understanding human societies in the Late Holocene. Hutson, Scott (University of Kentucky) [24] They Built the Road. Did the Road Build Them? Early in the Classic period in Northern Yucatan, Mexico, leaders from the site of Ucí oversaw the construction of a raised stone causeway connecting Ucí with several sites extending eastward up to 18km. The causeway functioned as a political symbol because travel required no more than a non-constructed foot path. Nevertheless, the arduous process of constructing the causeway and the high settlement density along its route suggest that the causeway did more than manifest the agenda of political actors. Rather, it helped shape political agendas and local histories, thus encouraging a symmetric analysis of people and things. Hutson, Scott [38] see Davies, Gavin R.

A pattern of interment that utilizes the northwest and southeast corners of ceremonial structures is believed to be expressions of socio-religious importance, creating continuity of space and kinship by the inhabitants. This pattern and other material culture evidence reinforce the possibility of an investment in long term, multi-generational household identity, using social memory to link the past to their present.

Human residential and individual mobility during the Late Preceramic (~7,000 ­ 4,800 B.P.) and Early Ceramic (~4,800 ­ 3,200 B.P.) periods in Central Panama have been inferred from studies of settlement size and location, and subsistence practices. At this time communities were located on the Caribbean and Pacific watersheds in several biomes. The relevance of Panama`s earliest pottery (Monagrillo) to mobility has not been evaluated. We used chemical (portable XRF and LA-ICP-MS) and petrographic analyses to infer the nature of ceramic circulation among inland and coastal communities with a mixed farming, collecting, hunting and fishing economy.

In 1671, pirates attacked and sacked the city, resulting in a fire that destroyed it entirely. Thus, a new settlement was built a few miles west, which would become the origin of the modern Panama City. This study accounts for the first archaeometrical characterization of the so-called Roja Bruñida pottery from Panama recovered in recent archaeological excavations at Panama Viejo and Casco Antiguo. The archaeological implications of this important ceramic in the Spanish colonial market in Panama is assessed. Ingraham, Robert [206] see Belknap, Samuel L. Ingram, Scott (Arizona State University) [199] What We Don't Know About Human Vulnerability to Dry Periods We don`t understand climate`s differential influence on human behavior over time and space. Thus, we cannot explain why at some times and places climatic hazards, such as dry periods, appear to stimulate behavioral responses and why at other times and places responses are not evident. I argue that a lack of progress on this issue in the Southwest is caused by insufficient empirical scrutiny of existing models of human vulnerability to climatic hazards and our reliance on an unverified assumption of resource marginality. I also present results that document the greatest vulnerability to dry periods where we least expect it.

Ives, John (University of Alberta) [94] Resolving the Promontory Culture Enigma With no small irony, Julian Steward's approach to cultural ecology (and its subsequent impact on Americanist archaeology) limited interest in his earlier assertions that the Promontory Culture was created by Apachean ancestors. With few exceptions, neither his Apachean proposition nor the inherent richness of the Promontory assemblages received the serious attention they deserved. When viewed from Subarctic and Plains perspectives, however, his Apachean proposition is well supported; irrespective of this, the extraordinary fidelity of the Promontory materials allows for remarkable anthropological insights into the AD 13th century occupants of the Promontory Caves.

The debates are an outcome of difference in the conceptual definition of a state, especially the early state in Japan. In this paper, I intend to re-examine the concepts of a tribe, ranked society, stratified society, early state, and especially chiefdom.

The Aztec obsession with turquoise, which characterizes their solar-war cult, contributed to develop long distance trade networks and affected socioeconomic system of the Southwest or turquoise mining district. The results of analysis of more than 140,000 lithic artifacts collected in and around Copan, Honduras, and Aguateca, Guatemala, suggest the procurement and distribution of obsidian polyhedral cores may have been administered by the royal court of the both cities as part of its political economy.

This is especially true of social structure as no ethnographic analogues existed in the Fremont area to provide a basis for conjecture regarding Fremont societies. Here we propose re-casting the question of Fremont social order as an aspect of the larger Southwestern farming pattern. Fundamental to that pattern are the well-documented, albeit diverse, Southwestern tribal communities that can provide a starting point for understanding Fremont society.

How far from these areas the human impact reached? Did they influence the forest composition? To find out about these questions, analyses of charcoal are done. Additional to the determination of charcoal, diameter class and growth ring analysis are carried out. Not only information about the wood composition, but further knowledge about what part of a tree was burnt and sometimes even about growth conditions is gained.

Charged events in evocative places afforded contexts for animating these effigies and facilitating their embodiment of relations with ancestral beings and landscape features. As social networks continually shifted and, in particular, the urban center of Tiwanaku emerged, older monolithic effigies came to present a community`s past and newer effigies its present. The same sociospatial moments fostering animation became equally vital for producing new types of human subjects in a context of increasingly centralized authority.

Janz, Lisa (University of Arizona) [12] Radiocarbon dating of ratite eggshell as a means of dating archaeological sites Ratite eggshell is an ideal material for radiocarbon dating and provides highly accurate dates. As such, it should be an excellent source of dates for archaeological sites, particularly those with no organic remains. Ostrich eggshell from dated and undated archaeological contexts in Mongolia and China were analyzed using AMSradiocarbon. Results suggest that in while in some circumstances, ostrich eggshell may be useful for determining the age of a site, in other cases it is not a reliable indicator. More work should be done in determining in what circumstances humans may have utilized fossil shell. [12] First Chair Janzen, Anneke (UC Santa Cruz) and J. Cameron Monroe (University of California, Santa Cruz) [177] The Dahomean Feast: Royal Culinary Practices and Animal Procurement Strategies in 18th-Century West Africa Fauna from an 18th-century Dahomean royal palace site in Cana, Bénin provides insight into royal West African culinary practices in a period of dramatic political transformation. The remains of a wide range of taxa indicate a broad array of food procurement strategies. Additionally, the low incidence of weathering, relatively high density of bones, and very tight date range for the assemblage (1775-1780) suggests a feasting event. This assemblage yields insights into the political economy of animal resources in Atlantic West Africa, and, more broadly, provides a comparative example for discussions on the nature of foodways in the African Diaspora.

The current model incorporates environmental factors such as watershed size, shoreline type, and the presence of kelp beds to predict the age of first settlement. We have expanded the model to incorporate additional variables and test, using excavation data from Old Ranch Canyon, a high ranked location on Santa Rosa Island, the persistence of permanent settlement in high ranked drainages and resource depression in this drainage prior to the expansion to less suitable locations.

Stylistic and technological differences in ceramics provide the strongest evidence for

distinguishing the two. Other diagnostic artifacts and features are not well defined due to a lack of stratigraphic integrity within most sites. Site locations and types as well as environmental and cultural data were analyzed using a geographic information system (GIS) and statistical measures. This study seeks to further understanding of the Blackduck/Psinomani transition and to demonstrate how GIS can help to understand cultural phenomena (e.g. culture change/continuity and land use) in archaeological contexts. Jenkins, Dennis (Museum of Nat. & Cult. Hist., University of Oregon), Loren Davis (Oregon State University), Thomas Stafford (Stafford Research, Inc.) and Eske Willerslev (Centre for GeoGenetics, University of Copenhagen) [262] Dating, context, and stratigraphic associations of late Pleistocene cultural deposits in the Paisley Caves of South-Central Oregon Ancient human DNA has been recovered from 16 coprolites radiocarbon dated between 12,895 and 14,370 calibrated years (10,980 ± 20 to 12,345 ± 55 BP) at the Paisley Caves in the Summer Lake basin of south-central Oregon. This paper presents new evidence of associations of artifacts, coprolites, and extinct faunal remains in the well dated Gray Sand strata of Paisley Caves 2 and 5. Chronological control is provided by a suite of 27 radiocarbon dates obtained on species identified twigs, soluble residues, single fibers from coprolites, rodent droppings, and bones. Jenkins, Sarah (Washington State University) [178] Old site, new questions: putting resource intensification to the test in the Southeastern Columbia Plateau using faunal remains from Windust Cave C (45FR46) Recent research suggests that the use of certain resources intensified in the Columbia Plateau during the Late Prehistoric period. Evidence for intensification is illustrated by the many artifacts and features related to a forager-collector lifestyle in the Southern Columbia Plateau. However, direct evidence for intensification of Artiodactyls through decreased richness and evenness and greater processing of elements for extraction of grease and marrow, has yet to be shown. I put resource intensification to the test using the findings from Windust Cave, a temporary hunting camp used from 10,000 B.P. to historic time, in conjunction with faunal assemblages from contemporaneous sites. Jennings, Justin (Royal Ontario Museum) [267] The Huarhua Rock Salt Mine: Possible Archaeological Implications of Modern Salt Extraction Practices One of the larger sources of rock salt in the south central Andes is the Huarhua mine in Peru`s Cotahuasi Valley. Although continued extraction has destroyed traces of Pre-Columbian activities within the mine itself, other archaeological evidence suggests that the salt has been exploited for at least a millennium. Mining practices have undoubtedly changed through the centuries, but Huarhua`s rock salt is still mined today by villagers working without mechanized tools. The methods and organization of modern extraction at Huarhua may therefore provide some insights into how Andean rock salt mines could have been mined, managed, and

Jennings, Thomas (Texas A&M University) and Ashley Smallwood (Texas A&M University- Center for the Study of the First Americans) [155] An Analysis of Clovis Site Types and Occupation Patterns: Exploring Homogeneity and Variability within Clovis Settlement Clovis was traditionally defined by a shared suite of technological traits, but new evidence suggests some variation within Clovis technology. This variability raises the question, was Clovis a homogenous continental-wide adaptation? Should we expect consistency in settlement patterns, or do site size and function vary regionally? This paper compares Clovis sites in North America to evaluate whether occupation patterns are consistent or variable across space. We use site area, inter-cluster distance, and artifact assemblages to infer site function and compare and contrast settlement strategies within and between regions.

Jensen, Anne (UIC Science LLC) [159] Where Great Whales Come Sailing By: Whaling Captains` Footprints on Alaska`s North Slope Whaling has long been the organizing focus of coastal North Slope Iñupiat culture. Many scholars believe that whaling was important in Thule culture prior to the Thule migration, although it has been difficult to confirm this. This paper examines the material correlates of whaling at sites where whaling is known to have taken place. It is suggested that little evidence of whaling is to be found in house interiors, which have received most archaeological effort to date. Rather, whaling-specific material culture tends to be found outside the houses proper, in some cases associated with women`s activity areas. Jerardino, Antonieta (ICREA/University of Barcelona) [253] Integrating hunter-gatherer resource intensification and feasting along the West Coast of South Africa Megamiddens dating to between 3000 and 2000 BP along the South African West Coast are interpreted within a resource intensification framework. Most protein consumed by foragers during this millennium derived from marine resources according to isotopic evidence. Raising population densities and signs of impact on local fauna between 3500 and 2500 BP are concomitant with growth stunting among coastal foragers. A later decline in environmental productivity between 2500 and 2000 BP coincides with an increase in interpersonal violence. Feasting and/or intensified ritual at nearby Steenbokfontein Cave were probably developed as a coping mechanisms to mediate social and ecological stress.

Pyramid Lake, Nevada, suggests the persistence of extinct mammoth to 10.3 kya (terminal Younger Dryas) and human utilization of fresh bone, ivory and antler for tool manufacture. This paper reviews the evidence of fishing and hunting along the receding shoreline of Pyramid Lake and the refugium that this area offered for the late survival of mammoth. Jeske, Robert (University of Wisconsin Milwaukee) [141] Red Ochre Mortuary Sites in Southeastern Wisconsin Red Ocher is a poorly understood and vaguely defined archaeological concept relating to burial sites scattered across the south and west Lake Michigan drainage. Although generally accepted as Late Archaic in age, there are few data to support chronology or most other aspects of Red Ocher sites from southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, or northern Indiana. The concept of Red Ocher is reviewed using new data from several recently excavated and newly analyzed sites in southern Wisconsin. Biological, material culture and spatial data are summarized to provide a tentative framework for placing these burials into a cultural context.

Mortuary contexts provide invaluable opportunities to assess identity formation and ideologies on display in funerary ritual. Here is discussed how political centralization can be discerned through the treatment in death of various age categories and how these in turn can reveal information about the perception of personhood in the past. Johansen, Peter (University of British Columbia) [189] Forging Social Relations, Producing Metals: Investigating Scale and Context in the Socio-material Landscape of Iron/Steel Production in Iron Age Karnataka Mortuary evidence from the South Indian Iron Age (1200300 BC) documents the materiality of iron and steel objects in the expression of social differences in death ritual. Yet far less is known about the social relations of metallurgical production itself. Here I consider ferrous metallurgy a technologically sophisticated package of land-use practices that produce a range of material objects, social relationships, and dynamic, multi-scalar, socio-material landscapes.

[189] First Chair [189] Second Organizer Johansen, Trine Bjørneboe (UC Davis) [180] Snares, nets and stone traps: Increasing foraging efficiency for small game at Iita, Northwest Greenland The utilization of snares, nets and stone traps made small animals valuable additions in the subsistence strategy of the Inughuit at the site of Iita, Northwest Greenland. Small game such as arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), arctic hare (Lepus arcticus) and dovekies (Alle alle) dominate the 24,743 faunal remains excavated at Iita. Although foraging efficiency is often measured in terms of body size this paper suggests that capturing techniques should be considered equally when discussing optimization of resources and that the presence of small animals caught in snares, nets, and stone traps may indicate an overall increase in hunting efficiency independent of prey size. Johnson, C. (Bureau of Land Management) [239] The Long-Lost Coast: Searching for Evidence of Early Coastal Migration in the King Range National Conservation Area The long-held Ice-Free Corridor theory for the initial peopling of the Americas has been challenged by a number of researchers posing a Coastal Migration model. Testing this concept is proving difficult however, due to the fact that most terrestrial coastal settings of the Late Pleistocene are inundated by higher sea levels resulting from large-scale glacial melting. Recent GIS modeling indicates only one region with tectonic uplift rates that exceed the rise of post-glacial sea levels. This paper reports on current efforts to locate, map, and test remnant marine terraces in search of evidence of coastal migration along California`s Lost Coast.

A.D. 1200-1300) have been reported on northwest Ellesmere Island and northeastern Greenland, but the route by which these groups may have entered the eastern Canadian Arctic from the Bering Strait region has never been addressed, due to lack of data. Recent excavations on southeast Somerset Island at an apparent Pioneering` Thule site suggest that these earliest groups followed a southern Arctic mainland coast/Boothia Peninsula/Somerset Island route. The implications of this research are addressed, and suggest that many more Pioneering` Thule sites in the southern Arctic mainland coast/islands are yet to be discovered and investigated.

Low ranged, structures were built at the site`s main entrance at several sites in the Southeast Mesoamerican area. These entrance structures are unique to the area and provide important insights into elite management of public areas. This poster uses three examples of these structures from El Cafetal, El Coyote and El Puente. Entrance structures controlled the access of people to these sites and were stages for public activities like feasting. Through activities such as the burial of ancestors within these structures elites symbolically and physically claimed control over access to and public ritual.

The multiplicity of languages derived from past migrations into the region and cultural adaptation to a diverse range of ecological types. Reconstructing the record of ancient migrations has been approached through techniques of linguistic prehistory, archaeology, oral tradition, morphometric measurements of skeletal anatomy, and most recently by DNA studies.

Baking Pot was primarily occupied during the Late Classic period. This paper examines how the availability of local chert conditioned the types of tools being produced. In particular, the collections contain many informal tools, including utilized flakes, partially utilized cores, choppers, and hammerstone cores. The numerous informal tools support the idea that raw material availability can affect the nature of flaked stone technologies. These data provide valuable comparative information on flaked stone technology in the Belize River Valley. Johnson, Phillip (Texas A&M University) and Eric J.

This study examines stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes in 32 radiocarbon dated burials from Tutuila, American Samoa (ca. 1600-100 B.P.). Additionally, we provide a partial food web reconstruction through stable isotope analysis of archaeofaunal remains and modern faunal and plant remains. We tested the hypothesis that marine protein consumption declined through time concomitant with increased use of terrestrial domesticates, and discuss the implications of our findings in light of current archaeological subsistence models for West Polynesia.

However, no primary deposits containing pure Middle Formative ceramics have been encountered. All Middle Formative ceramics were recovered from construction fill associated with later occupation. While the collection has some superficial resemblances to the Mamom ceramic sphere, the differences suggest that we have a separate ceramic sphere for the Northern Yucatan during the Middle Formative.

Jones, Deanna (CSU Northridge) and Anabel Ford (UCSB) [238] Mismanagement or Misrepresentation: Implications of Botanical and Faunal Data from the Maya Forest Current notions of environmental interaction by the ancient Maya suggest grave mismanagement. Ford (2008) has studied the interaction between the Maya and their landscape by analyzing archaeological and paeleoenvironmental data. Ford argues that paleoenvironmental reconstructions commonly used to study the Maya rely solely on wind pollen, which does not account for over 90% of the biotically pollinated fruit and hardwoods. The lack of complete information results in misrepresentations of the Maya, and deserves more attention. The focus of this presentation will be to test Ford`s hypothesis by evaluating flora and fauna from archaeological sites in the Maya area.

The Idaho Archaeofaunal Database is a GISlinked searchable database of vertebrate animal remains from archaeological sites in Idaho. Users can search for specific species of animals; search results consist of a map highlighting sections of Idaho that include archaeological sites containing that taxon. The project is designed to serve both wildlife managers, who can use the database for information on the historic ranges of vertebrate species as reflected by their presence in archaeological sites, and zooarchaeologists, as part of larger projects in the state of Idaho. Jones, Eric (Wake Forest University) [55] Building Swidden Agricultural Settlement Theory: Comparing the Late Woodland Northeast and Southeast Fifteen years ago, Glenn Davis Stone stated, it is not even clear what an agrarian settlement theory should look like. This was and still is strikingly true for swidden agriculture in temperate climates. Several swidden agricultural societies thrived in the Eastern Woodlands from AD 1000­1600. Studying their settlement remains and reconstructed landscapes allows us to build settlement theory for this subsistence strategy. This research analyzed the spatial patterning of Haudenosaunee sites and sites in the North Carolina Piedmont in relation to environmental and sociopolitical factors. The results suggest that defensibility, transportation, and agricultural production influenced settlement choice decisions.

Through a partnership with the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy, field classes from California State University at Fullerton conducted archaeological surveys and test excavations at Abalone Cove on the Palos Verdes Peninsula during the past four years. Results of the research are presented and comparisons are made with other coastal and island sites. Jones, George (Hamilton College) and Charlotte Beck (Hamilton College) [262] A Paleoarchaic Surface Record from Coal Valley, Nevada In 2007, exploratory reconnaissance of Paleoarchaic sites in Coal Valley, Nevada, was conducted to recover stone artifacts for source provenance analysis. We investigated three assemblages, each of which contains diagnostic tools including fluted and unfluted lanceolates, stemmed points, and crescents. Among the former is an example that compares favorably with western Clovis, while others have gracile features. The crescent sample, though small, exhibits the full range of morphological variation seen in the tool class. Source characterization of obsidian and dacite artifacts points to a strong local provenance signal. We consider these assemblages in light of questions regarding tool morphology variation, assemblage function, and Paleoarchaic mobility. Jones, George [22] see Goodale, Nathan B.

[11] A Land of Many Seasons: Bioarchaeological Signatures of the Medieval Climatic Anomaly in central California Data from 16,152 central California skeletons show strong evidence for demographic stress during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (cal A.D. 800-1350), a period marked by prolonged and severe droughts. Cultural phases that bracket the Medieval Climatic Anomaly show frequencies of enamel hypoplasia and dental caries higher than any other pre-contact period. Phases synchronous with the Late Medieval Climatic Anomaly (cal A.D. 1210-1390) show pre-contact apices in dental caries, signs of disease, and violence. Evidence of anemia is high for the late MCA although it increased afterwards. Findings suggest that unforeseen climatic downturns caused problems for California huntergatherers.

California Coast midden sites spanning the Middle to Late Holocene provide a unique perspective into marine subsistence and the dynamic nature of humanenvironmental interactions. The research presented in this paper suggests that intertidal resource communities remained relatively stable over time, perhaps the result of low population densities dispersed across the region. Small near-shore marine fish and rocky intertidal shellfish appear to have largely supported human occupation over 5,000 years without diminishing littoral productivity, demonstrating the considerable adaptive variability of coastal hunter-gatherer-fishers.

I argue that Early Postclassic ritual deposits reflect the historical rupture of the time as commoners reclaimed the sacred rites of the Main Plaza, nobles removed the remains of their ancestors, and large portions of the plaza were abandoned and erased from memory. By the Late Postclassic the history of Monte Albán`s sacred ruins was reinvented for the ideological purposes of a new noble class as the Main Plaza became a place where elite ancestors participated with gods in the creation of the current world.

I have argued that archaeologists engage in the reproduction of what Bakhtin called genres, "formshaping ideologies" that "convey a vision of the world...by developing concrete examples". I would now argue that the many innovative experiments consciously intended to change the nature of archaeological communication have not transformed the basic genres in which they are embedded. The generic uniformity of archaeology surely can be changed, but not by slight modifications in the packaging. What we need is to rethink the product itself.

Three fields revealed evidence of a complex and well organized settlement patterns, in which households were rigidly organized according to a Northwest axis. Such organization exhibits community practices that guided the distribution of land and its resources. With an emphasis on community, my research concentrates on the macro-level processes that brought households together. This research also represents a new direction

in which the Late to Terminal Classic period is treated as the emergent period of settlement. Judd, Margaret (University of Pittsburgh) [152] REMEMBRANCE, RELICS AND RECOVERY AT MOUNT NEBO, JORDAN Mount Nebo, the largest and hypothetically most cosmopolitan monastery in Byzantine Jordan, provides an opportunity to understand the structuring of the human death course among individuals united by monastic culture. The collective burials within the Robebus Chapel (A.D.530) blurred the individual biological identities, thus necessitating the method and theory of anthropogie de terrain` to disarticulate the individual from the community in order to rearticulate the experienced life and funerary deposition. Disparities in placement, processing and selective remembrance suggest that some individuals were venerated in death, yet retained their communal identity. Juengst, Sara (UNC-CH) and Sergio Chavez (Central Michigan University) [233] After the Fall: Trauma and Labor in the Late Intermediate Period at Ch'isi The Late Intermediate Period (AD1000-1450) in the Lake Titicaca region was a time of decentralization and chaotic political fluctuations. The collapse of both Tiwanaku and Wari at the end of the Middle Horizon left the political sphere open to new powers and influences, causing abandonment of sites and shifting social conditions. The Late Intermediate Period burials at Ch`isi, a Lake Titicaca temple site occupied from Yayamama times onward, reflect this cultural revolution through the pathology and trauma seen on these skeletal remains. The tumultuous political changes are directly visible on these bodies themselves.

Located in south-eastern Ukraine, Amvrosievka is a complex of Epigravettian sites - including a camp and a kill/processing site - particularly rich in bison remains. In this paper we present the results of a seasonality study based on the combined use of zooarchaeological tools, incremental study and stable isotope analysis of the bison remains from Amvrosievka. The results enable us to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the different methods.

The exhibition content was decided in community meetings. The O`odham relationship to their land was crucial to the exhibitions. Their relationship to the archaeological landscape was not deemed worthy of much exhibition space. The stories that archaeological research might tell were also not of much interest. Instead the relationship between the O`odham and their homeland was explored via community history, story, song, and lived experience.

center of Uxbenka' Studies of settlement dynamics in the Maya Lowland traditionally focused on the development of social complexity and institutionalized hierarchy. Agencies responsible for these patterns are frequently ignored. Drawn from Human Behavioral Ecology, The Ideal Free Distribution provides an empirical framework to investigate household decision making strategies over time, placing agents at the forefront of analysis. Using the Classic period polity of Uxbenka as a case study, we examine the distribution of non-elite settlement in relation to ecological and social variables. The results suggest that household level decision making, rather than political constraints, are at least partly responsible for settlement patterning.

This poster presents preliminary studies in the applicability of Fourier-Transformed Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman Spectroscopy to archaeology--the effects of potential contaminants on artifacts post-excavation. This study replicates the environments an artifact may experience in short term storage and transportation from the field into the laboratory. Modern ceramic artifacts were spiked with organics, stored in plastic and paper bags, and left in a variety of indoor and outdoor conditions for a week. Kamiya, Masahiro [35] see Thoms, Alston V.

This issue has been one of the hottest research topics among Korean and foreign archaeologists. A number of Korean scholars have taken it for granted that Korean dolmen society reached a centralized political organization. This paper based on the analyses of spatial distribution of dolmen and artifacts recovered from the burials argues that the dolmen society in the southeastern part of Korean peninsula remained egalitarian.

Thus, though web publication of data is increasingly easy to accomplish, many scholars have yet to realize the rewards of sharing their primary data.

Four seasons of intensive excavation in the 1970s retrieved a large array of ceramics, lithics, and environmental data. The lithics include a large number of points and scrapers; microwear analysis of the latter reveals hideworking traces.

Karoll, Amy (University of Arkansas) [258] Reconsidering the End of the Early Bronze Age in Western Syria Based on analysis of materials from Tell Qarqur on the Orontes River in western Syria, this paper presents new insights on the end of the Early Bronze Age (c. 22001950 B.C). Archaeological sites across the region show evidence of abandonment during this period, which some scholars have attributed to climate change. Excavations at Tell Qarqur indicate an urban expansion during the terminal Early Bronze Age with a continuous sequence of occupation well into the 2nd millennium B.C. Results suggest that abandonment of sites may not have been as widespread as previously assumed and force a reconsideration of regional settlement history.

More recent

investigations focus on cultural factors associated with the use and management of woodland resources. The late seventeenth century Mohantic Fort, located within the Mashantucket Pequot Reservation, is ideal to analyze those human-environmental dynamics. Methods, such as Minimum Piece Diameter Analysis, explore the presence of wood charcoal in different contexts, such as palisades, midden, and pit features. This data will be compared to eighteenth century Mashantucket sites and create a diachronic study of plant interactions on a changing historical landscape. Katterman, Grace [49] Puruchuco Garments from the Time of the Conquest The Puruchuco Cemetery on the outskirts of present day Lima has yielded numerous Late Horizon burials.

Katz, Sandra (University of Pittsburgh), William Engelbrecht (Buffalo State College) and Kathleen Allen (University of Pittsburgh) [164] Hearthside activities at the Eaton Site Archaeological research has revealed much about the architecture of Iroquoian longhouses, and how structural features have changed in response to historical events. However, the economic organization of the longhouse remains, by and large, a black box. This study investigated the distribution of economic activities within a prehistoric Iroquoian village, the 16th century Iroquoian component of the Eaton site. We compared the concentrations of artifacts and faunal remains from indoor and outdoor fire pits at this site, and found that complementary activities took place within and between two houses. Implications for future research on task distribution within Iroquoian villages are explored. Katz, Sandra [55] see Allen, Kathleen M.

Anthropogenic deforestation, in addition to the aridifying landscape caused by the Late Holocene climatic episode (~2300 BCE), led to the mass adoption of tin bronze by humans as a fuel saving mechanism. Investigation of the local alloy progression over an 800 year period (EBIVMBII) at the site of Enot Shuni in the Southern Levant reveals this culture`s environmental choices.

This paper explores the possibility that, based on monumental evidence at the site of Uaxactun, Orion and creation are both linked in Mesoamerica with a February nadir, or passage of the sun. This winter nadir, coinciding with the beginning of the annual agrarian cycle, was perhaps more important to ancient Mesoamericans than solstices and equinoxes. The link between the winter nadir and creation is supported by the Popol Vuh and possibly by monumental evidence at the site of Izapa. Kaufmann, Cristian [177] see Gutierrez, Maria A.

Human impacts were largely a function of natural ignition sources and population density. High elevation sites with unlimited lightning ignitions may have been little affected but just the reverse is to be expected on coastal and foothill landscapes.

was a vital component of the Maya economy at Conquest. Nevertheless, the extrapolation of a marketbased economy back into the Classic period remains controversial largely for two reasons: (1) a lack of undisputed archaeological evidence for marketplaces, and (2) a perception that the documented Classic Maya system of tribute and gift exchange was inimical to market trade. This paper presents recent archaeological evidence for physical marketplaces at Classic Maya sites, and posits a reconceptualization of the Classic Maya moral economy which incorporates tribute and gifting alongside elite-controlled markets.

However, this assumption is rarely tested because our ability to reconstruct human demographic change has been limited. With a new method developed by Surovell et al (2009, J. Arch.

Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wear on experimental microliths is compared to LSA microliths from the site of Erb Tanks, western Namibia. Microscopy demonstrates that microwear in the LSA assemblage resulted from transport or bead drilling, rather than projectile impact.

Archaeological households are often identified by architectural comparisons within a site or a region. However, in the absence of surface remains, what tools do archaeologists have for recognizing households? At the Inka site of Cheqoq, northwest of Cusco, we are examining lithic tools and debitage to better identify houses in relation to other contexts such as public structures, multi-use precincts, and a ceramic production workshop. This analysis of microartifactual remains from flotation heavy fraction and hand recovered lithic debitage and objects looks at ubiquity and percentage measures, as well as significance tests to establish patterns of household and site-level organization.

We analyze two specific episodes of demographic change: the 16th century decline resulting from the Spanish invasion, and the 19th century decline produced by Yucatan`s Caste War. Archaeological evidence shows that the rate of 16th century decline was less severe than documentary sources suggest.

Obsidian and Iron Use and Exchange in Pre-Islamic Highland Yemen Three decades of research have produced a register of sites and a landscape record spanning the Neolithic through Himyarite periods. Recent geochemical analyses of archaeological obsidian provide data for a diachronic model of local obsidian exchange. Consequently we can identify both continuity and shifts in exchange networks within the context of environmental, cultural, and political changes and confirm Yemen`s role as a major source zone in Arabia. Parallel archaeometallurgical analyses of iron production debris from later Himyarite contexts where obsidian consumption declined, have added to a broader picture of the long-term dynamics of resource and technological strategies.

[192] Fire, Foragers, and Ecological Mythology Archaeological and ecological research in the last 10 years has brought to light the many ways in which humans interact with their environment. However, these studies have largely emphasized the impacts of agricultural and industrial economies at the expense of small-scale societies like hunters and gatherers. Sedimentary evidence from the Great Basin and the Congo Basin provides an opportunity to explore the fundamental problem of how researchers generate meaningful hypotheses about human foragers and their environment. These hypotheses are especially important because they challenge popular mythology about environments, human behavior, and the role of fire in ecosystem management. Kidder, Barry (Texas State University-San Marcos) [266] The Chthonic Canvas: Elite Maya Scribes, Portals of Power, and Artistic Production in the Late Classic Period Iconographic and epigraphic analyses show elite Maya scribes were envisioned as creator deities that could contact and transform into a specific pantheon of gods through shamanic rituals. These gods associated with the artistic class were denizens of the Underworld and were thought to reside in apertures of sacred landscapes such as caves and cenotes. Thus, elite Maya scribes adopted the multivocal symbol of the cave as a medium to bolster their perceived supernatural abilities and reinforce their prestigious sociopolitical position in the face of increased horizontal and vertical social complexity. Kidder, Tristram (Washington University) and Min Li (Peking University/Washington University in St. Louis) [133] Geoarchaeology of China's Pompeii: The Sanyangzhuang Site, Henan Province The focus of geoarchaeological research at Sanyangzhuang is to understand the geological context of the site and the nature of the flood that buried the Han occupation. Research shows the site area has a complex geological history in which the Yellow River has been the dominant force through the 13th century C.E. The landscape history reveals multiple episodes of long-term stability starting at the end of the Pleistocene and punctuated by flood events and periods of landscape instability. These patterns tell us much about the evolution of the Yellow River floodplain and its relationship to human settlement during the Holocene. Kieffer, C. L. (University of New Mexico, Maxwell Museum) [56] One Cave, Many Contexts: The Skeletal Deposits from Midnight Terror Cave, Belize Although cave contexts in the Maya area often have excellent preservation, activities in the past and present make analysis of skeletal deposits in difficult. This paper outlines a more holistic approach that can be used to determine the differences between different mortuary activities in caves based on associated remains, osteological analysis, and contextual analysis. Examples from Midnight Terror Cave will be used to demonstrate that a single explanation of utilization cannot be used for an entire site. Rather multiple types of mortuary practices are possible, including primary and secondary deposits,

ancestor veneration, and sacrifice. [266] see Krasnec, Katina V. Kielhofer, Jennifer [262] see Smith, Geoffrey M.

Kilby, David (Eastern New Mexico University) [155] A Regional Perspective on Clovis Blades and Caching Behavior In 1963, F. E. Green reported the discovery of 17 blades at Blackwater Draw, NM, proposing that Upper Paleolithic-style blades were characteristic of Clovis technology and that this particular collection of blades had been cached near a small stream at the site. In the nearly 50 years that have passed since this landmark discovery, sufficient data have accumulated to indicate that regional patterns exist for both Clovis blade manufacture and Clovis caching. This paper explores the relationship between blade technology and caching behavior at a regional scale, offering potential explanations for where they occur and where they do not.

Early to Middle Bronze Ages. The transition in centralwestern Korea witnessed emergent complexity and incipient regional-scale political economy accompanied by rice-agricultural intensification. The socioeconomic changes followed and/or paralleled with competitive construction of dolmens that traditionally functioned as territorial markers and symbols of collective rituals. However, overheated competition between local leaders, regional-elite-to-be seems to have led erroneous investment as analyzing distributional patterns of dolmens with reference to soilscpaes reveals. Kim, Minkoo (Chonnam National University) [25] Agroforestry in the Ancient Mahan States of Korea Carbonized and waterlogged wood remains from nine archaeological sites are examined in order to shed light on the management practices of tree species during the Mahan period (ca. 100 B.C. to A.D. 500). The analysis provides evidence of a shift in wood composition after the establishment of the Mahan states, especially a dominance of chestnut (Castanea crenata). Chestnut proliferates in the secondary forest around village, usually under human intervention. The current study suggests that people of the Mahan states exerted control over the propagation of chestnut trees, and that this plant was an important source for fuel, construction materials, and food. Kim, Nam (University of Wisconsin-Madison) [23] Construction and Population Estimates for the Co Loa Site in Vietnam The Co Loa site in Vietnam`s Red River Delta is believed to be one of the first capitals of Vietnamese civilization. Recent archaeological investigations have demonstrated that the site was likely founded sometime during the third century BC, lending support to Vietnamese oral traditions regarding an indigenous, early state-like society. This paper presents additional research highlighting the construction requirements for the site`s monumental system of fortification features, along with estimates for the site`s population size during the Iron Age. The data have implications for the type of polity responsible for founding and constructing the proto-urban site.

In our study into the function of Mousterian flint tools from Weasel Cave, we employ the atomic force microscope (AFM) and the optical profile interferometer, in addition to the light microscope and the SEM. The advantage of the AFM and the interferometer are the extremely high resolution permitted and most importantly the quantitative data extracted from microwear polishes. The merits of these different instruments are discussed in the context of polish differentiation for microwear traces on archaeological specimens interpreted as due to contact with meat, fresh hide, dry hide, bone, wood, as well as

hafting. Kimball, Larry [108] see Hidjrati, Nazim [108] see Koetje, Todd A.

Two years of excavations at Aguacate Uno highlight the area`s location along important transportation routes running from the Peten to the Yucatan. The Aguacate region is imagined as a dynamic semi-autonomous polity playing a vital role in interregional commerce. The sites sit on the edge of escarpments between the major centers of El Pilar and Lamanai. We suggest that El Pilar may have derived its power from ties to the wealthy Aguacate settlement region.

Despite their importance, the temporal place of the cemeteries within the Middle Woodland period has remained unexplored. In this paper, I present eight new radiocarbon dates from the Pete Klunk site. These data are analyzed with recent assays from the Gibson site in order to identify intra- and intersite sequences of moundbuilding and temporal change in funerary practices. Results are then placed in the context of regional expressions of Middle Woodland mortuary behavior.

The Delegation Two-Step and the CERCLA Shuffle The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency avoids protecting historic places in two major ways. First, it delegates many functions to the states, and doesn't require them to address the requirements of laws like the National Historic Preservation Act. Second, it invokes the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) to exempt itself from the "procedural" requirements of most environmental laws. Despite its ostensible mandate to "protect" the "environment," EPA has been able for decades to slither out from under doing anything about archaeology and historic preservation.

Nonetheless, in the last few years there is a growing consensus that the first colonizing population of the Neotropical region did so with a broad-spectrum subsistence economy, and that Amazonian anthropogenic soils is a crucial record for understanding this process. Here we present evidences for early and middle Holocene cultivation of local crops

by pre-ceramic groups in the upper Madeira River, such as rich-organic soil and artifacts associated with plant processing. Kirakosian, Katie (UMass Amherst) [27] Getting Back to our Roots: Using Ethnography to Better Understand the Archaeological Record In order to understand the significance of shell middens in southern New England, ethnographic research was employed in this dissertation project. Members of the Native descendant communities and Non-Native experts were interviewed about the current meaning and significance of these places on the landscape as well as possible significance and meaning for the Pre-Contact creators of these sites.

Since 2007, the Hawaii Biocomplexity Project has archaeologically investigated household sites, in two territorial units of Kohala District, Hawaii Island. Our objective has been to elucidate the role of households -- of both commoners and elites--in the late precontact evolution of Hawaiian society. This paper offers an overview of the project, including our theoretical orientation and presentation of key findings. The results of household archaeology in Kohala support a shift from a domestic mode of production to a more integrated political economy including specialized production. [261] see Mills, Peter R.

This leads credence to the 'Homo helmei' hypothesis, a hominid species whose existence is based upon the appearance of Mode 3 tool types and the Florisbad cranium. We examine whether the behavioral record is consistent with this idea, and then reevaluate it in light of new fossil and genetic data. Rather than positing a new species, the data suggests there is no evidence for an increase in inter-regional diversity over time, as predicated by the hypothesis Kitchel, Nathaniel [155] see Gingerich, Joseph A.M.

Klar, Kathryn (University of California, Berkeley) and Terry Jones (California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo) [11] A Land Visited: Reasserting the Case for Polynesian Contact in Southern California Many American archaeologists continue to resist the idea of prehistoric Polynesian landfall in the New World largely on the basis of chronological issues and an unwillingness to accept linguistic evidence as a critical complement to the archaeological record. Here we supplement our original linguistic and archaeological case with previously overlooked artifactual evidence including compelling stylistic similarities in bone and shell fishhooks, and newly located Chumashan language data. These results address the chronological questions, and make the linguistic case even more difficult to explain by any conclusion other than face-to-face contact between ancient Polynesians and Native Americans.

Specifically, we focus on the relationship between sources, technological style and value in the modern potting community of Pucará in the northern Titicaca Basin and a Late Formative (200 BC- AD 300) archaeological example from the Taraco Peninsula in the southern basin. We focus on the issue of sourcing prehistoric pastes in a dynamic geological environment, and question how issues of value and ownership, so central in the ethnographic present, can be studied in the past. Klaus, Haagen (Utah Valley University) and Izumi Shimada (Southern Illinois University) [156] Bodies and Blood: Evidence and Interpretation of Middle Sicán Human Sacrifice on the North Coast of Peru, A.D. 900-1050 Excavations within the Middle Sicán heartland of northern Peru have revealed previously unknown diversity of sacrificial practices during the Late Intermediate Period. Multiple forms of evidence define at least two traditions of ritual killing spanning intentionally unmutilated victims associated with high-status funerals and temple dedications; blood sacrifice-related throat slitting, chest opening, decapitation, and stabbing of mostly subadults predominated in rural settings. We consider potential symbolism, implications for the multiethnic structure of Middle Sicán society, and how ritual killing shifted away from Moche-era warrior sacrifice

towards more generative forms of violence likely preoccupied with water and fertility in the living world. [217] Discussant Klaus, Haagen [156] see Perez, JoEllen M.

This paper concerns proposed excavations at three Iron Age sites around Bosutswe, Botswana, the longest continuously occupied African polity south of the equator. While the cultural stratigraphy of Bosutswe is well known, its development needs contextualization in relation to its vicinity, supporting and perhaps competing sites.

Models based on optimal foraging theory have been extensively used to explain Pleistocene shell accumulations as evidence for maritime resource exploitation in scarcity times. However, Holocene shell sites do not necessarily fit within this framework. Researchers have realized that some of these structures could have been intentionally built and that the force behind construction was derived from ritual. We intend to explore the role of feasting in the development of some sites and discuss the possibility to combine both views of resource use.

Human behavioral ecology principles are used to generate a model depicting seasonal variations in land-use and subsistence organization in different environmental zones. The model is tested using diet breadth, kill size, seasonality, and lithic raw material provenance data from 56 Late Paleoindian sites.

Resolving these conflicts is often hampered by our inability to visualize the nature of the conflict. In the case of Civil War battlefields, urban development tends to fragment these landscapes. This process was modeled on eleven battlefields.

As human populations aggregate, they begin to enhance and formalize social relationships through the construction and manipulation of supra-household institutions that help shape human behavior and synchronize human activities across space. Yet how exactly does the institutionalization process perpetuate itself over time? Results from Hawai`i indicate that certain forms of the built landscape, particularly temples and boundary markers, were instrumental in communicating and solidifying the social norms necessary for negotiating new forms of aggregated settlement.

Of the nine individuals, five were males (15-50 years old). Among the five males, 60% present antemortem cranial trauma, and none exhibit perimortem cranial fractures.

Artifacts below a 10,000 year-old peat deposit at the Bear Creek site near Seattle are the first Pleistoceneaged materials found in situ in the Puget Sound Lowlands of Western Washington. Preliminary excavations yielded a lithic assemblage characteristic of both Clovis and Western-stemmed Paleoindian projectile point traditions, debitage indicative of discrete reduction episodes, and protein residue data on stone tools reflecting subsistence on a variety of terrestrial mammals and salmonids. Coupled with environmental and geoarchaeological data, the assemblage suggests settlement at the confluence of lake and stream after glacial retreat and prior to wetland formation at the end of the Pleistocene.

Using recent archaeological data from Cusco, Perú, I examine how labor practices that constructed, converted, and demolished pre-Inka objects and places ultimately worked to mobilize early Inka political claims to historicity and social difference. By building colossal walls, destroying valued objects, and monumentalizing longrevered shrines, social actors of the Cusco area recast select places and objects as specifically Inka, thereby producing an Inka landscape and social order to which they themselves were subject. In these situated practices of material transformation, a new political era was inaugurated.

Using existing ethnographic and historical sources as a starting point, we filmed interviews with modern-day tribespeople to create a multimedia record of current Sinixt perceptions of their traditional lifeway. Relating ethnographic sources to the past requires exploration of how group identity manifests in the archaeological record and the significance it holds for descendant populations. Kranzler, Brian (Museum of Northern Arizona) [20] Jewelry and Worked Stone Artifacts Along the Grand Canyon River Corridor This paper examines jewelry and worked stone artifacts from nine sites along the Colorado River corridor in Grand Canyon. Sites examined include both seasonal and long term habitation sites. Are items of personal adornment traded in or are these items of local manufacture? Does this change through time? Are there raw material sources for jewelry within the canyon? One site examined is Furnace Flats, where a high number of pendants made from green travertine were found in one room. Was this a manufacturing and distribution locus for this particular item? Krasinski, Kathryn (Fordham University) and Gary Haynes (University of Nevada, Reno) [30] Actualistic Research of Proboscidean Processing and Cutmark Production Cutmark studies have figured prominently in New World Pleistocene archeology; however, the influence of carcass processing activities, flesh availability, tool type, and raw material on cutmark attributes remains poorly understood. Before utilizing modified faunal remains as proxies for a human presence in the Americas, a thorough understanding of bone responses to cultural modification is critical. An actualistic approach was undertaken to study the effects of butchering large mammal remains including an African elephant carcass

and cattle limbs. While little intertaxonomic variation between cutmark placement was observed, cutmark morphology was complex. Simple V-shaped cutmarks are not diagnostic of stone tool use. Krasnec, Katina (University of New Mexico) and C. L. Kieffer (University of New Mexico, Maxwell Museum) [266] Determining Status in Looted and Sacrificial Contexts at Midnight Terror Cave Grave goods have been widely used to identify individuals` status. In cases of looting and sacrifice this approach is limited by the absence or reduced quantity of grave goods. In these cases, overall health, paleopathology and isotopic data can indicate the status of individuals. The application of this approach to osteological material from Midnight Terror Cave, Cayo District, Belize suggests the presence of both elite and commoner sacrificial victims. Different models will be presented to account for their presence as well as the religious and social implications. Krause, Samantha (Maya Research Program), Thomas Guderjan (University of Texas at Tyler), Sheryl Luzzadder-Beach (George Mason University) and Timothy Beach (Georgetown University) [238] Identifying the extent of ancient Maya ditched field systems in the Rio Hondo valley of Belize and Mexico. Scholars have long known that intensive agricultural systems were a component of the Classic Maya economy. Early studies identified ditched agricultural field systems and sparked debate whether they were human made distracting from the question of their extent and their role in Maya economy. Recent aerial surveys have revealed that the extent of agricultural intensification in the Rio Hondo valley was not yet well known and probably was underestimated by the archaeological community. We present new data resultant from aerial photography, mapping and GIS that will enable us to better understand the scale and nature of ancient Maya agricultural systems. Krautkramer, Jesse (Tahoe National Forest) [29] Cultural Transmission, Style, and Continuous Variation Among North Central Sierra Nevada Projectile Points Changes in the form of material culture over time and space are directly linked to changes in the context of cultural transmission. This implies change in the general social context. Continuous morphological variation in a sample of 673 projectile points from 30 sites both east and west of the Sierra crest is used to examine style in north central Sierra Nevada prehistory. Distinct trends in continuous variation are compared to archaeological contexts associated with C14 dates and obsidian hydration readings. Theories of style and cultural transmission facilitate interpretation of these patterns and provide insight into social changes and longstanding traditions.

a province in the most southwest region of China. There is incredible biological and ethnic diversity in Yunnan, which has resulted in a rich heritage of community-based fire management (CBFiM). We examine the diversity of management through three communities and their CBFiM approaches: the village of Wenyime, in Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, a village near Shangri La in Diqiang Prefecture, and Liming village in Laojunshan in Lijiang Prefecture. All three examples illustrate a recent shift in direction; a movement away from centralized and state-driven forest fire management towards decentralized and mainly community-based management regimes. Kremkau, Scott (Statistical Research, Inc.), Seetha Reddy (Statistical Research, Inc.) and Kathleen Hull (University of California at Merced) [151] Knapping through time along the coast: Lithic Technologies in the Ballona, West Los Angeles The Ballona Lagoon in west Los Angeles encompasses over 8,000 years of human occupation. Lithic collections, including more than 50,000 analyzed for this talk, are composed of primarily subsistence-related tool kits, in addition to a large, unique collection of ritual artifacts. This talk will present major technological changes in lithic artifacts over time in the Ballona, and their implications for food procurement and preparation, trade and interaction. Some of the topics discussed include role of milling equipment, introduction of the bow and arrow, variability in projectile points, site function, and food preparation and disposal behavior associated with feasting.

Recent discoveries in Tula Chico add to the corpus of relief carvings of prone figures already known from Tula Grande. All may be considered deceased ancestors on the basis of pose, costume, and architectural context. I suggest that the imagery can be considered a form of symbolic ancestral burial used for veneration, polity rituals, and the recording of political history. Kroskie, David (Indiana University of Pennsylvania) [209] The Role of Small Habitation Sites in Monongahela Subsistence-Settlement Studies centered on Monongahela village sites have contributed significantly to our understanding of Monongahela subsistence-settlement patterns. However, this understanding is limited due to a lack of attention placed on other site types. A comparative study of small habitation and village sites from the same general area and time period provides insight into the complementary role of these sites in Monongahela subsistence and settlement patterns. Specifically, the possibility that small habitation sites were special purpose sites utilized in tandem with village sites can be explored.

Krus, Anthony (Indiana University) [210] The Development of Bastions: A Morphometric Analysis of Mississippian Fortifications Palisades with bastions were first constructed in the Mississippian region (1000AD-1450AD) and were soon built throughout the Midwest and Southeast. A database of every Mississippian period palisade with bastions was compiled. Using geometric morphometrics as an analytical technique, a typology for bastions on palisades created and used to track how the architecture of these structures developed. It was found that through time bastions became smaller and shifted from closed-back structures to open-back structures. This is interpreted as the product of prehistoric technological developments to decrease how much wood and labor was spent in palisade construction. Krus, Anthony [115] see Nathan, Rebecca A.

Construction of small terraces enhanced moisture and fertility conditions by slowing and retaining transported water, organic debris and sediments. This paper presents data from recent soil and runoff collections from the Perry Mesa region of central Arizona. Soil nutrient and moisture dynamics of this runoff agricultural system will be used to discuss prehistoric agricultural potential and evaluate how management of surface runoff and the construction of terraces relate to long-term agricultural sustainability.

This presentation explores the symbolism of these enigmatic icons and suggests possible organizing principles for their use in the context of the Mesoamerican ballgame. Kuckelman, Kristin (Crow Canyon Archaeological Center) [117] Violence during the Chaco to post-Chaco Transition in the Northern San Juan Region The Chaco to post-Chaco transition was a time of marked change among Ancestral Pueblo farmers in the northern San Juan region of the US Southwest. From about A.D.1130 to 1180, severe drought stimulated and formed a backdrop for population movement, privation, and societal upheaval. Evidence of violence and other hardship evidenced on human remains from numerous sites includes antemortem and perimortem trauma. Violence is also implicated in deposits of human remains

After more than 80 years Tabun cave remains one of the key reference sequences for the Lower and Middle Paleolithic of the Levant. Assemblages termed AcheuloYabrudian or Mugharan make up a large part of the sequence at Tabun. Different investigators have placed these assemblages within either the Lower or the Middle Paleolithic. Alternative classifications of the AchuloYabrudian reflect changes in how the larger periods themselves are conceived. Choices to place the AcheuloYabrudian within either the Lower or Middle Paleolithic also have important consequences for how cultural and biological transitions in the Levant are understood. Kuijt, Ian (University of Notre Dame) and Colin Quinn (University of Michigan) [226] Body to Ashes: Social and Physical Transformations Through Cremation Cremation rituals are often conceptualized as reflecting a journey and the transformation of the body and spirit. Burning is a means of destroying, consuming, and transforming the body in a way that introduces control, allowing the living to manipulate the time and place of interactions with the dead. Drawing upon multiple case studies we consider the pathways of transformational treatments of the body, from cremation, to where the bones were cleaned and transported, and finally, the place where the remains were deposited.

[245] No pain, no gain: post-imperial violence and ethnic solidarity among the Chanka of highland Peru (AD 10001400) This paper employs a bioarchaeological perspective to investigate the ways people physically and socially interacted with one another in the wake of tumultuous socio-political and environmental changes. Here we examine how the disintegration of the Wari Empire affected hinterland Chanka communities in Andahuaylas, Peru. This research examines a large collection of human skeletal remains excavated from burial caves in order to discern how communities on the local level responded to the post-imperial milieu through changes in identity-marking practices like cranial modification, and an increase in intentional physical injuries suggestive of violence, variably directed towards specific subpopulations groups.

A few archaeologists have examined how political authority operated at smaller centers, especially those lacking epigraphic and iconographic information. Recent investigations at a mid-level elite compound ­ located at Callar Creek, in the Mopan Valley of Belize ­ have considered how individuals at such smaller centers acquired and maintained their authority.

[192] Glass Beads, Conical Lodges, and Fire Scars: Native American Occupation of the Colorado Front Range Archaeological research has furthered our understanding of recent Native American occupation (AD 1600-1870) of the grasslands, foothills, and mountains of northern Colorado. Site types include habitations, rock art panels, game drives, ritual locations, and burials. These locales are found in a variety of ecological communities, suggesting widespread cultural use of diverse habitats. Fire ecologists have also built a chronology for this same span and across ecosystems, identifying natural fire patterns as well as possible anthropogenic signatures within the regional fire history. Our presentation focuses on the methodology of our on-going research and preliminary observations in linking archaeology with fire ecology.

Recent research indicates that villages in the vicinity of Queen Creek may have also been important production locales. The timing and scale of production at Queen Creek, however, has not yet been documented. Utilizing ceramic sourcing techniques, this study confirms that production occurred in the Queen Creek area over several centuries. This production increased in the late 11th and early 12th centuries following the demise of the ballcourt system and coinciding social fragmentation across the Phoenix Basin.

[261] The distribution of residential features and changing land use in the leeward Kohala field system, Hawaii Clusters of Hawaiian residential architectural features are often interpreted as the remains of ethnohistorically defined kauhale habitation complexes. Within these residential entities separate structures were used for activities such as cooking, eating, and sleeping. An analysis of 331 residential features from upland Makiloa and Pahinahina ahupuaa suggests that not all spatial associations have short-term behavioral significance. By focusing on the morphological attributes of features as indicators of chronological and behavioral trends the spatial analysis of features informs on ecodynamic processes of long-term land use within the larger context of the development of the Leeward Kohala Field System.

Analyses of inscriptions and archaeological contexts related to the this special kind of ceramics show that production activities, although were engaged by levels of household units, were not absolutely independent to each other but rather integrated into a large social network dominated by government.

Both healed and perimortem cranial injuries are present in the remains from Cerro Oreja, providing support for arguments based on settlement survey data that the Salinar and Gallinazo Phases were marked by conflict and warfare.

Lamoureux St-Hilaire, Maxime (Trent University) [40] The Last Inhabitants of Minanha: Examining the Differential Abandonment of an Ancient Maya

Community Towards the end of the Classic Maya period, many southern lowland city-states were gradually abandoned. How did this abandonment process play itself out? What did it signify for the ancient Maya who had lived in those landscapes for centuries? This paper addresses these questions by looking at on-floor assemblages from a dozen residential groups at the ancient Maya center of Minanha. Representing contexts spanning the entire social spectrum, from commoners to royal elites, the paper explores how the "collapse" differentially affected different segments of society. It also examines the social identities of the last occupants of the Minanha community.

Ethnographic and archaeological studies indicate that the Miwok and Yokuts people along the western slope of the Sierra Nevada Range buried dogs and integrated them into a number of ceremonial contexts. There is consistency in burial position among known dog burials, but variations in grave accoutrements and evidence of perimortem trauma suggest that multiple social contexts were involved in the practice. Archaeological evidence helps to clarify the ethnographic record, but burials must contain specific attributes to support inferences about context and function, including pet burial and property destruction.

Items that were encountered include mollusc remains, lithic debitage, faunal and human remains, ceramic materials and shell mounds. The data indicate that the persons of LaFlor relied heavily on mollusc procurement, which may have tied into an economic exchange system. LaFlor was evidently a significant precolumbian settlement for both the living and the dead. Larson, Dorothy (Maxwell Museum) [264] Why Not Typology?

Coexistence of the two practices has been noted, but these observations have often been seen as an anomaly, and the discourse has tended to reproduce the idea that the practices represent fundamentally different approaches to disposal of the dead. However, deeper attention to the co-existence of cremation and inhumation at several Mesolithic and Neolithic sites in Sweden shows that they can be part of coherent mortuary programs aimed at separating flesh from bones.

Lawrence, Ken (SWCA-Texas State University) [10] A Recalibrated Geoarchaeological Framework of Texas As part of research for a master`s thesis, a recalibrated radiocarbon baseline was constructed and used to compare the depositional histories of select drainage basins as well as examine possible climatic influences on the drainages and, by extension, Texas archaeology. Specifically, this paper will discuss the results of a recent archival study of select archaeological-geoarchaeological research projects in Texas that focused on alluvial deposits of Texas river basins. The research targeted projects with chronometric data from sites with deep, intact alluvial stratigraphy, which encompassed the Late Pleistocene­Holocene. Subsequently, select radiocarbon assays from these previous investigations were compiled and recalibrated using the same calibration curve (i.e., INTCAL09). Ultimately, the uniform calibration of the radiocarbon assays provided a consistent chronological framework for all of the previous investigations that could be used to compare drainage basins, paleoenvironmental data, and cultural chronologies across Texas.

In the last decade land has become increasingly enclosed and EC initiatives have encouraged people to make agricultural choices they might not have chosen otherwise. Erosion has played an important role in shaping the contemporary ecology. Looking back at traveler`s descriptions, diaries, tax and notarial records, we glimpse the area as it was in the 17 and 1800s.Using these documents it is possible to initiate the process of re-imagining the landscape and consider the social and economic implications for the local inhabitants. [78] Discussant Leach, Melinda (University of North Dakota) [179] Technology and Mobility in the Archaic Northwestern Great Basin: a View from the High Rock Country The prehistory of Archaic peoples in the northwestern Great Basin has been characterized by long-term fluctuations in climate, technology, population, and mobility. The view from the High Rock Country of northern Washoe County, illuminates a picture of culture change. With technological, chronological, and volcanic sourcing evidence from the Massacre Lake Basin and Serendipity Shelter, a strategically-located rockshelter with abundant evidence of tool production, food preparation, and possible ritual production of rock art, I explore variation in local lithic production systems across diverse ecozones. Some critical comparisons are also drawn with studies completed in the larger northwestern Great Basin region. Leach, Peter (John Milner Associates, Inc.) [265] Prospection for Submerged Prehistoric Sites In Marine Environments: A Case Study From The Damariscotta River Estuary, Maine Marine geoarchaeological investigations in the Damariscotta River estuary identified a preserved paleosol at -12.67 meters MLW and 6300 14CyBP. A combination of subbottom profiling, side-scan sonar, marine vibracoring, and GIS revealed extensive reworking of much of the study area through tidal channel migration and current scour. The paleosol, however, was preserved through indirect bedrock armoring and biodeposition by relict oyster beds. While no cultural materials were identified, the presence of a well preserved paleosol in subbottom profiles and marine cores is an encouraging case study in prospecting methods for submerged prehistoric sites and geomorphic factors leading to site preservation.

Silbury Hill is an iconic monument within the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site, and the largest prehistoric mound in Europe. Following a collapse on the summit, an earlier tunnel into the Hill was re-opened. The ensuing excavations in 2007/8 were perhaps the last opportunity for our generation to look at the construction sequence of this monument. This paper, presented by the director of the excavations, will discuss how this work

has allowed us to rethink the Hill, suggesting that the sequence is considerably more complex ­ the mound growing organically through many small events, rather than a few grand statements. LeBlanc, Allison [202] see Bain, Allison LeBlanc, Kathleen (Simon Fraser University) [5] Gender Ceramic Ethnoarchaeology in Fiji I propose to showcase a poster related to my research on ceramic ethnoarchaeology in a traditional pottery district in Kadavu, Fiji. My research, focusing on gendered social interaction, has demonstrated that relatively homogeneous ceramic assemblages can result from patrilocal residence patterns due to pressure placed on women to conform to the village style. This pressure results from the social interaction during the production process. Despite some variation in size and shape of cooking vessels (kuro), women actively work to emulate the shape of pots that have come before them and show no desire to alter the traditional style. LeBlanc, Steven (Harvard University), Michele E. Morgan (Peabody Museum, Harvard University) and Jason H. Curtis (University of Florida) [203] Seasonal variation in maize consumption by Eastern and Western Basketmaker II populations indicated by stable isotope analysis of human hair Maize was an important dietary staple for Eastern and Western Basketmaker II populations in the southwestern United States. However, there was considerable intraannual variation in the amount of maize consumed by individuals. Human scalp hairs (n=50) from Eastern and Western Basketmaker II individuals display marked intraindividual variation in stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values. Sequential sampling along single strands of hair yielded isotopic values and variability indicating that for several months of the year wild plants and/or meat contributed importantly to Basketmaker II diet. This newly emerging technique can be usefully applied to other populations. Leckman, Phillip (Statistical Research Inc.) and Nicholas Reseburg (Statistical Research, Inc.)

located near modern day Tallahassee, FL. An excavation of Mound 3 during the late 1970s unearthed 23 burials that established ties to the Etowah site in Georgia. A GIS program was used to analyze spatial relationships among the burials. Based on the artifact assemblages and burial orientation, this preliminary research identified three distinct burial patterns. One of the burial patterns suggests a new kinship or lineage introduced to Mound 3. This research has implications on the changing relationships between kinship and ideology at Lake Jackson. Lee, Chris [153] see Morrison, Alex E. Lee, Christine (Inst. Vert. Paleontology and Paleoanthropology) [23] Preliminary analysis of human skeletal remains from a Dian culture cemetery, Yunnan Province, China The Jinlianshan site is an Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220 CE) Dian cemetery. There are few completely excavated mortuary sites from southern China. Over 400 individuals were recovered from 268 tombs. This study uses physical anthropology methodologies including paleopathology, developmental defects, and dental anthropology to determine the lifestyle, health status, and biological affinities of the cemetery sample. Preliminary findings show Jinlianshan to be closely related family members from a high percentage of shared genetic defects. Their dental health suggests a high carbohydrate (rice) and soft protein (fish) diet. One interesting finding is evidence of crush injuries possibly consistent with earthquake activity. Lee, Craig (Univ of Colorado - Boulder), Robert Kelly, Ira Matt, Rachel Reckin and Marcia Pablo [57] Alpine Snow and Ice as a Source of Archaeological and Paleoecological data in the Rocky Mountains Archaeological materials have been identified in association with relatively static snow banks, or ice patches, that attracted animals and their human predators in western North America. Ice patches exhibit little internal deformation or movement and can contain ancient ice that, unlike glaciers, is kinetically stable and preservative. Archaeological and paleobiological materials recovered in these contexts provide insight into alpine paleoecology and the use of high elevation environments by Native Americans. This presentation will review efforts to identify and survey ice patches in the Rocky Mountains and highlight a collaborative effort between university, tribal and government partners in Glacier National Park. Lee, Gyoung-Ah (University of Oregon) [35] Archaeological Perspective on Origins of Azuki Bean (Vigna angularis ssp. angularis) Azuki bean (Vigna angularis subsp. angularis), is probably domesticated in northeast Asia. Its wild counterpart, A. angluaris subsp. nipponensis is grown throughout East Asia. The earlier archaeological finds of azuki are from the Neolithic Korea (Chulmun) and Japan (Jomon). Difficulty in studying archaeological azuki lies in the preservation issue. Azuki is similar to mung bean (V. radiate), and without preservation of embryo, the two cannot be distinguished in archaeological context. This study documents the morphological characters of early azuki from the Chulmun sites, and compares them to

Jomon specimens in order to illuminate the prehistoric management of azuki there. Lee, JiHyun Rachel (University of Michigan) and Ho Pil Yun (Gyeongnam Development Institute Historical Cultural Center) [149] Social and Spatial Changes in the Early Villages of South Korea Changes in social organization from ca. 1500 to 300 B.C. can be detected through overall changes in architecture and site layout in south-central South Korea. The villages of the Mumun period saw several material changes through time, including greater reliance on agriculture and craft specialization. In addition, domestic and corporate structures were transformed, with indications of social ranking. A contextual examination of intra-site spatial relationships serves to reveal the changes of the built environment and their implications in this period of South Korea. Lee, Rachel [3] see Li, Min Lee, Sungjoo [149] Understanding Leadership Types from Burials From early intensive farming societies to early states, varying material, economic, ideological, and prestigious bases have characterized leadership power. To understand the emergence of centralized political systems of early states it would be helpful to define the nature of power that leaders of regional polities used and tried to gain strategically. Assuming that power bases that leaders in different regions and/or periods attempted to exploit were represented in burial ceremonies, I define the leadership types by comparing burials. According to the variations of their burials, it is possible to classify chiefs of prehistoric and proto-historic Northeast Asia into four types. Lee, Thomas A. [51] see Lowe, Lynneth S.

These are some of the largest prehistoric communities in Interior Western Canada and constitute a critical heritage resource for understanding past societies in this region. Many questions remain about these communities, such as precisely when they developed and were abandoned and the climate and resource conditions surrounding these changes. Research at McKay Creek begins to examine these important issues while working toward site protection and increasing awareness of the archaeological heritage along the Fraser River. Lefebvre, Karine (Univ. Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne) [58] Tarascan and Mexica: New approach on the Late Postclassic settlement pattern in the Acámbaro region (Guanajuato, Mexico).

Leftwich, Brent (URS Corporation) [57] Form Follows Function: Bedrock Mortar Morphology and Settlement in the North-Central Sierra Nevada Ubiquitous throughout the north-central Sierra Nevada, bedrock mortars are synonymous with the acorn economy of the Late Prehistoric. This research project in Eldorado National Forest along the North Fork of the Mokelumne River utilized the functional variable of mortar depth from over 300 bedrock mortar sites and juxtaposed it with elevation, site size and complexity, and dominant vegetation using quantitative methods and GIS spatial analysis. The results of this approach indicate a pattern of central place optimization, permanent settlement, and risk buffering on the regional scale, while subsistence activities at the individual site proved highly variable. [57] First Chair Leger, Jessica (Pennsylvania State University) [204] The Function of Shell Deposits in the MidContinent Middle to Late Archaic sedentary hunter-gatherers of the mid-continent are associated with shell deposits. Controversy concerning these sites involves interpretation of their function. First, were these shell deposits intentionally constructed monuments or simply debris heaps? Second, did human burials in the shell deposits constitute formal cemeteries or merely convenient burials on the landscape? A single site has been systematically examined for these issues, with results suggesting it was not an intentionally constructed monument or a formal cemetery. I examined another small site to identify the potential for developing a larger scale research project that addresses these particular issues. Lehner, Joseph (University of California - Los Angeles) [167] Innovations in technology and political economy during the Central Anatolian Iron Age This paper explores the role of long distance trade and technology in the development of early urban societies in Central Anatolia. In particular, this paper focuses on major changes in metal technology and acquisition at the urban site of Kerkenes Dag (ca. 7-6th centuries BC). Shifts in producer-consumer networks are observed to coincide with major structural changes in political organization. Organizational trajectories of resourcebased networks thus become a crucial element in understanding early urban societies. [167] First Chair Lekson, Stephen (University of Colorado) [94] The Later Prehistory of the Great Basin and the Southwest: Thinking about Fremont For decades, archaeologists have debated the origins and meanings of "Fremont," a cultural designation which includes the late agricultural societies of the eastern

Great Basin. This paper looks at Fremont in a wider geographic context, as the northern and northwestern expression of a remarkable spatial expansion of "Pueblo" in all directions. Beginning at least by AD 900 (if not earlier), groups which had previously evidenced little or no interest in things Puebloan began building stone houses, painting pottery, and relying on maize. The areas affected ranged from Las Vegas NV on the west to Las Vegas NM on the east, and from the Chihuahua desert on the south to the northernmost Colorado Plateau and the Great Basin on the north and northwest. Each of these areas (and, indeed, each district within these larger areas) undoubtedly had local, specific histories and trajectories; yet all were arcs or chords on the circumference of a penumbra around the remarkable political and economic developments of the southern Colorado Plateau from AD 500 to AD 1300. This paper looks at the larger pattern, and suggests new ways to think about Fremont. [117] Discussant Lekson, Steve [99] see Cameron, Catherine M.

Settlements with extended occupation spans covering the Classic and Postclassic eras of Mesoamerica (A.D. 200 to 1540) showed particular patterns in the employment of mineral resources during specific periods.

The broad comparative approach used to explore these issues is characteristic of Speth, as he, and those fortunate to work with him, critically evaluate the basis of the conventional view and present some alternative explanations that are consistent with the available data.

[159] Adapting to change: the Thule occupation of Inglefield Land Excavations by the Inglefield Land Archaeology Project during the IPY focused on the Thule occupation of the northwest Greenland. Here we discuss the results this work, which demonstrate a rapid occupation of the whole area during the initial Ruin Island phase, followed by a contraction, during the winter at least, to the southern part of the region, in particular Foulke Fjord. We argue that the abandonment of the northern portion of Inglefield land is related to a combination of factors including climate change related to the Little Ice Age, and later, the increased presence of over-wintering exploration parties. Lemus-Lauzon, Isabel (Université Laval), Najat Bhiry (Université Laval) and James Woollett (Université Laval) [25] Environmental changes and cultural changes in Labrador (Canada): paleoecology and traditional knowledge During the last centuries, inhabitants of northern Labrador experienced important climate and cultural changes. It seems that the cool climate of the Little Ice Age and the subsequent warming affected tree growth patterns. At the same time, the establishment of Moravian induced changes in the use of wood. The main objectives of this project are to: 1) document historical wood use in Nain, the northernmost community of Labrador, and 2) gather data on environmental changes in this region. In order to achieve these objectives, cultural geography (e.g. interviews with local elders) and paleoenvironmental methods (e.g. dendrochronology, macrofossil analysis) were used.

Utilizing historical records and statistical analysis, we investigate population shifts within the specific case studies of Inishark and Inishbofin, Co. Galway, Ireland. Current reconstructions of population dynamics are generally restricted to population shift due to famine-related deaths and massive immigration. Preliminary statistical analysis helps us reconstruct an ever-shifting population growth as a response to the socio-economic pressures created by the Famine.

Despite their inclusion in several different mortuary and architectural contexts from around the site, these vessels exhibit remarkable uniformity, and can be grouped into clusters of mold-mates based on shared attributes. Given the ephemeral nature of ceramic molds, which deteriorate over time due to constant exposure to water and other inclusions in clay, mold-mates can be used to establish temporal links among these distinct, archaeologically defined contexts.

As prehistoric sites on the Chengdu Plain and their potential relationships have raised more and more interest in recent decades, this study attempts to explore the economic connections between different settlements by modeling them as elements of social networks. The topology of the networks and the relative importance of settlements within them will be discussed. This contribution proposes that social network analysis is an efficient method in explaining and evaluating varied relationships between constituent settlements. By inspecting the establishment, collapse, and renewal of certain connections, the changing politico-economic processes and the roles of settlements can be better understood.

The excess/shortage of cortex relative to total artifact volume reflects movement of lithic materials between assemblages. This study employs experimentally produced lithic reduction sets and computer simulation to investigate the impact of various artifact removal patterns on the cortex composition of complete lithic assemblages. Results suggest non-random artifact exportation to be responsible for the underrepresented cortex ratio in the surface lithic assemblage in Western New South Wales, Australia.

recently excavated Late Archaic or pre-ceramic sites from the central to northern areas of Arizona are similar to those observed for the well defined Early Agricultural or Late Archaic of the Tucson Basin of southern Arizona. A number of these mortuary practices appear to be associated with a lifestyle that involved some degree of mobility. Aspects of mortuary behavior held in common by regional Arizona Late Archaic groups to international hunting and gathering populations are suggestive of mortuary systems based on land tenure, kinship groups and perhaps unilineal descent. Lincoln-Babb, Lorrie [52] see McClelland, John Lind, Michael (Santa Ana Unified School) [95] The Zapotec Sacred Calendar: A New Perspective. In 1578 Fray Juan de Córdova published a version of the Zapotec sacred calendar in his Arte del idioma zapoteco which has puzzled scholars for years. Recently, however, Javier Urcid (2001) has been able to identify the twenty Zapotec day names, and David Tavárez and John Justeson working with seventeenth-century calendars from the Sierra Norte have provided new insights into the nature of the Zapotec cosmos and terms associated with the Zapotec sacred calendar. The discovery of lists of the presence of the nine lords of the night in both modern (Weitlaner 1958) and seventeenth-century (van Meer 2000) versions of the Zapotec sacred calendar provides additional information. These data will be synthesized to provide a new perspective on the Zapotec sacred calendar. Lindberg, Kelly and Chantel White (Boston University) [169] Neolithic Food Practices and Experimental Grain Processing at el-Hemmeh, Jordan The origins of agricultural production in Southwest Asia transformed the Neolithic subsistence economy, as well as the daily tasks related to food procurement and processing. The charred macrobotanical remains from the PPNA site of el-Hemmeh have revealed evidence of pre-domesticated cereals modified by grain-processing activities. This paper presents the results of experiments conducted to determine the methods of barley preparation (e.g., boiling, roasting) and processing (e.g., grinding, pounding) at the site, and distinguishes evidence of processing activities from the effects of secondary and post-depositional factors. Lindeman, Michael (Desert Archaeology) [139] 2000 Years of Occupation in the Southern Tucson Basin Continual occupation of landscape localities indicates enduring ties between people and places. Such persistence suggests complex relationships between the natural and social landscape with people weighing both the environmental advantages and the social connections to place in making settlement choices. The San Xavier/Martinez Hill area of the San Xavier District of the Tohono O`odham Nation is such a persistent place with almost two millennia of occupation. Through the integration of archaeological and historical documentation, this poster presents the settlement history of this area, beginning in the first centuries A.D. and continuing to the current day, linking landscape and people.

Lindsay, Colleen (University of Illinois UrbanaChampaign) [212] From Jungle to Garden: How the classic Maya of Yalbac, Belize modified their landscape This presentation discusses tropical landscape around the medium-sized Maya center of Yalbac, Belize to analyze Classic Maya (A.D. 250-900) impacts on the natural environment. Plants specimens were collected during the summer of 2010 to assess if and how the Maya modified native plant species. Areas surveyed include Yalbac temple mounds, smaller habitation sites, nearby jungle without sites, and a modern Maya home garden. Patterning of the over 200 species collected appear to indicate plant/human interaction through the diversity and order of plant species at habitation sites. This technique could be extended to determine past plant modification in other regions. Lindsay, Ian (Purdue University) and Conner Wiktorowicz (Purdue University) [4] Magnetic Survey of Fortresses in the Late Bronze Age South Caucasus Geophysical survey is employed in archaeological survey as an efficient means for identifying buried features, from hearths to fortification walls. In the Souch Caucasus, hilltop fortresses are a defining archaeological element of the region`s Late Bronze Age (1500-1150 BC), heralding the onset of nascent settled polities in the region in contrast with the mobile pastoral tradition of the Middle Bronze Age (2400-1500 BC). An ongoing magnetic survey on the Tsaghkahovit Plain in Armenia provides data on the spatial organization of fortresses and settlements, informing our investigations on the role of forts in regional defense and political authority over agropastoral communities. Lindstrom, Katie (University of Wisconsin-Madison) [189] Pottery Preferences at Gola Dhoro (Gujarat, India) and Cultural Affiliation Strategies along the Indus Civilization Borderlands Living amidst a culturally diverse landscape on the borderlands of the Indus Civilization (2600-1900BC), residents of Gola Dhoro (Gujarat, India) became specialists in producing highly standardized Harappan style jewelry and thus became Harappan. Drawing on primary ceramic data to elucidate fluctuating and regionalized pottery preferences, this paper argues that the cultural and social reality of this small town extended beyond the abstract boundaries created by its Harappan ties. By occupying the economically powerful role of regional craft producer, Gola Dhoro residents gained the authority to reproduce their Harappan identity within the prevailing Gujarati social and material context.

The method uses measurements of the rates of water absorption into ceramics as a means of dating the amount of time lapsed since the vessel was fired. The method has the promise of affording relatively high precision dates yet requires only relatively simple measurements and instruments. Here, we present the results of our study of the potential and limitations of this method for ceramic dating. Lipo, Carl [153] see Morrison, Alex E. [207] see Breister, Anne G.

Architectural and other features of the Inca occupation are discussed as we attempt to delineate more precisely the nature and timing of the Inca "invasion." Pertinent information recently excavated at neighboring sites also sheds some light on the IncaYumbo relationship near the end--temporal as well as geographical--of the Inca Empire.

Identifying and interpreting postmortem disturbance in Mongolia. Deliberate violence to remains can be inflicted postmortem but archaeologically distinguishing the source of disturbance is hard enough while interpreting motive may be impossible. We present the results of excavation of 37 Bronze Age mounds, northern Mongolia. Based on detailed analysis of burial structure, patterns of articulation, damage to elements and movement of bones within and outside the burial space, we argue

there is evidence of human activity distinguishable from that of animals. Alternative hypotheses of disturbance incidental to robbery versus intentional post-mortem violence are evaluated in the context of the graves, the archaeological context and ethnographic studies.

This study assesses trends of human health and dietary behavior along the intensification of social status differentiation through time during Metal Age (~2000 B.C.-A.D. 500). Social stratification is often associated with differential access to dietary resources and diversified health within and among populations. Data from paleopathology and stable isotope ratio analysis on human and faunal skeletal remains are collected to test this hypothesis. Inter-regional comparisons also highlight the unique biocultural characteristics of ancient central Thailand. Livesay, Alison K. [143] see Gilman, Patricia A. Livingood, Patrick (University of Oklahoma) [53] Centering Mounds for the Red River Caddo During the late prehistoric period the Caddo built mounds just like the Mississippians to the east with whom they shared some cultural features. Some archaeologists have assumed that the Caddo used the mounds as centralized civic-ceremonial centers just like most Mississippians; literal and figurative central places. Using several lines of data this paper will argue that many of the mounds built by the Red River Caddo were not centrally located in a geographic sense and may have served much more restricted and well-defined roles.

A young William Ritchie dug into three mounds at Squawkie Hill in the 1930s and revealed Ohio Hopewell artifacts and mound construction techniques. The location of the mounds was lost over the 75 years that have lapsed since Ritchie`s excavations. This poster presents the results of the relocation of the mounds through the use of geophysical prospection. The results suggest that there were mound characteristics that went unnoticed during the 1930s excavations.

the Moche culture in the Southern Moche Region based on the author`s research at the Phase V site of Galindo, as well as recent research at other Moche sites in region. It is argued that the end of the Southern Moche should no longer be viewed as the retreat and eventual collapse as a single polity centered at the Huacas de Moche, but rather as political fragmentation and the reconstitution and then abandonment of the political ideology reflected in the corporate art style that defines the Moche culture. Lockard Reed, Angela (Grand Valley State Univ/Univ of Pittsburgh) [154] Archaeology Service-Learning: An After-School Program The professional archaeologist has a commitment to public outreach. In this paper, a service-learning program in which college students teach archaeological concepts and principles using hands-on activities at an elementary after-school program is discussed. This reciprocal partnership enhances learning opportunities for the college students and promotes civic engagement. Because archaeology is a multi-disciplinary science, the lure of the past can be used to engage students in math, science, language arts, fine arts, and critical thinking. The elementary students become not only actively interested in the past in the abstract, but also in the study and preservation of their own history. Loebel, Thomas (University of Illinois-Chicago) [120] Go.Stop.Go: Colonization of the Western Great Lakes Over the last decade, new research into the Clovis/Gainey aged archaeological record of the Western Great Lakes has resulted in the development of a robust data set allowing for the examination of early Paleoindian adaptations on a regional scale. In this paper I briefly examine the adaptive responses of Paleoindians as they coped with the dynamic nature of the Late Pleistocene environment in this recently deglaciated area.

Andrew Loendorf, Chris (Gila River Indian Community) and Barnaby Lewis (Tribal Historic Preservation Officer/ Gila River Indian Community) [52] Continuity and Change from the Prehistoric to Historic Periods along the Middle Gila River in Southern Arizona By the 18th century, the middle Gila River was one of the few southern Arizona locations where irrigation communities remained. Agriculturalists were more widely distributed during prehistory, and the relationships among prehistoric and historic indigenes have been debated for centuries. Research on the Hohokam collapse has considered socioeconomic interactions, conflict, and subsistence practices. Point data and Akimel O`odham oral traditions are ideal for assessing these issues; however, this evidence has received little attention. From the perspective of long-term adaptational processes these data suggest that while some changes occurred, substantial evidence exists for cultural continuity between the prehistoric and Historic periods.

Stone cairns were used to mark Indian trails across the North American plains. In open terrain, these trails were situated on ridges or high points of land. An Indian trail that was oriented along the top of the hogback on the Piñon Canyon Maneuver Site, Colorado is marked with stone cairns and panels of petroglyphs. Significantly, the petroglyphs are dominated by images of bear feet, ungulate tracks, turkey tracks, and human footprints. I cannot explain the emphasis on petroglyphs of tracks, but it is worth noting they are on a pedestrian trail. Loewen, Natalia (Williams College), Anne Skinner (Williams College), John Kappelman (University of Texas at Austin), Lawrence Todd (University of Texas at Austin) and Neil Tabor (Southern Methodist University) [3] Blue Highways: Dating Shinfa River sites, Ethiopia, with ESR Ethiopia has produced many significant hominin fossils, including the earliest modern H. sapiens. Investigations suggest that the Shinfa River, a Blue Nile tributary in NW Ethiopia, was a permanent source of water even in dry periods. Thus hominin occupation over a prolonged period seems probable. The 2010 excavations produced numerous stone tools and faunal remains from within sealed sites. ESR dating was conducted on mammal teeth and produced preliminary ages ranging from 45 to 71 kya. As most sites yielded only a single sample, further work will be required to ensure no reworking has occurred within the open-air settings. Lofaro, Ellen (University of Florida) and Tiffiny Tung (Vanderbilt University) [233] Mississippian Stress: A Comparative Study of Degenerative Joint Disease in Tennessee and Georgia Examining the frequency of osteoarthritis in human remains of the Arnold site near Nashville, Tennessee, illuminates the gendering of mechanical stress and physical activity of this Mississippian people (~AD 1125--1400). The 76 scorable individuals (of 204) yielded 26 males and 21 females which were in turn compared to Mississippian (AD 1200 to 1550) Upland Georgia results (Williamson 2000) of 81 males and 81 females. While the sacrum and lumbar, thoracic and cervical vertebrae were similar in degeneration across all groups, markedly significant differences exist between female knee joints, suggesting the need for further holistic investigation, perhaps of gender roles.

People were exposed to new crops, and new circumstances which led to increased wild plant use and economic marginalization. Multiple lines of evidence show how paleoethnobotany of the recent past is relevant to understanding globalization and long term food security. [140] First Chair

[98] The Power of Gender: Paired Ceramic Figures in Late Formative West Mexico Paired ceramic figures of hollow construction are some of the most notable Late Formative human imagery associated with the shaft tombs of Jalisco, Nayarit, and Colima. Commonly defined as male-female or marriage pairs these figures have been represented as actual unions between living men and women defined by biological sex. However, statistical analysis of symbols depicted on the figures signaling gender and other forms of social status and identity suggest these images represent a dynamic system of complementary and hierarchical gender relations between and within individuals possibly used to help centralize power by establishing official ideologies during elite mortuary practices.

Results have been robust and we are currently adapting this approach for use with an AI system, SIGGI-AACS, to explore how archaeologists classify use-wear and identify tools and activities in the archaeological record.

Aspects of colonial theory will be considered as supporting a notion of local influence on new ideas. Case studies from Later Bronze Age and Early Iron Age Italy will be used to provide evidence of the complex relationships between traditional Italian pottery workshops and the Greek and later Phoenician colonies that arrived during the first millennium BC. Long, Michael (University of Texas - Austin) [186] Keeping 'tabs' on the sacred and feminine at La Blanca At Middle Preclassic La Blanca, Guatemala, archaeologists have recovered a prodigious amount of hand-made, clay figurines. At La Blanca and elsewhere, these enigmatic figurines number in the thousands, and inevitably draw a variety of interpretations. Attempts at totalizing narratives of meaning, however, are often unproductive. I have analyzed a small subset of La Blanca figurines, dubbed tab` figurines, which are remarkable for their dramatized anthropomorphic features--absent faces substituted with exaggerated feminine-sexual markers. Viewed through the lens of psychoanalysis and post-structuralist critique, tab` figurines can be regarded as materializations of thought, at the boundary between unconscious and social ties. Longacre, William (University of Arizona) and Taylor Hermes (University of Arizona) [169] Ethnoarchaeology of Rice and Pottery Production among the Kalinga, Philippines More than 200 rice fields were mapped and four rice harvests were monitored during 1975-1976 in Dangtalan, Pasil, Kalinga in the Philippines. Owners were promised that these data would not be published for at least 25 years. We explore the relationship between rice production and pottery production among the Kalinga. Our hypothesis is that households with high rice production will deliberately under produce pottery, bartering for the pots needed with rice. Poorer households can obtain the rice needed to feed their families. Information on how the fields were obtained is also presented and discussed. Longstaffe, Fred [255] see Webb, Emily C.

This paper explores the relationship between domestic production of craft goods and the development of hierarchical relations at the site of Panquilma during the LIP. I will show that in Panquilma while ruling elites were in charge of the performance of rituals that included the display and offering of crafted goods. The production of these goods was not controlled by the ruling segment of the population, but was based on independent household compounds. I argue that this data is indicating that domestic economy and the reproduction of social power at the site were not unrelated but were heavily intertwined. Lopiparo, Jeanne (Rhodes College) [24] Constructing Subjects, Destroying Objects: Materiality, Social Relations, and Placemaking at Currusté, Honduras Annual and life-cycle rituals at centers in the Ulúa Valley integrated members of communities through lavish events in which objects that indexed group membership were destroyed and interred. Evidence of such events at Currusté includes material culture highlighting women`s reproductive and productive roles, from emphases on procreation, to associations with the creation of ancestors through curation and interment of human bone bundles. In this mutual constitution of subjects, objects, and places, and of the dead and the living, social identities were materialized and embedded in the built environment through performances of embodied practices that simultaneously constructed subjects by destroying objects.

The Dmanisi hominids have a surprising mosaic of primitive morphology such as small body and brain sizes and an absence of humeral torsion coupled with derived human-like body proportions and lower limb morphology. These fossils bring into question whether Homo erectus was the first.

Horizontal excavation of one select house group provides a detailed contextual sample of the earliest living arrangements. Understanding how this particular place was occupied and the degree to which this occupation could be considered "developed" or "developing" will provide a case study of the transitional processes at work throughout the Maya lowlands.

Petrography, as a materials science tool, is a powerful complement to traditional type-variety and modal ceramic analyses. By understanding the tempers selected by the Yaxuna vicinity potters, we can better understand the ideology, technology and ultimately the function of serving trade-wares like the Arena Group, a short-lived Late Classic (AD 600-700/750) ceramic group that defines the relationship between the sites of Yaxuna, Yucatan and Coba, Quintana Roo.

[177] MNI, NISP, or What? Considering Specimen Interdependence in Mortality and Size Distributions The dominant mode of quantification in zooarchaeology is NISP, which has been shown to contain much of the information of derived measures without some of their problems. But for some studies (e.g., animal size or mortality distributions), the issue of specimen interdependence creates interpretive problems, and there may be advantages to using MNI, MNE, or single portions to calculate numbers per age or size group. These may provide more conservative and defensible interpretations than NISP counts assuming specimen independence, and are explored here with fish size and pronghorn age data.

This study, by reproducing a simplified mortar production process in the laboratory environment, shows the feasibility of an innovative protocol for mortar dating. Carbon isotopes, %C, XRD and SEM analyses were performed on a series of laboratory mortars to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed methodology.

The protocol allows the suppression of the dead-carbon contamination allowing unbiased dating for the analyzed mortars. Luce, Joseph [156] see Perez, JoEllen M. Lucero, Lisa (University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign) [90] Maya Commoner Materiality in a Low-Density Urban Landscape Late Classic Period (c. A.D. 550-850) Maya farmers typically practiced an extensive mode of agriculture in hinterland or non-center areas. Further, the dispersed nature of fertile soils meant that people lived blanketed across the landscape rather than concentrated in villages. While centers acted to bring people together to promote solidarity, domestic rites focused on the family. In fact, Maya commoners left a record of these rites and their family histories in their homes via specialized deposits as I illustrate through a discussion of ceramic clusters (their color, placement, and associated artifacts) from several houses at Saturday Creek, Belize.

Maya figurines, primarily from the island of Jaina, offer investigators insights into the Late Classic Mesoamerican societies that produced them. The formal conventions of each tradition, and the use of figurines in burial offerings, suggest ways in which statuses and roles were enacted through representation, while stylistic and technical similarities suggest economic and cultural exchange between Veracruz and the northern Maya Lowlands. Lukacs, John (University of Oregon) [16] Sex differences in oral health in prehistory: An evolutionary perspective Women`s oral health is recognized to be worse than men`s. The disparity in oral health by sex in prehistory is examined in the context of evolutionary medicine. Sex differences in dental caries from global samples of prehistoric and living non-western populations are presented. Poorer oral health among women is a consistent finding of this meta-analysis. Sex differences in oral health result from women`s reproductive biology and from genetic factors. Changes in estrogen levels, food preferences and aversions, and immunosuppression during pregnancy represent evolutionary adaptations that enhance reproductive success, but contribute to worse oral health among women than men.

[148] Investigating Water Management Structures at El Zotz, Peten In 2009 and 2010 we investigated the formation and paleoecology of the Palmar Cival and an aguada in the ancient Maya city of el Zotz, Peten, Guatemala. The cival site revealed two paleosols at 55 and 70cm (dated to Cal BP 1820-1610); a midden through 170cm; then lacustrine, shoreline and peat deposits through 300cm. The Zotz aguada had 3 main zones: including a Late Classic layer underscored by a gravel and plaster lining at 105-115cm, and a flagstone, clay and ceramic floor from the Late Preclassic at 230cm. We present proxy evidence for these wetlands' formation and use. Luzzadder-Beach, Sheryl [223] see Beach, Timothy [238] see Krause, Samantha Lyle, Robin [135] see Clinton, Jennifer Lyman, R.

Mammalian faunal data from six assemblages dating between 12,100 and 10,400 cal BP in eastern Washington indicate Paleoarchaic adaptations there involved exploitation of large mammals (> 25 kg) in some loci and medium size mammals (5 to 25 kg) in others. Characterization of Paleoarchaic subsistence at individual sites must account for monitoring perspective--is the site a village, camp, resource extraction loci? Further, variability in recovery significantly influences analytical results. [126] Discussant Lyons, Natasha [159] see Dawson, Peter C.

However, sites occupied from the mid 1300s through the early 1400s in the Hohokam core and adjacent areas, such as the Tonto and Tucson basins, have yielded evidence suggesting the persistence of a minority social identity based in part on group origins in the Four Corners region. Such minority groups played roles in the Hohokam collapse, a complex process involving multiple causal factors. Lyons, Patrick [264] see Barker, Claire S.

High (5µm) resolution synchrotron-XRFmicroprobe surface and cross section DV images detected and eliminated macro-crystal interference from

tests of underlying base rock. An age calibration curve ±25%, was developed by correlation of pXRF DV analyses with cosmogenic-isotope dated fallen rock slabs. Results agree with known ages of DV on basalt, tuff and sandstone test surfaces and petroglyphs where approximate age can be inferred by glyph content and corresponding archaeological data in the Coso Range CA, Pahranagat NV and St. George UT areas.

We discuss the evidence and implications of the ca. AD 600 founding of a residential and ceremonial sector immediately west of the Copan Acropolis. Previous studies concluded that the El Bosque zone was urbanized before the northern foothills; it now appears that the opposite was the case. We consider evidence for a massive land reclamation project in El Bosque; the construction of a (contemporaneous) monumental funerary assemblage; and results of bioarchaeological, ceramic, architectural and other archaeological analyses.

Neutron activation analysis, x-ray fluorescence, proton-induced x-ray emission (PIXE) spectroscopy and 2-D elemental mapping via proton microprobe were employed to characterize base metals, impurities and surface features. Variability in quantities of Au, Ag, Cu, Pb and Sn have provided evidence for metal debasing. Elemental mapping of coin surfaces have indicated subgroup of coins as imitations minted in alternate regions. Results of these analyses have implications for the provenance and manufacture of the coins.

At 7,750 ft., the 20x14-mile Yellowstone Lake is North America`s largest high-elevation body of water. The University of Montana completed survey of the eastern 26 miles of shoreline, completing Yellowstone National Park`s goal to survey all 140 miles of the lake`s circumference. Archaeological survey and excavation results of sites around the lake indicate its variable use based on proximity to four major entry corridors (north, south, east and west). Differential use of obsidians and cherts provides insight into changing lake access routes during prehistory. MacDonald, Douglas [160] see Adams, Jacob S.

MacFarland, Kathryn (University of Arizona) [4] Religion in Iron Age Eurasia Religion in the Iron Age (ca. 1,000 ­ 100 BCE) of Eurasia (southeast Europe, Central Asia, Siberia, northern China) can best be studied when looking for large-scale ritualized (Bell 2009) behavioral patterns visible in landscape utilization and burial practices. While keeping the dynamic relationship between economic, political and religious aspects of culture in mind; recognizing religious and ritualized behaviors from archaeological evidence depends on multiple resources. Evidence offered by historical sources Herodotus and Sima Qian, ethnography and archaeology are contextualized and reviewed to establish patterned, religious usage within the Iron Age Eurasian landscape. Machado, Juliana (Museu Nacional - Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro) [124] Engendered Landscape Transformations: Women´s Social Network and the Construction of Places in the Amazon Region For riverines of Caviana Island, Brazilian Amazon, landscape is a social place. The forest is inhabited by enchanted beings and non-human mothers of places. Through selection and planting of species women transform spaces into places of people. To achieve and maintain an environment for living, they exchange plants and medicines among kins. This network reaffirms social ties of human and non-human reciprocal relations while attaches them to places, reinforcing territoriality. This data indicates the existence of plant specialists and a positive correlation of plant dispersion and group identity highlighting the importance of plant circulation and its meanings for social-cultural relations.

Inca

modifications to the built environment did not directly impinge on the main architectural features but instead were confined to vacant spaces or storerooms. Yet, the Inkas took over one of Farfan's most sacred areas-the Chimu huaca burial complex-where they built a threelevel cemetery, creating a new sacred environment for state-sponsored rituals. This paper describes the nature of these changes and the possible incorporation of the Chimu huaca. Mackey, Carol [156] see Nelson, Andrew J.

During the early Middle Preclassic period (900-600 BC), the lowland Maya site of Ceibal appears to have been centered on a very early E-group style architectural complex. During the 2011 field season, excavations were undertaken to explore the construction, use, and experience of this complex by the earliest residents of Ceibal. Macrae, Scott (Trent University) and Gyles Iannone (Trent University) [238] The Development and Maintenance of Ancient Maya Agricultural Systems: A Case Study from Minanha, Belize The identification of ancient Maya agricultural systems has greatly advanced in the last few decades. However, while the distribution of these systems has become better understood, we continue to have a limited understanding of the socio-political and socio-economic factors associated with development and maintenance of these relic systems. A decade of research at the Maya citystate of Minanha has been aimed at rectifying this situation. This paper will summarize some of the key insights from this research program. Macri, Martha (Native American Studies, UC Davis) [145] Dialectology of the Classic Maya The Maya Hieroglyphic Database was in part designed to answer questions about subtle differences in the Classic Maya texts. Scribal grapheme preferences, local graphic styles, literary genres, and dialect differences all contribute to variety in what has been mischaracterized as a homogeneous timeless script. The majority of Classic period texts include specific dates; and those on large monuments are thus associated with specific locations. This combination of temporal and spatial data provides a unique opportunity to examine variation in the language recorded in Classic Maya writing that is seldom available for early texts.

along the Río San Pedro, southwest of Chihuahua City. The most intriguing site is A15-06 (Los Pilares). Excavations at A15-06 have resulted in identification of an Archaic component radiocarbon-dated from approximately 3200 years ago, and structures dated from ca. 1900 years and ca. 1100 years. Limited excavation of the deeply buried Archaic component has not produced remains of cultivars, though the location is optimal for small-scale agriculture. The older structure is dated from maize. The younger structure offers some similarities with a pattern of Ceramic-period ranchería settlement previously recognized in central Chihuahua. MacWilliams, Arthur [199] see Hard, Robert J.

Excavated in 1996, the two vault tomb produced an unusual burial population (MNI 36) with over representation of juveniles from fetal age through adolescence. Burial practices and post depositional activities are investigated to explain the commingled nature of the deposit. Several hypotheses are offered to account for the large quantity of well preserved juvenile remains.

Magee, Peter (Department of Archaeology, Bryn Mawr College) [13] The domestication of the dromedary camel and the organization of trade in ancient southwest Asia. The domestication of the dromedary camel has traditionally been viewed as one of the cornerstones of nomadic pastoralism in Arabia. This approach encompasses a broader narrative that reduces the

inhabitants of Arabia to the passive margins of the ancient Near East. We argue that not only did the domestication of the dromedary fundamentally alter the conduct of trade, but it also contoured political relations, between Arabia and the fertile crescent between c. 1000 and 500 BCE. The inability of ancient states to engage with unfamiliar social organizations in Arabia ultimately resulted in sweeping changes to regional order throughout southwest Asia.

This synthesis brings together broad-scale archaeogeophysics, mapping, and selected excavations to provide a more holistic view of the sites presented. The geophysical data are used to interpret formation and function of these sites based on the integration of the above listed methods and evidence and serve to provide information that would be lacking in the archaeological investigations otherwise.

While these groups left their mark through various architectural and land use remains, the ceramic assemblage of the local population has remained remarkably consistent with earlier periods in contrast to the many new wares which appear on the coasts. This paper summarizes the findings of an analysis performed on the Islamic pottery collected by the Dhamar Survey Project since 1994, and investigates reasons for the strong persistence of this local ceramic tradition.

Maloof III, George (Centro de Investigación Arqueológica-PH El Diquís) [8] Classic Maya Agriculture in Joya de Cerén: Platforms, Walkways & Other Cleared Areas Classic Maya agriculture has been traditionally characterized as highly organized with significant intensification to support large populations (Abrams 1995; Sheets et al. 2007). Even in the Zapotitán Valley populations were such to require an intensive agricultural

strategy (Black 1983). Recent work at Joya de Cerén revealed evidence of this strategy; however, several of the operations lacked evidence of cultivation. This suggests first that the strategy was not geared to maximize space, indicating that production pressure was not high (Christine Dixon, personal communication, 2009) and second that processing areas for harvested manioc and maize were an important concern to these agriculturalists.

Anticipating short term climate instability during the Upper Paleolithic at Vale Boi, southwestern Portugal The Vale Boi archaeofaunal assemblage from southwestern Portugal reveals evidence of Upper Paleolithic resource intensification in the form of bonegrease rendering of ungulates and concentrated rabbit exploitation. With initial occupation at 27, 000 BP, Vale Boi represents the earliest known case of grease rendering in Eurasia. The presence of fully adult red deer and horse remains, in combination with fetal/neonate individuals, indicates a spring occupation. The timing of grease-rendering at Vale Boi was likely due to the Atlantic-influenced Mediterranean climate of the region. This timing, however, gave foragers an increased ability to anticipate and prepare for future short-term climate instability.

Intensification of resources such as salmon, roots, and local aquatic resources is often cited as the cause of declining mobility. To address this question in the middle Snake River region, I have re-analyzed fish remains from the Hetrick site (10WN469; Weiser, ID), with occupations spanning the Holocene. Expectations from foraging theory and paleoclimate data are used to address whether salmon and other fish use changed over time and if such changes are correlated with the development of the Winter Village Pattern.

Manzanilla, Linda (U Nacional Autonoma de Mexico) [116] Intermediate Elite Control Of Craft Production And Sumptuary Good Exchange In Barrio Centers At Teotihuacan (Classic Period) Teotihuacan was no doubt an exceptional metropolis in Mesoamerica during the Classic period: large planned urban settlement, a craft production center, a multiethnic city, the capital of a peculiar type of state, a sacred site, a corporate society. Two different control levels emerge from the analysis of craft production and sumptuary good exchange in the city: the co-ruling elite, involved in the control of foreign raw materials such as jadeite, mica and perhaps slate, and the intermediate elites heading barrio centers, involved in the flow of marine shells and other fauna, cotton mantas, hides, perhaps greenstones, pigments, etc. This paper will review the Teopancazco barrio center as an example of the latter, involved in the flow of goods from northern Veracruz to Teotihuacan, and their transformation into elite attires.

Exploring the Parita valley, Panama and Lurín valley, Peru If we adhere strictly to the top-down/bottom-up dichotomy in archaeology, then we tend to think of past societies in similarly rigid ways, leading us toward repetitive conclusions about systemic economic control or individual self-aggrandizers. Understanding how regional systems affected social circumstances among local populations and how local populations responded, while not a novel idea, strikes us as a particularly effective one for reaching broader conclusions about how and why societies change. We compare evidence from the Lower Lurín valley in Peru and the Río Parita valley in Panama to investigate various ways regional and local interactions affected broader social change.

Understanding post depositional site transformations allows archaeologists to evaluate the quality of the data recovered, and how to adjust both data gathering and interpretation techniques. Archaeological sites in Apalachee Bay, in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, are protected from major storms due to the nature of the continental shelf in that area.

Casts of the dentitions of prehistoric individuals were examined under a scanning electron microscope, the resulting images qualified and quantified, then measured statistically against the control group whose teeth exhibited less extreme wear. It is expected that this study will demonstrate that specific methods used in ancient basket-weaving are discernible through examination of dental microwear. This research will contribute a methodological example of the use of dental microwear in explaining aspects of ancient life other than diet. Marks, Ted [61] see Kendall, Bryan S.

This paper presents results of a 2010 survey conducted in the Northern Namib Desert in Namibia, an area containing abundant MSA and Late Stone Age (LSA) surface lithic scatters. I demonstrate that the spatial distribution of artifacts across the landscape has been relatively little disturbed since their original discard, thus providing an opportunity for comparisons between the LSA and MSA in spatial patterning of behaviors such as raw material procurement and landscape utilization.

Black Laboratory of Archaeology (GBL) at Indiana University. One hundred of these individuals were sampled for ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis, but the overall rate of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) retrieval was quite low (~5%). Infants, in particular, had the best DNA preservation of the individuals sampled, and the hypothetical bases for this result are explored.

cemetery in Northeast Arkansas. We replicated Dalton tools of Lafayette Formation (also known as Crowley`s Ridge chert) and other regionally available lithic resources. We based replications on examination of morphological and metric attributes recorded on tools from the Sloan site. We used replicated Dalton tools for a variety of tasks in order to generate a dataset that could be compared with use-wear traces recorded on Dalton points and other tools from the Sloan site.

Marshall, Fiona (Washington University) and Cheryl Asa (St. Louis Zoo) [126] African wild ass behavior, domestication, and conservation Morphological change was slow during the course of donkey domestication. This is demonstrated by donkey burials associated with an early Egyptian king at Abydos c. 3000 BC. These animals have limb-proportions of wild asses but pathologies indicative of load-carrying. Research on wild ass in zoo settings provides insights into relevant selection processes in captive settings. African wild ass are not social and do not fit expectations of a species with high domestication potential. However, this study provides insights into domestication processes showing that in captivity African wild ass are more behaviorally plastic than desert equids such as the Grevy`s zebra.

Excavations of the East Village conducted by the WPA during 1938-1941 left many unanswered questions regarding the interpretation of the area. During 2010, the northern boundary of the WPA-excavated East Village was relocated and a trench excavated to document the original profile using current excavation methods. This has generated new radiocarbon dates on the structures along the East Village`s northern boundary, and provided less ambiguous interpretations of the middens and structures Marshall, John [52] see Craig, Douglas B. Marston, John (Brown University) [111] Ratios and simple statistics in paleoethnobotanical analysis Many paleoethnobotanical analyses of macroremains begin with the calculation of a variety of simple measures, including seed density, ubiquity, diversity indices, and ratios. These methods are often used as preliminary mechanisms for data exploration but also can be the focus of analysis for a given set of samples. This paper reviews contemporary use of these simple measures as methods for both data exploration and hypothesis testing, with an emphasis on the use of ratios as a mechanism for testing hypotheses at both the intraand intersite level.

Taphonomic study of the remains of those who died in warfare events reveals weathering, carnivore damage, and nonformal disposition of remains as well as evidence of trophy-taking and anthropophagy. Thoughtful analysis and interpretation of the taphonomic evidence has led to a richer and more nuanced understanding of Ancestral Pueblo warfare events and the societal contexts in which they occurred.

Green obsidian was an offering and was used as part of the cremation process. Six green obsidian spear-points recovered show extreme temperatures (>1000ºC) were reached during the cremation. Points have crazing and five are bent due to high temperatures. Deformation is distal suggesting points were hafted and bending occurred due to being thrust into burning items within the cremation- thus providing clues about the experiences of those participating in a funerary event.

The recently excavated site Paso Otero 4 (Pampean Region, Argentina) has yielded significant archaeological and paleoenvironmental information for the region. A remarkable feature of the site is a circular U-shaped hole of ca. 1.4 m depth assigned to the early Holocene (ca. 8700-8000 years BP). The aim of this paper is to discuss the probably functional assignment of this trait to a water well through the use of different lines of inquiry such us radiocarbon dating, sediment textures, pollen, diatoms, and silicobioliths analyses. Paleonvironmental proxy indicates that it would have been dug during a period where arid conditions prevailed.

Practices essential to the stability and authority of governing nobles and priests was founded in dependency on home production of its residents. Faunal distribution illustrates that white-tailed deer and wild turkey husbandry provided staple commoner foods and deer was a key export commodity in regional markets.

Following Bell`s (1992) notion of ritualization, ritual does not passively mirror the social, it creates it. This approach is applied to the landscape of Rocky Point on southern Vancouver Island, one of the largest recorded funerary complexes on the Northwest Coast. This paper explores these cemeteries within a framework of ritual practice and discusses the implications for strategies of differentiation through degrees of formalization in feature construction and use of space within and between these cemeteries.

This development marked a sharp departure from the geometric imagery that characterized earlier kiva paintings. Scholars contend that these changes signaled the onset of modern Puebloan worldview. A study of contemporary Puebloan ethnography, along with a discussion on the nature of religious beliefs among the Casas Grandes (AD 1200-1425) culture, is helpful in interpreting Pueblo IV kiva mural scenes at Pottery Mound, New Mexico.

Associated ceramics indicate late Pueblo II occupations; Et Al also has a PIII component. The Great House architecture points strongly to Chacoan influences and specialized features are present. Kayenta tradition types dominate or contribute strongly to the late PII painted pottery assemblages, raising questions: Were these sites established by Kayenta colonists or is the pottery being traded in from south of the San Juan? Problems exist with both explanations.

Our excavations have yielded a different picture. Near the Huaca Loro mound we found metal workshops, areas of large-scale food preparation and consumption, and evidence of ritual activities, suggesting that the Plaza were used intensively for elite funerary preparations, celebrations of buried ancestors, and architectural renovations. We discuss implications of these findings in regard to our current notions of the plaza and funerary analysis on the north coast.

One hundred fifty rock art panels in the Flagstaff area, consisting mostly of petroglyphs, were analyzed for a variety of variables including motif frequency, distance from habitation sites and washes, and directionality. The distribution of frequently-occurring motifs, such as bear paws, lizard men, snakes, and spirals was analyzed to evaluate the possibility that some of these may have functioned as clan symbols. Maxwell, David (Simon Fraser University) [34] Marine Invertebrates from Caches and Problematical Deposits at Tikal, Guatemala Caches and problematical deposits in the Tikal North Acropolis have yielded a wide variety of marine invertebrate remains, including a wide variety of bivalves and gastropods, along with sea urchins, sponges, and other materials.

May, Elizabeth (University of Arizona) [99] Current Research into Sinagua Communities in the Verde Valley, Arizona Jeff Dean`s legacy is one of attention both to the scale of human-environmental interaction and the scale at which we ask questions about these interactions. Current research into settlement dynamics within the Verde Valley seeks to investigate the severity and timing of arsenic poisoning on Puebloan communities who occupied the valley in the 12th through 14th centuries. Using a multidisciplinary approach combining dendrochemistry, dendrochronology and a landscapescale study area, this study is shaped by Jeff Dean`s emphasis on paleoenvironment and his methodology of investigating multiscalar interactions while keeping human behavior in the fore.

They have provided forensic assistance to investigators and attorneys in a number of areas including: archaeological crime scene investigation; archaeological damage assessment; search warrant affidavit preparation; service of search warrants; grand jury testimony; participation in preliminary hearings and other pretrial procedures; and expert witness testimony in trials, civil hearings, and sentencing hearings. This is an important component of forensic archaeology and one that helps to protect and preserve archaeological resources. McAnany, Patricia (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) [197] Reflecting on Activism and Indigenous Maya Heritage Alienation Engaged scholarship balances research with usefulness and benefits to involved communities and seeks to create a new model in which communities play an active voice in the construction of knowledge. Within archaeology, this dynamic is complicated by the addition of placefocused heritage. This friction-prone triad is examined in reference to the Maya region where centuries of heritage alienation have engendered an ambivalent relationship between indigenous peoples and their past. The inaccessibility of archaeologically constructed knowledge of pre-Hispanic places to local Maya communities highlights this alienation. This paper reflects on the ethical responsibility of archaeologists to deliver educational information (packaged within a specific logic) to local communities and whether, in the long run, such programs can empower--economically and politically-- indigenous peoples and effect social justice.

Unfortunately, in Pacific Nicaragua cemeteries are also the principal targets of illegal looting, so relatively few scientific excavations have been conducted. This paper will summarize research on mortuary practices from the recently excavated sites of El Rayo, Tepetate and Santa Isabel. There is substantial variation among sites in the age, sex and health profiles of interred individuals. Furthermore, contextual variation indicates diverse mortuary practices between contemporary sites. These elements are explored in relation to differences in site function and regional as well as temporal differences.

This paper explores the technological consequences of this transition with lithic data from the gravel plains of the central Namib Desert, Namibia. The paper examines diachronic trends in knapping strategies, patterns of raw material use, tool retouch and use-wear.

[52] Assessing Bioarchaeological Evidence for a Demographic Collapse in the Lower Salt River Basin It has almost become an axiom that Hohokam people living in the lower Salt River Basin suffered poor and declining health during the Classic Period. In this paper, we review bioarchaeological data obtained during the late 1980s and 1990s from the lower Salt River and Tonto Basins. The emerging pattern does not support the hypothesis that people of the lower Salt River Basin were exceptionally stressed in comparison with their contemporaries who lived elsewhere. There are also some indications from more recent work that the case for a health and demographic crisis in the Phoenix Basin may have been overstated. McClung De Tapia, Emily (UNAM Mexico) and Carmen Cristina Adriano-Morán (UNAM Mexico) [25] Evidence for management practices in wood charcoal remains from the Teotihuacan Valley, Mexico

Several studies propose preferential use for fuel of wood taxa from primary vegetation, until such resources face depletion, at which time taxa from secondary vegetation together with other alternative resources are incorporated. However, the constant presence through time of secondary taxa among charcoal specimens recovered from prehispanic archaeological contexts in the Teotihuacan Valley, Mexico, indicates continual use of several types of wood as fuel, from the Formative through the Late Postclassic period in the region. The exploitation of secondary taxa is believed to represent a management strategy practiced by the region`s inhabitants rather than the shortage of suitable wood resources. McClure, Richard (U.S. Forest Service) [160] Elk Pass Obsidian and Precontact Band Territory in the Southern Washington Cascades At the landscape level, the embedded procurement strategies of hunter-gatherer-foragers may produce archaeological distributions of toolstone material that reflect the home ranges or territories of a specific group or band. The distribution pattern of Elk Pass obsidian within the southern Washington Cascade Range provides an example from the southwest Plateau region. Located in an alpine setting at the crest of the Cascades, the geochemical source is a toolstone quarry (45LE286) used as early as 6500 B.P. Distance-decay curves for formed tools and lithic debitage demonstrate the limited distribution of Elk Pass obsidian, with little to no evidence for exchange. The archaeological distribution for the material is limited to a radius of 52 km, and confined entirely to the upper Cowlitz River basin. Mechanical properties or quality of the toolstone may be a factor limiting distribution. The pattern of distribution suggests toolstone use was restricted to a specific band or small group of related bands with direct access to the Elk Pass quarry.

These discoveries support a hypothesis that ecological constraints for cattle around watering sites provided an important impetus settlement during the Middle Holocene recession of the Southwest Asian monsoons.

In Hawaii, breaking customary rights and obligations under the kapu system was punishable by death. But, we know remarkably little about how territoriality operated in practice. To begin to address this, we present the results of sourcing over 1,000 volcanic glass artifacts from across Hawaii using EDXRF. This database gives us an unprecedented look at interaction spheres within the Hawaiian Islands created by regular social networks of trade, exchange, and access to natural resources on the community, district, and inter-island scales.

Battle Mountain Pasture is located on a broad valley at the confluence of the Humboldt River, Reese River, and Rock Creek. This otherwise flat alluvial plain is punctuated by a series of well-dated abandoned meander belts and terraces that comprise a series of Middle and Late Holocene landscape features. Using these features as a basis for an archaeological sample design, a total of 9,158 acres were systematically surveyed resulting in the documentation of 230 sites.

McKenna, Peter (BIA SWRegion) and Thomas Windes (UNM) [99] Early Navajo Occupation in East Chaco Canyon, New Mexico In recent decades the heartland of the Dinetah Navajo has been intensively studied. Results of new tree-ring dates provide a firm temporal footing for the identity of early Navajo occupation in the Chaco area. We examine six Dinetah-era Navajo sites in eastern Chaco Canyon and believe that these, and other Chacra Mesa sites, represent some part of the greater Dinetah settlement. We offer suggestions as to why Chaco failed to become as intensively settled as the Dinetah heartland 20 miles to the north. McKenna, Peter [99] see Windes, Thomas C.

McHone, Elizabeth (Ripon College) [35] Paleoethnobotany at Cerro Trapiche, Moquegua, Peru Results of a paleoethnobotanical analysis will be presented, showing the relative importance of local agriculture versus collecting of plants from the local environment. An emphasis on maize and other domesticates shows that the Cerro Trapiche were either integrated into an agricultural system or were trading/relying on agricultural products for the majority of their diet. Comparisons across time and space will be shown using several different statistics of ubiquity and diversity.

These are largely inferred based on flake size and flake type. Experience with flint knapping, however, can impact the quality and uniformity of flakes as well as the frequency of angular shatter produced, and although this is assumed, it has rarely been quantitatively tested. This study demonstrates definitively that as a knapper gains experience, the flakes produced become more

During the British military`s occupation (1690-1853) of Brimstone Hill Fortress on St. Kitts in the West Indies, thousands of enlisted men served at the Fortress with many dying on the island. Excavations at Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park have revealed the presence of two distinct burial areas containing the unmarked interments of British soldiers and possible family members close to a marked cemetery. This bioarchaeological study of these enlisted personnel uses skeletal evidence, archaeological context and historical documentation to explore the lives and deaths of the common soldier serving in the British military in the West Indies.

We discuss new fieldwork investigating the Paynes Creek salt industry, including its submergence by sea-level rise and the wooden structures preserved in a peat bog below the seafloor. Previous research by McKillop and LSU students mapped 4000 wooden posts defining buildings, as well as briquetage--pottery from boiling brine to produce salt. Ongoing fieldwork includes remote sensing in an automated vessel designed for shallow water, integration of imagery into our UnderwaterMaya GIS, sediment coring, and excavation. McLeester, Madeleine [124] The Archaeology of an Industrialized Environment: Tackling the Environmental Archaeology of the Hidden, Obscured, and Erased Past of the Calumet Region The Calumet Region seems ill suited for an environmentally centered archaeological investigation. It is covered by over 60 square miles of slag, Superfund sites, and toxic soils. All of these things make this place seemingly unenvironmental and unarchaeological. However, my research argues that the archaeology of this region is essential precisely because of these factors. Industrialization, its decline, and exit from the region have erased the preceding record of human impact on the environment. Through the lens of the changing political ecology of this region, this paper investigates the physical and discursive erasure of the Calumet Region's past.

Digital models of the ceramics were created using a Konica-Minolta Vivid 9i laser digitizer. These data were then processed and the digital models used to examine vessel form, surface treatment, and stylistic design. The ceramic artifacts are being analyzed to quantify the degree of homogeneity or heterogeneity of vessel symmetry and design elements to describe the intensity of interaction between the four sites.

Galway, we explore the connection between residential histories, the changing tempos of use of individual buildings, and the lifeways of the former residents. We develop a multi-faceted understanding of island fluidity through the incorporation of archaeological survey results and historical records such as land valuation documents (1856-1941), census information (1901 and 1911), and immigration manifests. This study illustrates the necessity of developing personalized microhistorical models to understand village lifeways and preserving the cultural heritage of this coastal 19th/20th century fishing village.

Some deposits are specialised communal mounds that contain the remains of 1000s of dugongs while much more numerous, complementary shell midden mounds point more to family-based depositional practices. I argue that both types of mounds accumulated in tandem and represented the ritualised deposition of highly socialised food remains associated with community (bone mounds) and family (shell mounds) definition and solidarity. The maintenance of the biographical history of food remains through ritual deposition in curated mounds suggests absence of a concept of rubbish. McOmish, David [153] see Bowden, Mark C.

At the heart of Barbudan identity is a negotiation of boundaries between past and present while creating ways to develop their country and economy in a sustainable manner, while yet mediating public presentations and negotiations with Antigua and the larger world. Working with various international groups, Barbudans are actively reifying, mediating, and changing their cultural, geo-political, environmental, and technological borders through the control of land use, education, and development. Medeiros, Melanie [179] see Gabler, Brandon M. Mehrer, Mark (Northern Illinois University) [258] Mississippian and Chinese Neolithic Fortified Villages Fortified villages take their places in the trajectories of cultural change in both the Neolithic of China and in the Mississippian of North America. Despite some similarities in forms and functions, the defensive perimeters take on a variety of expressions depending on that which is being defended against and on other needs of the communities. A simple military defense often seems to be the determining factor, but in other cases the functions are not so easily interpreted. Examples from eastern China are compared and contrasted with Mississippian cases from the southeastern United States. Meierhoff, James (University of Illinois at Chicago) and Mark Golitko (Field Museum of Natural History) [193] Obsidian acquisition, trade, and regional interaction at the ancient Maya farming village of Chan, Belize. This paper looks at the acquisition patterns of obsidian from the ancient Maya village of Chan, Belize, and how these patterns of long distance exchange are placed in a regional and greater Mesoamerican perspective. The extreme longevity of settlement at Chan (roughly 800 B.C.-1200 A.D.), in contrast to the rapid florescence and decline of other larger sites in the Belize River Valley, in conjunction with p-XRF`s ability to accurately source a 100% sample of Chan`s assemblage (N=742), allows us to examine how external socio-political changes influenced the maintenance of exchange networks that Meignen, Liliane [17] see Rendu, William Melgar, Emiliano (Posgrado UNAM), Emiliano Gallaga (INAH-CHIAPAS) and Reyna Solis (INAH) [41] Manufacturing Techniques of Pyrite Inlays in Mesoamerica In different sites of Mesoamerica the archaeologists have found several pyrite inlays assembled in mosaic mirrors. Unfortunately, the study of these objects is focused principally on their symbolic meaning and properties, but the analysis of their manufacturing techniques and the organization of their production is scarce. In this paper, we will present the technological analysis of the manufacturing traces that we applied on different pyrite inlays, using Experimental Archaeology and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). This methodology allowed us to identify the lithic tools employed in their production with great accuracy and distinguish different technological styles.

Significantly, historical archaeology continues to advance the frontiers of this science of socially-defined spatial relationships. Recent text-based archaeologies in the Spanish colonial missions and presidios of California have produced exciting new revelations regarding the built environment. The product of Iberian, Mediterranean, Islamic, Mexican and American Indian traditions, California provides a unique cultural context within which to test the emergence of architectonic relationships and hybrid models for the built environments of the American west. This paper reviews findings from four California missions and the Presidio of Monterey.

Results are presented from recent pXRF neutron activation analysis of colonoware samples from archaeological context from Nevis, once a critical node of the West Indies slave trade. Trace element readings are compared with prehistoric Carib wares from the same island, along with modern ceramics produced by traditional potters. Findings point to common sources in manufacture and traditions, while ethnoarchaeological study suggests social meanings in the use of traditional pottery among the local population is in transition [142] First Chair Menzies, Adam (University of Pittsburgh) [93] The mechanics of chiefly cycling episodes in the Central Region of Panama and the Western Venezuelan Llanos A basic observation of chiefdoms is that they undergo episodes of expansion and contraction of political centralization. These episodes are generally referred to as chiefly cycling. These episodes of cycling often result in settlement and demographic shifts, changes in social organization and disruptions in economic spheres. This paper compares chiefly cycling in the Central Region of Panama and the Western llanos of Venezuela in an attempt to examine what factors contributed to political instability and the dissolution of chiefly polities. In

particular, the sites of El Hatillo, El Gaván and El Cedral are examined. Merchant, Peter (University of British Columbia) and Kenzie Jessome (University of British Columbia) [96] Intensive Slate Processing at Ts`unay (Deserted Bay): Evidence for change in land and resource use Ethnographic evidence indicates that Ts`unay (site EaRw-3) located on British Columbia`s south coast was a significant salmon run and an important socio-economic site for the shíshálh Nation. The importance of slate in processing fish has been ubiquitously reported throughout shíshálh territory. An examination of a recently recovered lithic assemblage composed almost entirely of slate corroborates that intensive fish processing occurred at Ts`unay. The preliminary results of our research indicate that utilization of slate occurred more intensely during certain phases that are readily identifiable from a quantitative perspective and potentially correspond with significant changes in land and resource use.

The purpose was to examine the effectiveness of LA-ICP-MS for determining chemical groups in early copper-based metalwork, in efforts to identify changing patterns in the circulation of these metals and for use in source analysis. Problems addressed include allied use of SEM-EDS for identification of major elements, the effectiveness of LAICP-MS as compared to OES, XRF, and INAA, and the quality of results achieved using different copper standards.

Mergen, Vanchigdash [236] see Eng, Jacqueline T. Merrell, Carolynne (Archaeographics) [158] Fleshing out the Idaho archaeological record through contributions from Rock Art investigations The last two decades have seen tremendous technological advancements in rock art research. The result is its greater inclusion into individual site investigations where rock art is one component as well as recognition of rock art as a viable contributor to the greater archaeology record. Recent research of pictographs and petroglyphs in Idaho offers several examples of how this information is helping answer questions regarding the culture patterns of the prehistoric peoples who first inhabited the state as early as 11,000 years ago. Rock art from selected Idaho locations will be discussed as a significant artifact to be included in the total archaeological site evaluation.

To evaluate this proposition, I will examine changes in the style and morphology of giant keyhole limpet (Megathura crenulata) shell artifacts from burials in two Chumash residential sites (CA-SBa-81, occupied from 200 B.C. to A.D. 200) and CA-SBa-72 south, inhabited from A.D. 1050 to 1250) in the Santa Barbara Channel region of southern California.

Research questions asked by archaeoastronomers differ from questions asked by other sciences and the evidence supporting conclusions are often incomprehensible to the professionals from other fields. Project Archaeology has created and tested archaeoastronomy education materials in an effort to dispel misconceptions about archaeoastronomy and share the fun of exploring the ongoing relationship between land, people, and sky with our youth. This archaeoastronomy curriculum for the professional development of elementary teachers will be presented with a discussion of the pedagogical results of offering this training online. Meshveliani, Tengiz (The National Museum of Georgia) and Zinovi Matskevich (The Harvard University) [114] The Neolithic transition in the south-western Caucasus The beginning of the agricultural way of life in the southeastern Caucasus is firmly dated to the late seventh early sixth millennium cal. BC. However, the situation in western Georgia is far from being that clear. Several known sites identified as "Neolithic", did not produce any clear evidence for domestication and sedentism. New

research, recently conducted on both open-air sites and caves, sheds new light on the Neolithic transition in the area and enables to characterize it as a prolonged process related to continuous interaction between local hunter-gatherers and the agricultural populations located farther east. Messer, Andrea (Penn State) [244] Population Pressure and Small Ancestral Pueblo Sites in the Mesa Verde Region How are small sites distributed on the landscape and what are the factors that influence this placement? Is there more of a sociopolitical component or do the environmental concerns override all else? An analysis of four full coverage surveys considering population, landform, elevation, temperature, precipitation and the location of large sites, found that the most significant variable is the number of sites at any specific time. Population pressure influences site location more than the appearance of large aggregated sites and more than the effect of changing temperature and precipitation. [251] Discussant Messner, Timothy (Smithsonian NMNH) and Gary Stinchcomb (Baylor University) [111] Land-use, climate change and C3-dominated environments: furthering the intersection of paleoethnobotanical and geological analyses Land-use practices alter environments in unforeseen ways. Climate further exacerbates these impacts by forcing people to intensify production, which contributes to sedimentation and potentially diminishes returns. Understanding the relationship between prehistoric subsistence strategies and the environment however, requires the ability to detect: mode of production, paleoclimatic shifts, and the environmental and cultural effects of these processes. In this paper we demonstrate insights afforded through integrating multiple lines of archaeobotanical inquiry with phytoliths, soil organic carbon isotope analyses and pedology. Through these analytical techniques, archaeologists can better grasp the interplay between people, food-production and climate in C3-dominated environments. Metcalfe, Duncan (University of Utah) [91] Time in Range Creek Range Creek Canyon contains a wide variety of archaeological sites in diverse topographic locations. Intuition suggests multiple settlement patterns account for this variation and, for the ecologically-oriented, that these settlement patterns likely reflect changing climatic and/or social factors. The two dozen calibrated radiocarbon dates from the canyon suggest otherwise. The majority of dates are statistically identical. Review of the radiocarbon calibration curve indicates that secular variation in the production of 14C is an important constraint on the precision of the dates. The implications for unraveling the remarkable archaeological record of Range Creek are reviewed.

a long record of human occupation that is linked and intertwined with its geomorphic history. Recent geoarchaeological studies document the nature, timing, and extent of landscape changes along different parts of the river, and the discovery of buried sites. These studies show landscape evolution was driven by large-scale climatic shifts, expressed as cycles of landform stability and instability, which occurred repeatedly and often synchronously throughout the region. Though portions have remained relatively stable, much of the landscape has changed dramatically since prehistoric people first arrived and settled along the Sacramento.

Unfortunately, in the past the public school curriculum did not address the nature of archaeological research in a realistic manner. In Jefferson City, Missouri, the public school system provides an advanced education program: Explore, Enrich, Research (EER). In conjunction with the Missouri Army National Guard, the EER program has brought archaeology into the classroom.

Meyers, Maureen (University of Kentucky) [240] Trade and Power Across Households at a Mississippian Frontier Studying the Mississippian frontier allows archaeologists to better understand the emergence and maintenance of power within Southeastern chiefdoms. Various Mississippian frontiers were pertinent in the obtainment of trade goods, important symbols of chiefly power. This paper explores the role of one frontier site, Carter Robinson (44LE10) in southwestern Virginia, in the accumulation of Southern Appalachian chiefly power through its control of trade at the border. Settlement patterns both within the site and the region are used in conjunction with utilitarian (ceramic) and non-utilitarian markers (shell and cannel coal beads) of trade to identify changes at the frontier site over time. [215] Discussant Michael, Amy (Michigan State University) and Gabriel Wrobel (University of Mississippi) [56] Dental Histology and Comparative Health in Rockshelter Mortuary Contexts A dental histological analysis of multiple individuals from two rockshelters in Belize is presented. The primary research focus was to determine if there was a microscopic component that co-occurred with macroscopic markers of nutritional stress on the teeth. Microscopic markers are likely results of acute, severe stress events, while macroscopic markers signal chronic, low intensity stress events. Individuals interred in rock shelters may be non-elites, thus exhibiting poorer health. The purpose of this study is to determine health profiles of individuals buried in rockshelters and to compare these data with health profiles generated from individuals buried in cave contexts.

Michelet, Dominique and Gregory Pereira (CNRS, France) [58] Reflections on the Antecedents and Genesis of Urban Sites in the Zacapu Malpais The Middle-Late Postclassic Zacapu Malpais was covered by settlements, whose characteristics clearly qualify as urban. The general conditions associated with the appearance of these settlements, that have no clear local antecedents, include the retraction of the traditional Mesoamerican territory, the establishment of the Tarascan state, and regional conflicts. Recent research in the Bajío, some 40 km to the north, demonstrates significant Epiclassic settlement aggregations that could somehow prefigure Postclassic urbanism. From a diachronic perspective, we compare and contrast these two models of aggregation. We also explore social and political factors in the genesis of these urban phenomena. Miles, Wesley D. [223] see Purdue, Louise E. Milic, Marina [97] Into the great wide open: Exploration of Carpathian obsidian distribution in prehistory This review focuses upon the Carpathian obsidian sources in Hungary and Slovakia, detailing the nature of the deposits (small nodules in volcanic topsoils, unlike the major outcrops of Mediterranean and Anatolia) and their use from the Middle Palaeolithic onwards, by populations throughout central Europe and the Balkans, as attested archaeometrically since the 1960`s. It then critically reflects upon the experience of non-maritime procurement, considering the necessary familiarity of landscape and river 'behaviour', together with the sensorial and practical realities of past journeys, as a means of better understanding the rationales that lay behind the "dots" on our modern distribution maps.

The context and nature of these sacrificed offerings suggest that they were part of a propitiating ritual which set this room apart from other spaces within this civic complex. Similar cases of material offerings from neighboring valleys and from more distant regions will be examined to shed light on this form of ritual practice. [35] see Szpak, Paul Miller, Alexandra E.

[54] Comparative analyses of hinterland communities: a multi-scalar investigation of Iron Age political networks in Eastern Inner Asia This paper examines the diverse ways in which hinterland communities were integrated into larger political networks. Preliminary survey data of two neighboring valleys in western Mongolia reveal changes in mortuary architecture, site size and site density. These changes suggest divergent developments from similar patterns in the Bronze Age to increased diversity during the Iron Age. Comparative analyses of these developments illustrate how independent communities are differentially integrated into hierarchical networks at the local, regional, and macro-regional levels. Multiscalar investigations thus reveal the potential complex nature of political networks. Miller, D. Shane (University of Arizona) [155] Rivers, Rocks and Eco-Tones: Modeling Clovis Landscape-Use in the Southeastern United States Using data from the Paleoindian Database of the Americas (PIDBA), I use an approach derived from complex systems theory to examine the distribution of Clovis bifaces in the southeastern United States. In particular, I find counties with the highest density of bifaces are near the intersection of major rivers, physiographic boundaries and lithic raw material sources. These represent static, highly accessible locations which are consistent with areas used by ethnographic huntergatherers for aggregation loci in boreal and temperate contexts. Finally, I discuss ways in which simple decisions by hunter-gatherers can lead to complex, nonlinear spatial patterns in the archaeological record. Miller, D. Shane [155] see Anderson, Derek T.

The shorelines of Currituck Sound are subject to various site formation processes leading to the discovery of prehistoric artifacts and skeletal material. The difficulties associated with shoreline erosion will be examined while improving the methodology of these emergency excavations. The salvage aspect of these excavations, the rapid deterioration of skeletal material in an exposed environment, and remaining culturally sensitive in a region without federally recognized Native Americans are just a few of the issues that will be addressed.

Miller, Heather (University of Toronto) [198] Surplus in the Indus Civilization: Cultural Economies and Political Traditions The Indus offers potentially intriguing answers to questions about the role of surplus in social and political structure, given its long-term status as the state that doesn`t fit the models. Following Fred Asher`s suggestion that I consider political traditions and cultural economies instead of the usual pairing of these terms, I discuss how agricultural surplus and trade/craft surplus might have been employed in Indus society and politics, and what archaeological data might be helpful.

It is difficult to model the likelihood of prehistoric archaeological sites using geographical proxy predictor variables due to the complexity of prehistoric settlement choices. In many cases classic statistical models require too much data to be useful and rely on linear relationships that may not exist. This paper reports on a preliminary predictive model for portion of a Kentucky that combines GIS analysis and fuzzy logic modeling to capture expert archaeological knowledge and to convert it into a predictive surface. Mink, Philip [199] see Sullivan, Alan P. Minnis, Paul (University of Oklahoma) [199] Exploring the Political Context of Ancient Agriculture in the U.S. Southwest/Northern Mexico While ethnographic descriptions of indigenous farming have been exceptionally useful for understanding the area's prehispanic past, this record is not adequate for modeling the socio-political context of agriculture. Understanding this context is as analytically important as understanding environmental factors. The political setting provides a framework for agricultural decision-making, including the types of crops grown and farming intensity, among other considerations. [223] see Homburg, Jeffrey A.

Analyses of excavated and surface-collected artifacts indicate that the site`s occupants were producing multidirectional cores and late-stage bifaces, as well as smaller preforms or finished tools. A distinctive feature of the workshop is the presence of numerous artifacts -- cores, tools, and debitage--made from exotic materials, including obsidian, high-quality orthoquartzites, and cherts from distant sources. Stratigraphic and other data suggest that the principal occupation of the site dates to the middle Holocene.

This Middle Monongahela phase encompasses sites geographically situated at the northern margin of southwestern Pennsylvania and characterized in part by the presence of Monongahela shell-tempered ceramics mixed with McFate Incised pottery. New investigations at the Johnston site by Indiana University of Pennsylvania archaeologists have provided additional ceramic data and an opportunity to examine important typological and functional questions concerning Monongahela people`s manufacture and use of ceramics.

Archaeologists presume that elite spaces supported both public and private activities; however we rarely find direct artifactual evidence of those activities. In part, this is due to the fastidiousness with which Maya peoples cleaned their built spaces. Nevertheless, we propose that very small items may remain in situ. Conventional archaeological collection procedures discard this material. This paper reports on our use of bulk soil sampling to capture microartifactual indices of activity associated with two elite complexes at the site of Actuncan, Belize.

This project examined the efficacy of archaeology instruction for teaching fifth grade students the elements of science inquiry including observation, inference, classification, the use of evidence, and the role of context in the interpretation of the archaeological record. Results show that students achieved basic understanding of both archaeological and science inquiry. Misunderstandings and misconceptions provided significant insights into student learning processes and point to instructional interventions to improve conceptual understanding of science inquiry. Using these results, archaeology educators can design more effective learning materials. [268] Discussant Moe, Jeanne [113] see King, Robert E. [113] see Fisher, Jack [113] see Alegria, Crystal B.

The goal of this research was to understand the timing of fan development and how these deposits integrate with alluvial and fluvial landform of the Mississippi channel to better identify the taphonomy of archaeological sites buried along the valley margins. Small and large side-valley alluvial and colluvial fans were identified between La Crosse and Prairie du Chein, Wisconsin, and sampled using coring techniques. The results reveal a simpler depositional system than previously recognized. Monaghan, John (University of Illinois at Chicago) [24] "We have, señor Viceroy, a most beautiful church:" The Creation of a Balkanized Political Landscape in Central Mexico Observers have long lamented the fractured political terrain of rural central Mexico. Oaxaca, for example, has about 4% of the country`s population but almost 25% of its municipalities. Yet the fissioning that occurred in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries was predated by a construction boom. Churches, parish houses, cemeteries, and, later on, schools and communal buildings appeared where none existed before. These efforts were often understood by outsiders as expressions of faith or a desire for progress. What this paper suggests that insiders viewed the construction, and occasional destruction, of these buildings as contentious social and political claims.

Implications of the new chronology on our understanding of culture change throughout the Lower/Middle Paleolithic The paradigms and research traditions which guided the development of Paleolithic systematics have shaped our current research questions and approaches. In particular, the notion of continual technological progress emphasized the orderly, unilineal evolution of tools towards perfection. This impacted early 20th c.

[60] No Other: Speleothem Rock Art in Cuba and Yucatán The intersection of culture and nature, "a worlding like no other" (Risatti 2007:202), is embodied in CircumCaribbean speleothem rock art. Typically, these feature face-like forms, having the visual effect of transforming the cave from mere passive support into an integral part of the imagery. This allows for a mode of communication beyond a simple signifier-signified relationship, that of a face-to-face human encounter. The "nature" part of the work (the cave) both activates and is activated by the "culture" part (the resulting image)--communication with a uniquely human affect. Cave art from Cuba and Yucatán will illustrate this phenomenon. Morales López, Abel [67] see Folan, William J.

Rich flora and physiographic characteristics have made the area difficult to map with traditional methods. This project is the first to incorporate LiDAR data and GIS mapping to the known archaeological features and hydrology of the landscape.

Morell-Hart, Shanti (U.C.

A secondary focus is the incorporation of linguistic- and practicebased approaches in the macro- and micro-botanical analysis of artifacts and places, and in the interpretation of taxa assemblages. A case study from the Ulua Valley, Honduras, is used to briefly illustrate one route to implementing these approaches. [45] First Chair [62] see Barden, Allison J.

However, quantifying efficiency of bipolar versus freehand reduction of pebbles is required. Is bipolar reduction the most efficient technique for utilizing bits of flint? Using experimental replication, this question was explored by comparing the products of bipolar reduction and freehand knapping on small chalk flint pebbles. Analysis of standard efficiency measures (e.g. amount of cutting edge, core consumption, number of blanks produced) between bipolar and freehand knapping suggests efficiency may not have been the rationale for bipolar reduction.

Chronological data indicate lodge construction and use temporally corresponding to very

late prehistoric high-altitude residential occupations in the Great Basin, but also substantial occupation prior to 700 BP. Though data are preliminary and work at the site is ongoing, the site appears to represent an early case of high-altitude intensification calling into question the roles forcing mechanisms like climate change and population pressure play in the development of high-altitude residential strategies.

In this paper, we present the results of a petrographic study designed to reach beyond sourcing and investigate political economy within the Late Classic Motul de San José polity in the Central Petén Lakes area of Guatemala. This study draws on utilitarian and elite pottery from several sites, and defines various paste recipes. The distribution of these paste recipes throughout the area suggests some degree of centralization in the ceramic economy of the Motul polity. Morin, Eugene (Trent University) [17] Revisiting the Body Size Rule The use of prey size as a measure of net return rates is controversial in archaeology, as this proxy does not always predict resource rank accurately. Among others, variations in prey mobility can undermine this proxy. In this paper, the relationship between velocity and prey size is investigated. The results suggest that species fall on two different curves when top speed is plotted against body size. Using ethnographic data, it is shown that the strength of this rule correlates with environmental variables. Bergmann's rule, an ecogeographic generalization that examines latitudinal change in animal size, seems to mediate this pattern. Morin, Jesse (University of British Columbia) [160] Nephrite/Jade: The Preeminent Celt Stone of the Pacific Northwest Nephrite/jade was a toolstone that was widely used in the Pacific Northwest for making ground stone celts. It is a semiprecious gemstone renowned for its aesthetic characteristics, and is also the toughest known rock. These dual attributes of extreme toughness and beauty made nephrite a highly desirable material for manufacturing celts, and these celts were widely exchanged across the Pacific Northwest. This paper describes the spatial distribution of nephrite source locations in British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon, and describes the locations where indigenous nephrite working occurred based on the distribution of the sawn nephrite cores from which celts were produced.

The south area has also been characterized as the dirty area because of high traffic; by implication a lower status space. Based upon ethnoarchaeological models and personal experience with Native American sacred structures, I argue that the south area of Çatalhöyük`s houses was likely a cosmologically charged space. This interpretation differs from previous approaches to Çatalhöyük`s household spaces in that it connects all the spaces of the house around a unified model of cosmological understanding. Moss, Madonna (University of Oregon) [263] [4000 Years of Tlingit Salmon Use at Coffman Cove, Alaska, and the Question of Resource Depression] Many historical ecological studies focus on cycles of resource depression and rebound. At most Northwest Coast archaeological sites, however, evidence for resource depression is lacking (Butler and Campbell 2004). At Coffman Cove, salmon were used over a long period, but detecting resource depression requires identification of one or more of six salmon species, each with its own natural cycle of abundance. Radiography and size are used to assess the species composition of the salmon caught by Coffman Cove residents. These results are evaluated in light of species-specific knowledge of fluctuating abundance to determine whether or not resource depression occurred.

Many of these objects are of sunburst design and appear to have been worn on the chest as solar reflectors. As such, they played a symbolic role in early agricultural societies that were ritually focused on three interrelated factors for survival: sun, water and fertility, factors also symbolized in ornaments of emerald green jadeite and transparent quartz. Moyes, Holley (University of California, Merced) and Jaime J. Awe (Institute of Archaeology, Belize) [266] The oldest ritual caves in the Maya Lowlands Cave archaeologists note that early settlement not visible at surface sites may be inferred from cave deposits. Early Preclassic AMS dates from Chechem Ha Cave in the Macal Valley, Belize are coeval with some of the earliest Maya surface sites located in the adjacent Belize Valley. Because there is little evidence for Early Preclassic settlement around Chechem Ha, it has been assumed that the site functioned as a pilgrimage place. However, recent dating of two nearby caves suggests that early cave use was more widespread than previously imagined. This invites us to reconsider the antiquity of the area's settlement.

ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 76TH ANNUAL MEETING

Hierakonpolis, a major Predynastic (3800-3200 BC) site in Upper Egypt, has yielded extraordinary artifacts for more than a century. Recently thousands of broken ostrich eggshell fragments were found at HK6, the elite cemetery. The minimum number of whole eggs present at any location was determined by measuring the fragment area and dividing by a whole reference egg area. A total minimum of 22 were found, more at any other Egyptian site of the period. An easier, but less accurate, weight method was considered and rejected. Evidence suggests that this is the first use of ostrich eggs as rebirth symbols. Mulhern, Dawn (Fort Lewis College) [188] Biological and cultural interpretations from Falls Creek: Evidence from the human skeletal remains Human remains from a Basketmaker II site at the Falls Creek Rock Shelters, north of Durango, Colorado, exhibit a range of preservation, from complete mummification to complete skeletonization. The mummified remains provide glimpses into the culture of the Basketmaker people, particularly aspects of mortuary practices. Biological data regarding the age and sex structure appear to indicate a preference for burying women and children at this site, with more subadults than expected and underrepresentation of adult males. Biological analysis also reveals several cases of similar developmental anomalies that could be indicative of close genetic relationships. Mullane, Elizabeth (Stanford University) [43] Identity as an Emergent Property: An Iron Age India Case Study In this paper, I propose that identity may be categorized as an emergent property.

While applications are widely employed in the analysis of ecological and biological systems, I will discuss how emergent properties may provide insight into archaeological questions of the human past. As a case study, I will examine how the emergence of a new Megalithic identity transformed Iron Age India.

Beginning in the Preclassic period, the construction of monumental buildings contributed to the development of a newly stratified political landscape in the southern Maya lowlands. Temples and monuments dominated the architectural core of major Maya centers, but were also built in peripheral areas. Evidence from the small ritual center of Anonal indicates that this tradition of monumental building began as early as the fifth-century B.C. Long-term use of Anonal`s temple complex suggests that this site was an important locus of commemoration activity in the greater Ceibal landscape. [145] Discussant Munson, Marit (Trent University) [260] The Problem With Pictures: Identifying Images in Southwestern Archaeology Humans are probably hard-wired to seek patterns that can be recognized as pictures, a process so fundamental that it seems simple. When archaeologists assume that recognizing images is a matter of common sense, they end up with inconsistent and often improbable identifications. This paper addresses the problems of identifying ancient pictures, drawing on research from psychology that provides insight into the processes of representation and interpretation. Using examples from Southwest rock art, kiva murals, and ceramics, I argue that archaeologists need to consider the process of representation in order to make more explicit and less value-laden identifications of images. Murakami, Tatsuya (University of South Florida) [92] Lime plaster production and the politics of urban construction at Teotihuacan, Mexico This paper addresses the degree to which the state controlled lime plaster production in the construction of urban buildings at Teotihuacan through the analysis of technological variability, focusing on the recipe and quality of lime plasters. Social relations are often encoded in subtle technical choices and therefore the analysis of technological variability provides a basis for assessing the relationship between multiple production groups. The results of petrographic and cathodoluminescence analyses suggest that both the recipe and quality were centrally controlled by the state and that this centralized production underwent a significant change by the last phase of the Teotihuacan period.

AMS dates and ceramic chronology both point to a Late Preclassic origin with evidence for salt production confined to the Late Classic period. Surprisingly devoid of habitational debris, the site apparently was formed by recursive deposition of production-related debris. The absence of kiln fragments supports the notion that open-air firing was the primary firing technology. As one of the few non-residential sites

amidst mangrove swamps, WCA contains intriguing evidence regarding the tempo of mound formation and the practice of pottery. Murdock, Jana (Elon University) [148] The Role of Environmental Degradation in Collapse as Studied Through the Ancient Maya in the Eastern Petén Forest of Northwestern Belize Much recent research addresses the notions of environmental degradation and the depopulation of the central Maya lowlands in the Terminal Classic. An analysis of soil samples and stratigraphy from 10 test pits at the household site of Grupo Agua Lluvia in the eastern Petèn forest will help to determine how soil composition changed between pre-Maya occupation, Maya occupation, and post-Maya occupation, as indicated visually by differences in soil color, texture, and composition. The results of this research endeavor to establish the chronology for and extent of environmental impact by ancient Maya culture in the eastern Petèn. Murley, Daniel (Sonoma County Heritage Network) and Sandra Hollimon (Santa Rosa Junior College) [48] The Archaeology of Native Californian Gender Systems We discuss recent developments in the archaeology of gender and examples of applications in California archaeology. These include examinations of sexuality, the multiple axes of identity that include gender and other variables, and systems of gender that are non-binary. We will also discuss analytical approaches that have grown from gender archaeology, such as the examination of the lifecourse in the archaeological record, identity formation, and osteobiography.

The tombs around the Greek Bronze Age palace at Pylos (1600- 1100 B.C) consist of chamber tombs that are hollowed out of the rock and tholos tombs that are built. Frequently these tombs are perceived to have similar rituals and related social functions. By mapping the artifacts found in the tombs, in the entrance to the tombs and outside of them, I examine the evidence for repeated action in and around the tombs. I then explore the socioeconomic significance of these actions by presenting models of how they can be interpreted and related to the changes at the palace.

This type of situation occurs frequently enough to require the recent development and presentation of specialized training on both submerged cultural resources law enforcement and submerged cultural resources damage assessment. Musser-Lopez, Ruth (RiverAHA (Archaeological Heritage Associates)) [158] Understanding Prehistoric Commerce,Technology and the Chronological Position of the Portable Milling Tool Production and Stone Sculpture on the Lower Colorado River via the Functional Context of Associated Rock Art. Formed portable metates associated with corn meal preparation are found in sites along the Lower Colorado River. Milling tool production sites are spatially associated with petroglyphs, creating the potential for cross-dating the metates and associated petroglyphs. Stylistic differences and changes through time and the functional context of rock art in physical association of prehistoric milling tool production along trails linking production sites with coastal California, reveal a lively Lower Colorado River prehistoric rock sculpting tradition. This tradition continued into the historic period, evidenced by oral history as well as standing structures attributed to the last known Mojave sculptor. Mutin, Benjamin (Harvard University) [140] Cultural Dynamics in Southern Middle-Asia during Protohistory (6th ­ 3rd millennium BC): an overview based on recent researches on ceramic traditions This paper presents results from recent researches conducted upon ceramic productions from southeastern Iran and Pakistan. While it has been assumed that several dynamics and developments observed in MiddleAsia during Protohistory resulted from influences from Mesopotamia and western Iran, it is now admitted that the situation was likely more contrasted. The results are embedded here in the broader context of southern Middle-Asia. It is suggested that the local and interregional processes are probably a key to understand the developments towards (and the sustainability and probably the collapse of the) greater complexity that characterized Middle-Asia in the 4th and 3rd mill.

Our target audience may have their own agendas and preconceived notions that affect if and how the data are used. An excellent example of this challenge can be seen in how conservation biologists use information about the Late Pleistocene extinctions.

However, closer analysis suggests that small islands played an important role in aboriginal economies, specifically on the Georgia coast (US). Systematic testing of a back-barrier island between Colonel`s Island and St. Catherines Island, Georgia revealed over 4,500 years of aboriginal activity.

patterns of elemental enrichment and depletion might suggest the nature and locations of activities when the floor was a living surface. Dried fish of several species, shrimp, and corn meal were also analyzed in order to derive expectations about how food processing might affect the elemental signature. Highly enriched phosphorus in the floor samples confirms that animal and/or plant tissues were processed on the floor and contributed to the elemental signature. In addition, patterns of enrichment and dilution of phosphorus and other elements appear to indicate locations where these activities were concentrated. Neff, Hector [5] see Lipo, Carl P.

Focusing on remains from the Basketmaker III period, preliminary results show a majority of turkeys belonging to the dominant domestic haplotype seen elsewhere in the ancient Southwest with the remainder belonging to a previously unrecognized and perhaps an additional domestic lineage of turkey in the region. Sex ratios, determined through coprolite morphology and genetic sexing, also shed light onto the demographic nuances of turkey domestication.

Here, I reconsider the Paleoarchaic lithic landscape of these foragers - the potential realm of procurement - by exploring (1) the possibility of "sourcing" chert artifacts and (2) the technological variability represented amongst chert artifacts at a series of Paleoarchaic lithic assemblages in east-central Nevada. These data complement previous analyses of obsidian and establish a baseline against which models of Paleoarchaic mobility and lithic procurement may be evaluated.

By reconstructing the seals of these officials and examining their uses over the period covered by the sequence of dumping deposits, we can gain an important synchronic snapshot of the development of the Egyptian state.

Artifact presence or absence is frequently the only criteria used to define the horizontal extent of archaeological sites. Artifact transport by natural agents such as water and gravity is known to move artifacts from their primary context, though experimental simulated wind conditions demonstrate that small-size debitage also may be transported by wind. The effect of wind on artifact distribution is explored using data from a large lithic workshop exposed to high wind speeds. This study suggests that wind sorting can be recognized through the horizontal distribution of artifact size across a site to determine the location of the primary deposit.

In examining ways in which archaeology can address this shifting focus, applied studies of Traditional Environmental Knowledge (TEK) would seem to fit the bill. However, recent critics note that environmental comanagement applying TEK can lead to subtle forms of environmental injustice. This paper examines TEK and its potential and problematic solutions for an applied archaeology. [252] Discussant Norman, Garth (ARCON, Inc.) [28] 2012 and Beyond: Origins at Izapa Calendar research of the Izapa Temple Center reveals two Five World Ages systems based on the Olmec Calendar Round that preceded invention of the shorter Maya Long Count (during the Late Preclassic). The 260day cycle, tied to Izapa's 15 degree north latitude zenith passage, relates to astronomical observation of equinox precession. This is anchored to Calendar Round dates on Stelae 5 and 12. These new discoveries reveal the importance and antiquity of the Calendar Round that dominated Mesoamerica before the Classic Maya era and after the Maya collapse. Norman, Lauren [159] see Friesen, Max Norman, Neil (William and Mary) [198] Surplus Houses: Palace Politics in the Bight of Benin West Africa, 1650-1727 A.D. This paper explores a series of relatively massive architectural features in the Kingdom of Hueda. It argues that the houses are best explained in terms of Jane Guyer's notion of "Wealth in People" in that they materialized labor relations between kings and non-elites and played into local elite competition over regional prominence. It further argues that these houses served as the focal point of surpluses generated from Atlantic economic exchanges. Normark, Johan (Göteborg University) [214] Dealing with the Public View of the Maya The public view of the Maya is often affected by stereotypes, exoticism, and ethnocentrism. Nowhere is this clearer than in the 2012-phenomenon. While blogging about various parts of this phenomenon I have encountered everything from threats, dismissals on the grounds that I am biased because I am part of the academia but also positive feedback on the attempt to uncover frauds. Although my blog primarily is dedicated to Mayanist studies and archaeological theory, the 2012 part of the blog is most popular. How does that affect my choice of topics? Am I also feeding on the phenomenon that I criticize? Normark, Johan [67] see Shaw, Justine M. Norton, William (Archaeological Research Center, CSU, Sacramento) and Mark Basgall (Archaeological Research Center, California State University, Sacramento) [150] Stuck in the Middle: On the Nature of CoastalInterior Interactions Ethnohistoric records suggest that aboriginal California populations articulated their exploitation of coastal and interior resources in complex ways, either using a

strategy of seasonal transhumance to access the two habitats or moving resources via logistical organization. These alternatives have been difficult to identify strictly on the basis of archaeological remains, complicating attempts to assess the nature and time-depth of these land-use patterns in the deeper past. Intensive investigations at Camp Roberts in San Luis Obispo County, California, suggest significant shifts in how inland populations exploited coastal environments and marine resources during the late Holocene era. Novic, Juliana [58] Ancient Urban Viewscapes: Viewing Monumental Architecture at Calixtlahuaca The city of Calixtlahuaca in the Toluca Valley of Mexico has a unique configuration of monumental architecture when compared to other Aztec City-State capitals. I examine the viewscape as seen upon entering the urban center of Calixtlahuaca using least cost-path and viewshed analyses. Changes in the viewscape through time will be incorporated into the viewshed model. The goal is to examine questions of monumentality and power. Novotny, Anna (Arizona State University) [56] The Stacking Principle and Ancestral Transformation: Bodies and life essences in an ancient Maya farming community Ancestors were, and continue to be, the foundation of Maya communities. However, individual transformation into an ancestor is not well understood. Cross-culturally, treatment of the deceased body is linked to beliefs about the fate of the soul, or life-essence. Among the ancient Maya burial treatment includes vertical stacking of bodies within one grave. Stacking of objects represents material transformation in ancient Maya iconography. Contextualized bioarchaeological data, including sequence of body deposition and individual life-histories of the deceased, are presented from the site of Chan, Belize, to investigate the stacking principle and its role in attaining ancestral status. Nygard, Travis (Ripon College) and Linnea Wren (Gustavus Adolphus College) [102] Bridging Archaeological and Art Historical Methodologies in the Cochuah Region of Mexico: A Study of Space at the Maya Site Yo`okop Archaeologists and art historians have a keen interest in understanding the spatial properties of the world. In this paper the authors consider how approaches from these disciplines complement each other when analyzing the past. The authors use the Maya site Yo`okop in the Cochuah region of Mexico as a case study, showing how the site`s spatial properties changed during the Formative through the Postclassic periods. This region has been analyzed by members of the Cochuah Regional Archaeological Survey since 2000, which the authors joined for the 2001 field season. Data used includes the built environment and pictorial space. ORourke, Dennis H. [126] see Broughton, Jack M.

The Ishi context in particular and the Yahi/Yana ethnographies in general have greatly influenced the nature of archaeological research and interpretation in this area. Is the Ishi/Yana context appropriate for framing archaeological investigations, or does it represent a tyranny of the ethnographic record that masks a more complex native presence? This paper examines the broader regional context of archaeological work conducted by the Lassen National Forest and others in this area in the 60 years since Baumhoff`s first excavations at Kingsley Cave.

Sunday Eiselt (Southern Methodist University) and Felipe Ortega [207] Thermal Efficiency and Durability of Micaceous Clay Cookware from the Northern Rio Grande: An Experiment In northern New Mexico, micaceous clay occurs in high elevation Precambrian formations containing superabundant levels of mica. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this clay has thermal and physical properties that make it an excellent choice for cookware, but these properties have never been formally tested in a laboratory setting. This study expands upon a previous experiment which focused on the thermal efficiency of micaceous pottery. The revised experiment incorporates additional variables that may have a bearing on the use of this clay for cookware in the Northern Rio Grande since AD 1300, including resistance to thermal shock and physical impacts.

Lisa Sattenspiel (University of Missouri-Columbia) [124] The Identification of Prehistoric Amazonian Slashand-Burn Cultivation Practices Using an Agent-Based Model Agent-based modeling offers unique insight into questions concerning slash-and-burn cultivation practices of prehistoric Amazonian populations. Due to the poor preservation of some botanical remains and a paucity of ethnographic records on cultivation practices in Amazonia, little is known on the prehistoric cultivation practices of indigenous populations. The Amazonian Slash-and-Burn Model and the Succession Model, both agent-based models, were developed to help address how much influence prehistoric Amazonian populations had on their surrounding environment and if different cultivation strategies could be identified in subsequent forest composition. The results suggest that different slash-and-burn cultivation strategies can potentially be identified in paleoecological records. O'Brien, Michael (University of Missouri) [126] R.

[255] Early Bronze Age & Early Iron Age couch potatoes ­ Is there evidence for mobility at the sites of Singen & Magdalenenberg? The Early Bronze Age necropolis of Singen and the Early Iron Age burial mound of Magdalenenberg represent two populations from periods of technological transition in southwestern Germany. The purpose of this study is to investigate possible mobility and to reconstruct human diets using isotopic analysis. We analyzed the ratios of strontium and oxygen isotopes in human enamel since this reflects the provenance in early childhood. Additionally, sulphur isotopes from bone collagen were used as geological tracer reflecting the provenance during the last decade of life. We can differentiate local and non-local individuals by combining these different isotope systems. Oestmo, Simen (Arizona State University), Benjamin Schoville (Arizona State University) and Jayne Wilkins (University of Toronto) [108] Preliminary Taphonomic and Technological Analysis of a Middle Stone Age (MSA) Open-Air Lithic Assemblage at Nautilus Bay, Western Cape, South Africa Here we present preliminary taphonomic and technological analyses of a MSA lithic assemblage from an exposed ancient land-surface suggestive of an intact paleosol at Nautilus Bay, South Africa. Total-station piece plotting of artifact orientation/dip, artifact size distributions, and the exposed surface side-up of artifacts, suggests the lithic assemblage has undergone limited post-depositional disturbance. Technological analysis indicates early stage lithic reduction, evidenced by large tested cobbles with few removals, and a high percentage of dorsal cortex. Nautilus Bay expands the range of MSA behavioral variation to areas outside of cave contexts along the southern coast of South Africa. Ogburn, Dennis (University of North Carolina at Charlotte) and Nicholas Tripcevich (UC Berkeley) [267] Variation in Inca Building Stone Quarry Operations in Ecuador and Peru Data from a number of Inca stone quarries are examined to explore the variability in Inca organization of the activity of producing cut-stone building blocks in the heartland of Cusco, Peru and the southern highlands of Ecuador. Great variability is seen in the size of quarries, distance from construction sites, and the associated facilities constructed to support quarrying activities. In contrast, all quarries were similar in location near major roads, type of stone, and steps of ashlar preparation undertaken at the quarry. The sacred nature of quarries and building stone in the Inca Empire is also explored.

The present project will compile a mortuary database for the Flagstaff region in conjunction with the creation of other regional databases using standardized variable states. These efforts will allow a greater contextual understanding of the Magician within his local community, as well as with other regions, especially the foundational ritual practices of the Chaco region and the later practices of diasporic communities below the Mogollon Rim. [113] Presenter Okumura, Mercedes (University of Sao Paulo, Brazil) and Astolfo Araujo (Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, University of Sao Paulo) [6] The bifacial points from Southeastern Brazil: Chronospatial characterization through statistical analysis It has been proposed that the Umbu tradition, whose definition is based on the presence of bifacial points, would have originated in Southeastern Brazil around 10,000 BP and it would be still observed around 1,500 BP. So far, very few chronological markers have been identified. That, together with its extended chronological frame, resulted in much controversy about the actual existence of such a tradition. We aim to illuminate questions related to the characterization of that tradition, the possible changes in the size and shape of these bifacial points through time and the chrono-spatial relationship among point groups.

In order to better understand ancient Maya dog importance, dog remains from eleven Maya sites ranging in date from the Preclassic (2350 BP) through the Late Classic (977 BP) were analyzed. Three methods were used: bone morphology and metrics, stable isotope bone chemistry, and mortuary treatment analysis. By combining these data sets this study finds trends in dog dietary pattern through time, between regions, and among breeds.

The Great Plaza at Tikal functioned as a gathering place, like Complex A it was a space where part of its footprint lay buried. Pavements, offerings, and structures mark this place as sacred and indicative of a larger narrative. This environment will be explored as an ensemble of interrelated parts resulting in a nuanced interpretation of the co-existence of history and ideology.

While much was known about the period of the jail`s construction and use from historical documents, relatively little was known of the physical structure itself until excavations revealed the building`s foundations and large quantities of artifacts. Additionally, local media coverage brought out an interested public with largely unknown photos, maps, and stories, enriching knowledge of the regional political battles during an important era in the Rust Belt`s history.

The timing and nature of these developments, however, are widely variable and have been securely documented for relatively few regions of the culture area. This paper explores these issues through a synthesis of recent research in southern Haida Gwaii which is providing evidence for subsistence specialization (documented in zooarchaeological assemblages) and the proliferation of mass harvesting technologies (intertidal and riverine fish weirs) during the late Holocene.

In this paper, I present new typological and design attribute data from Tsama Pueblo, an ancestral Tewa site in the Chama Valley, which lends support to migration models. In this assemblage, the Mesa Verde design style is far more apparent than has

While each technique displayed interesting advantages, all made their strongest archaeological contribution in the realm of bottom imaging and feature identification, i.e., in creating a detailed model of the past landscape. While several techniques identified stone configurations consistent with ethnographically known hunting structures, they were less successful at detecting more traditional archaeological features such as hearths or lithic scatters. The implications of this finding for submerged archaeological survey are discussed.

Plazas in south-central Veracruz were larger and squarer in shape, possibly reflecting variations in building and using space in plaza activities. Comparisons between plazas within Cerro de las Mesas and the later centers of Azuzules and Nopiloa indicate some intraregional differences in access and population accommodation during the Classic period (A.D. 300-900). Finally, the apparent disappearance of prior plaza groups by the Middle Postclassic period (A.D. 1200- 1350) indicates a shift in political use of public spaces linked to a new population.

Outram, Alan Keith (University of Exeter) and Richard Evershed (University of Bristol) [126] A comparison of the middle-range processes affecting sub-fossil, chemical residue and stable isotope evidence, with a consideration of their differing quantitative value within zooarchaeological studies. For more than a century zooarchaeologists have developed sophisticated models for understanding middle-range issues such as taphonomy, site formation processes and quantification. Recently developed methods, such as residue analyses, or dietary reconstruction through stable isotope analysis, have clear and direct zooarchaeological implications. However, zooarchaeologists need to develop similar middle-range understandings of these new lines of evidence in order to integrate their results to best effect. Employing examples, this paper considers the very different ways in which these three proxies of animal production and consumption are formed, preserved and sampled, and what the implications are for zooarchaeological quantification.

Analytical methodologies currently used to examine prehistoric Lowlands Maya ceramic data, such as the Type-Variety system, oftentimes discount the influence that diversity in social setting, depositional context, and landscape may have upon pattering in pottery production and consumption. This paper intends to examine refined ceramic analysis methodology that will facilitate investigation of the influence that this contextual diversity may have on prehistoric Maya Lowland ceramic assemblages. [85] First Chair Paglione, Teresa (USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service) [87] "Collectors are Complaining about Conservation Tillage" A 1979 survey to document archeological sites along the Alabama River resulted in the discovery of hundreds of sites, most of which were in plowed fields. In 1991, there were over 2 million acres of row crops in Alabama; in 2009 this number dwindled to less than half that. Trees and hayfields have replaced cropped fields. This is a good thing for site preservation but now it is harder to relocate old sites or find new sites - or at least requires more time and effort when shovel testing is required. Pailes, Matthew (University of Arizona) [106] Network Analysis of Household Interaction at a Thirteenth Century Hohokam Village This research utilizes network analysis to explore household interaction patterns of a prehistoric Hohokam village, Cerro Prieto (ca AD 1150-1300). In this application, groups of habitation structures are treated as nodes and interconnecting walkways as edges. Households are evaluated in terms of their centrality in relation to their neighbors and the larger network. Centrality reflects a node`s ability to constrain or direct the social interaction of its neighbors and the larger network. At Cerro Prieto, measures of centrality are correlated with architectural and demographic patterns that are reflective of the material and human capital controlled by households.

Palka, Joel (University of Illinois-Chicago) [200] Contact Period Maya Shrines and Settlements in Rural Lowland Chiapas, Mexico Charlton`s historical archaeology has influenced research in rural areas in Mesoamerica. Charlton demonstrated that indigenous culture change from the conquest to the present in the countryside differed qualitatively from urban areas. This presentation covers recent investigations of Maya shrine use in forest communities far from Spanish towns in lowland Chiapas. Archaeology, ethnohistory, and community collaborations have been productive for understanding native culture change over the last 500 years in unconquered Maya territory. The findings suggest that Maya pilgrimage and shrine use was related to indigenous sacred landscapes and identity in contested frontiers rather than ritual continuity and social memory. Palomo, Juan (University of Arizona) [225] The Path of Dead: Deposition of Human Remains in Ceibal Excavations in Ceibal exposed a considerable quantity of well preserved human remains. These burials date from Middle Preclassic to Terminal Classic (c. 900 BC- AD 900). Osteological analyses revealed different patterns of burial deposition and few cut marks on the bones, providing a window into the cultural processes that led to their deposition. In addition to the archaeological data from the site, ethnohistory and iconography are referenced to reconstruct possible activities that took place in the areas where burials were recovered. Palumbo, Scott (College of Lake County) [93] Resource Control and the Evolution of the Complex Society in Western Panama This paper briefly summarizes perspectives on political economies in Southern Central America and Northern South America before exploring the character of social changes in the highlands of Western Panama. The relatively ephemeral nature of complex society in this region is analyzed, and discussed with reference to broader studies concerning economic production and social organization. Panich, Lee (Santa Clara University) [229] Archaeological Perspectives on the Persistence of Indigenous Identity in Colonial Contexts Recent archaeological research in colonial North America is challenging prior assumptions about the nature of indigenous identity and culture change. Rather than simply charting the loss of native cultural traits, many archaeologists are instead carefully examining particular contexts and practices to understand better how native cultures and identities persisted even as they were reinterpreted. Often, this research has developed through close collaboration with descendant communities. In this paper, I will review the growing and

diverse archaeological literature on the persistence of native identity from the perspective of my own research on Spanish colonialism in Alta and Baja California.

A Public Funeral Covered With Ilopango (Tbj) Ash in Western El Salvador. The Ilopango volcanic ash (TBJ) is ubiquitous in El Salvador´s archaeological record. Layers of this white powder usually cover both agricultural fields and public plazas at abandoned civic centers. New data from Ataco, in Western El Salvador may indicate the cultural use of the white ash in a Terminal Classic interment where Preclassic Monuments were deposited as part of the offering. Botanical remains preserved within this context have been identified as corn kernels and pepper (piper nigrum), suggesting the ingestion of Chilate, a maizebased beverage still very popular among Salvadorans. Parezo, Nancy (University of Arizona) [18] [Multidisciplinary Archaeology and the Production of Knowledge It is said that great minds think alike. But it is also true that great minds challenge themselves and others by searching for alternative ways of thinking and interpretive frameworks in order to eliminate intellectual blinders and complacency. This search helps scholars gain new insights into cultural processes and cultural history as well as the sociocultural production of knowledge. In this introduction to the session, I will look at how Don Fowler has led the way in this undertaking and provided models for how session participants can assess past, present and current archaeological activities using multidisciplinary and historically contextualized perspectives [18] First Chair Paris, Elizabeth (University at Albany-SUNY) [88] Early Use of Chipped Stone at the Tlacuachero Site, Soconusco, Chiapas At Late Archaic period shell mound sites along the Pacific Coast of Chiapas such as Tlacuachero, chipped stone artifacts were extraordinarily scarce. Most of these artifacts are bipolar percussion flakes produced from small ignimbrite nodules from the nearby Tajumulco source, and are particularly associated with clay floor deposits stratified within bedded shell deposits. Some flakes possess edge damage consistent with use as microdrills, and may have been used to produce fishhooks or other artifacts. Such uses of chipped stone technology would be consistent with the role of the site as a seasonal fishing and shellfish processing site for lagoonal resources.

the Dover Quarry Sites, Tennessee not only gives us insight into behavioral systems but also on the geologic provenience of the chert deposits. Survey data of the quarry sites is presented that emphasizes the relationship between quarrying activities and the variable geographic occurrence of Dover chert. Geologic research of the region gives information regarding the stratigraphic position of Dover chert within the study area. This combined with a detailed survey of the quarry sites reveals the dynamic relationship that prehistoric miners had with the resource and its uneven distribution on the landscape. Park, Sunmi [149] The Buffer Zone Trade in Manchuria and the Korean peninsula c. third century BC to third century AD. The ancient Chinese coins have been discovered in Manchuria and the northwest Korean peninsula, where Ko-Choson was historically active, c. third century BC to third century AD. Interestingly there was no influx of those currencies in the southern area of the peninsula. When Ko-Choson collapsed in the first century B.C., the coinage prevailed in the southern area. This suggests that Ko-Choson had some sort of unique form of exchange going on. I used to name this type of exchange as Buffer Zone Trade`. I will talk about the tr ade system, focusing on coins and polities.

Several elite and non-elite structures in two residential groups contain a rich floor assemblage. Through an analysis of de facto refuse, this paper illustrates how the assemblage characterizes an example of small-scale rapid abandonment and what it suggests regarding the nature of the abandonment. Escalera al Cielo is considered in light of our present understanding of the political history of the Puuc region during the late 9th century A.D.

[216] First Chair Parsons, Jeffrey (University of Michigan) [200] Is Aztec IV Black/Orange pottery Late Postclassic, or Early Colonial, or both, and does it matter? Tom Charlton has demonstrated that some Late Aztec pottery types continued to be made and used well into the Colonial period in the Valley of Mexico. Although some Aztec IV Black/Orange pottery was clearly produced after the Spanish conquest, the precise dating of much of this material has remained uncertain, especially regarding how much of it antedates Spanish contact. Several excavations and surveys have revealed ceramic assemblages that contain exclusively Aztec IV B/O pottery without any accompanying Aztec III B/O. These findings, supported by Charlton`s earlier studies, indicate that Aztec IV B/O is exclusively Early Colonial in age, and that we may need to revise downward by perhaps 15% our estimates of Late Aztec population.

Pauketat, Timothy (University of Illinois), Danielle Benden (University of Wisconsin) and Robert Boszhardt [229] Cosmic Contact in the Upper Mississippi Valley Studies of historic-era contacts and colonies have focused on negotiations of identities between peoples. Recent excavations at a Precolumbian colony or mission settlement at the Trempealeau site, in Wisconsin, lead us to expand that focus and consider the wider social field involved in this mid-11th century AD episode. The local Effigy-Mound people`s encounter with the non-human agents of a new Cahokian religion was probably as significant as their engagement with the intrusive Cahokians themselves. Everything--from chert tools to pots, houses, and hilltop temples--appears to have been keyed to cosmic powers. The long-term historical consequences were potentially dramatic.

Using new research, this paper explores the implications of such differentiation through examination of the region surrounding the coastal town of Mikindani in southern Tanzania. In the early second millennium the inhabitants of this region began making a variety of ceramics unlike those of the Swahili coast, but similar to ceramics from the interior. Placing this shift within the context of other regional developments demonstrates how it was part of a complex response to changing conditions in the second millennium.

In the study of their production loci, problems can arise in the interpretation as structures used for oil and wine production are often similar to each other. The chemical analysis of the organic residues absorbed in the floors and in the basins used for the production is therefore fundamental in the interpretation of their function. We present the results of spot-tests and GC-MS analysis on plasters used to coat basins belonging to food production structures found in Roman and Late Roman sites in the Mediterranean area.

Pederson, Joel (Utah State University) and Gary O'Brien (Utah State University) [20] Relating the dynamic changes of the Colorado River to 6000 years of human occupation through geoarchaeologic investigations at nine sites along the length of Grand Canyon Intensive geomorphic and chronostratigraphic investigations have accompanied archaeological excavations in recent BoR treatment along the river corridor. This has revealed a record spanning the entire Holocene, constrained by scores of OSL and radiocarbon ages. To link the riverine paleoenvironmental record to settlement patterns and the preservation and erosion of cultural sites, we have focused on the key distinction between: a) changing paleoflood activity over centuries; and b) overall canyon-bottom aggradation and incision over millennia. We propose here that there are indeed characteristic paleolandscape contexts associated with distinct Archaic, Formative, and Protohistoric cultural sites along the river corridor.

In contrast to past studies based on typological analyses, I suggest that patterns of technological variation do not support the delineation of discrete boundaries between distinct social groups. Instead, I argue that technological variation was gradational and potters generally made vessels most similar to that of their closest neighbors. Exceptions to this pattern may provide evidence for migration. Peeples, Matthew [36] see Trask, Garrett L.

By the end of 12th century C.E., Angkor had expanded to become one of the largest settlements on Earth, facilitated in large part by the use of a networked water management system that was at once massive and intricate. This paper argues that the iterative growth of this system gradually restricted or removed alternative strategies for managing resources, leaving the settlement uniquely exposed to the impact of the 'mega-droughts' that would develop in the 14th and 15th centuries.

These representations clearly allude to the numerous pyrite mosaic mirrors that have been discovered in diverse archaeological contexts at Teotihuacan, as well as in other regions where the center`s influence extended. In this presentation, we attempt to clarify the ritual usage of these objects based on a detailed analysis of the contexts in which they were recovered. We also compare the Teotihuacan data with findings from the Maya highlands of Guatemala in order to understand how these objects were integrated within these two contemporaneous societies. [58] see Michelet, Dominique Perez, Don (EBI Consulting) [243] Petrographic Analysis of Potsherds from the Ancient Maya Site of Copan Petrographic analysis entails the microscopic observation of ceramic materials in thin section. Although often used to address issues of material sourcing, it can be a means of investigating pottery production. Analysis of a small sample of potsherds from the ancient Maya site of Copán indicates that the ceramic fabrics can be classified into types based upon the relative abundances of fine volcanic ash and mineral grains. These fabric types reflect divergent methods of making vessels. Combining fabric type classification with that of type-variety may provide insights into production trends from the ProtoClassic through the Classic period at Copán.

Picha, Paul (State Hist Soc of North Dakota) [211] Berlin, Vansina, and Washburn Revisited: Color, Cognition, and Symmetry in the Mandan Archaeological Record The material and mental are embedded in the Mandan archaeological record of the Missouri River valley. Interdisciplinary contributors­Brent Berlin (color terminology and folk taxonomy), Jan Vansina (culture as cognitive reality), and Dorothy Washburn (embedded symmetry)­each provide a general framework suitable to investigating Mandan culture history. Conjoining natural and cultural elements in ceremony was recognized by George Catlin in his writings and accompanying artwork on the Mandan Okipa ceremony. The eastern tent caterpillar (Malacosoma americanum) is an example of duality and cognition expressed as culture. Combining the three methods in a unified application reveals the complexity of Mandan adaptation. Pickard, Catriona [255] see Bonsall, Clive Pickering, Sean (University of Calgary) and Peter Dawson (University of Calgary) [159] Continuity and change in southern Kivalliq land use patterns, and their implications for the emergence of Caribou Inuit Culture. One of the defining features of Thule culture is a complex, coastally focused subsistence-settlement system structured around logistical mobility. The development of the Caribou Inuit cultural pattern seems to represent a repurposing of this strategy to inland locations, where caribou herds were intercepted at important river and lake crossings. In this paper, we evaluate the idea that this repurposing reflects the continuation of important Thule cultural values into the historic period, and the consequences this may have had for cultural resilience in a changing arctic environment.

[55] Multi-scalar perspectives on Iroquoian ceramics: A re-examination of the West Duffins Creek site sequence During the late precontact period, small Iroquoian village communities in south-central Ontario came together into large village aggregates of unprecedented size. Our analyses of ceramic collections from one site relocation sequence have produced new insights into the social and temporal relationships between these villages during this period of community coalescence. In this paper we evaluate the strengths and limitations of using ceramic design sequences to interpret changes in local sociopolitical organization, and suggest that more synthetic research is required in order to understand the relationship between local and regional variation in ceramic design in the Lower Great Lakes region.

This paper applies these two methodologies to study seasonality during the transition from post-glacial foraging lifestyles at the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary to the rise of sedentary agricultural communities in the Neolithic. The cave sites of Pupicina, Nugljanska, and Vela Spilja in the Northern Adriatic are presented as case studies.

Pillsbury, Joanne (Dumbarton Oaks) [125] Architecture and Ritual on a Lambayeque Vessel It has been a truism in north coast archaeology that narrative imagery ceases with the end of Moche, replaced by a visual style that emphasized repetitive decorative patterns. This change in the mode of representation has meant scholars have had a more limited view into the elusive practices and beliefs of later north coast societies. Yet recent research suggests a narrative tradition continued, offering a richly informative window into ritual practices, particularly the presentation of goods within carefully defined architectural spaces. These representations open up new potentials for understanding the use of specific building types. Pinhasi, R. [114] see Adler, Daniel S.

[245] Beyond the grave: Continuity among Chanka populations in the Andahuaylas Province, Peru. This study focuses on several skeletal populations dating to the Middle Horizon (AD 600 ­ 1000) through the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1000-1400) recovered as part of the Proyecto Bioarqueologico Andahuaylas. The sample is comprised of individuals that, according to the ethnohistorical record, likely identified ethnically as Chanka. Population genetic tests address biological affinity of individuals between mortuary contexts and over time. The results have important implications for our understanding of mortuary ritual as it is linked with social organization, and the effects of the collapse of the Wari on the genetic structure of a regional population. Pinkston, Erin (UC Berkeley) [28] Symbolism of the Skull: A Case Study of Significance of Human Heads in Maya Termination Rituals In the Mesoamerican worldview, a variety of beings are privileged with souls. Outside of humans, both animals and various key inanimate objects, including plants and architecture, are entitled to ensoulment. I would argue here that due, in part, to their participation in this worldview, the ancient Maya practiced similar burial rituals for humans and termination rituals for architectural structures. I will further argue that these similarities are more striking when analyzing the repeated skull/head symbolism in both, specifically at the site Colha in Belize.

[183] Early Changes in the Ceramic Sequence within Nicaragua: An Examination of the Tempisque and Bagaces Periods The Tempisque and Bagaces periods in Nicaragua contain distinct types of ceramics that have not been greatly researched. The site of La Arenera corresponds to the Tempisque period, while Las Delicias is thought to be part of the Tempisque-Bagaces transition. Ceramics and Radiocarbon dates from La Arenera are compared to the Las Delicias site. There are key types of ceramics that are found at the beginning and end of the Bagaces period but are not continuous or continuations from the earlier Tempisque period. The purpose is to determine if Bagaces warrants subdivisions into smaller periods based on the ceramics. Plimpton, Christine [246] The Origin of Egyptian House Space Permeability Pattern Syntactic analysis performed on Egyptian dwellings from the Old Kingdom to the present revealed grammar constancy in space permeability (access patterning). The two grammar rules discovered (symmetric:nondistributed and asymmetric:nondistributed) restrict the movement of people within the dwelling. This analysis concentrates on determining the origin of the enduring restrictive grammar patterns in house permeability. Although data on dwellings are often limited in description for the periods preceding the Dynastic, it appears that the restrictive grammar rules emerge in the Archaic period with the formation of the Egyptian state. Pliska, Janine (Pennsylvania State University) [51] Chiefdom Development at Cerro Juan Díaz: a Mortuary Analysis The archaeological site of Cerro Juan Díaz, on the Pacific coast of Panama, (200 BC to AD 1600) has produced over four hundred human remains from a formal cemetery that was continually used throughout the site`s occupation. The arrangement of the graveyard, as well as skeletal analysis, provides an excellent opportunity to compare social structure before, during, and after the formation of a chiefdom-level society (at approximately AD 500). Analysis of trends in diversity and type of burials in the period before the emergence of the chiefdom help clarify from what social relationships stratified hierarchy developed.

As we try to understand the lives of prehistoric people, we must consider ritual dynamics motivating and structuring their interactions with the world around them. However, ritual activity expected within a given social system is relatively unknown. We quantify and model ritual activity as a response to latitudinal and environmental gradients. Using Information Theory, we compare our models, selecting the best model given the data. We use the archaeological record to test how well our model predicts ritualized activity in a prehistoric context. Powers, Robert [223] Volcanic Agriculture on the Pajarito Plateau Maize agriculture was the economic focus of rapidly expanding ancestral Puebloan communities established on the southern Pajarito Plateau of New Mexico in the 13th and 14th centures. In contrast to adjacent northern Rio Grande areas where Pueblo farmers built extensive and labor-intensive gravel mulch and gridded terrace fields, Pajaritan fields display little evidence of labor or long-term use. These ephemeral fields may owe much to the Plateau's pumice laden volcanic soils and to Puebloan experimentation with, and in the short-term, successful farming of these unusual soils. Archaeological, pedological, and hydrological evidence evaluating Pajaritan volcanic soils are presented.

Excavations there revealed that visitors were channeled through a narrow corridor and staircase system. A room with six grinding stones documents communal food preparation, and other areas of the main structure likely temporarily housed goods or people entering the valley. Taukachi Tardio provides insights into Casma Culture administrative practices, specifically the degree of intervalley access control.

A newly defined age range based on a small sample of well-dated Clovis sites reduces previous estimates of the duration of Clovis by

several hundred years, and therefore, it has been argued, supports the spread of Clovis technology through existing populations rather than the spread of populations themselves throughout the continent. By simulating colonization, accounting for taphonomic bias, and sampling the resulting distribution of sites, this paper demonstrates that a small sample of well-dated Clovis sites is incapable of accurately representing the true duration of the colonization event.

However, there is a general lack of continuing experimental work to determine whether a specific method is applicable to a given archaeological assemblage. Here, we discuss the experimental replication of certain key aspects of an archaeological chipped-stone assemblage based on small gravel cherts.

Our research shows the ecological context shifted under the feet of the early Hawaiians as the number of feet (and mouths) grew. We show how this line of inquiry can be used to complement and help interpret the archaeological and ethnographic record. Punzo, Jose (Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia) [147] Tratamientos funerarios entre los xiximes de la Sierra Madre Occidental, en el estado de Durango, México. Los xiximes fueron los habitantes de la Sierra Madre Occidental en el actual estado de Durango, a la llegada de los españoles, y estos tuvieron distintas prácticas funerarias que los diferenciaron de todos sus vecinos. Estas consistían mayormente en la construcción de urnas funerarias de tierra, en las partes más escarpadas de los acantilados, donde colocaban a sus muertos y les colocaban sus ofrendas. Sin embargo en la presente ponencia exploraremos no solo esa práctica, sino cuestiones asociadas a la antropofagia ritual que estos desarrollaron, así como otras prácticas funerarias que hemos podido identificar mediante trabajos arqueológicos y etnohistóricos.

Wright (Seoul National University) [223] Prehistoric Agrosystems of Central Arizona: A Paleoenvironmental Approach to the Study of Hohokam Irrigated Fields and Canals For more than a millennium, Hohokam farmers developed large-scale irrigation along the Middle Gila River in the Phoenix Basin. Excavations near Upper Santan Village recently uncovered a section of prehistoric irrigated agricultural fields. To reconstruct this agro-ecosystem, an interdisciplinary approach combining geoarchaeological, micromorphological, magnetic, chemical and paleoecological data was conducted on irrigation canals and associated fields. This study allowed us to reconstruct past human-environment interaction at a local scale, identify signatures of irrigated and managed soils and evaluate their preservation, compare paleoenvironmental signatures in irrigation canals and fields, and estimate the impact of long-term farming on soil properties. Puseman, Kathryn (Paleo Research Institute), Eileen Johnson (Texas Tech University) and Peter Kovacik (Paleoresearch Institute, Inc.) [66] Charcoal, Wood, Paleoenvironment, and Radiocarbon Dating Identification of charcoal and wood fragments from the Yellow House System in Lubbock, Texas provides information about the paleoenvironment and selection of woods for specific uses, such as fuel and construction. Looking at microanatomy at high power allows identification of small charcoal fragments. This type of analysis also provides a critical piece of information

necessary prior to radiocarbon dating. Identifying the charcoal being dated and knowing and using the average life spans of the charred material as a guide to understanding the relationship between dates are crucial to building an accurate temporal record of environment and culture. Pyburn, K. (Indiana University) [254] World Heritage: Universality or Just Globalization? Preservation and research are unproblematic concepts to most archaeologists and many sectors of the public. Remnants of the human past with scientific merit and often great beauty are commonly regarded not the property of a single culture or of the descendants of their creators, but as the property of all human beings and the appropriate preserve of science. But recently attempts to foster the preservation of important monuments and artifacts and research the cultures of the past across the globe have resulted in some new ideas about what archaeological preservation and research really are and why in any particular case certain people may be in favor of them while a surprisingly large number are not. Ultimately, these controversies have forced archaeologists and the public to consider exactly what is important about the past, and what archaeology has to do with answering the question. [268] Discussant [197] Discussant Pye, Jeremy (University of Florida) [235] Faces from the Past: History of Ceramic Memorial Portraits on Grave-Markers Ceramic memorial portraits capture the images of people in the past. Through their expressions, fashions, and depicted relationships, the people staring out from these images tell the viewer intimate stories, stories which are different for each passerby. The context of their placement, on grave-markers, adds yet another layer of meaning. As a form of archaeological artifact, they provide insights into individual and cultural identity. Moreover, they reflect individual and/or family attempts to construct a specific representation of the decedent. Ceramic memorial portraits capture memories and moments in time, link the past to the present, and preserve history for the future. Pykles, Benjamin (State University of New York at Potsdam) [82] A New Archaeology in the New Deal: The Rise of Historical Archaeology in the 1930s Although there are isolated examples of what today we call historical archaeology from as early as the seventeenth century, the discipline had its formal beginnings in the 1930s with the New Deal excavations at Jamestown, Virginia ­ the first permanent English settlement in North America. The Jamestown excavations, led by Jean Carl Harrington, were among the first federally sponsored historical archaeology projects in North America and constitute the true institutional beginnings of the discipline. It was during these excavations that Harrington pioneered many of the fundamental methods and practices still used by historical archaeologists throughout the world today.

In the Maras region, the local population was forcibly migrated and replaced with royal estate investment. At Cheqoq, an Inka staple storage and ceramic production center linked to the Cusco elite, recent excavations of a workshop and domestic contexts yield new data on socioeconomic status differentiation and the role of the estate administrator under Inka nobility. We are studying production, diet, and sumptuary practices of attached specialists and storage administrators to evaluate imperial resettlement policies and the function of economic spheres under elite and state control.

The paper will explore the procedural, resource, and management issues related to renewable energy projects, focusing on case studies in the California Desert District of the Bureau of Land Management. [112] Discussant Quezada, Osiris [224] The Stone and their Ways of Extraction at Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan in the Pre-Columbian period In the Pre-Columbian period, the stone extraction for building required an adequate knowledge and technical skills, about of the physical properties of the raw materials for their correct exploitation. This investigation examines the archaeological evidences of the transformation process of the building materials used at the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan, procurement, modification and use. For this study we combined petrographic and geomorphological analyses with ethnographic work in two different quarries, where currently are extracted similar materials as employed at the Huey Teocalli of Tenochtitlan. Quinn, Colin (University of Michigan) and Ian Kuijt (University of Notre Dame) [226] Smoke Signals: Variability in Social Discourse, Display, and Deposition of the Dead in Prehistoric Ireland Like other forms of treatment of the dead, cremation is highly variable in practice, context, and social meaning. Elucidating patterns within this variability is necessary for developing nuanced social interpretations. By tracking the pathways of the body through the tempo, location, visibility, and technique of cremations, we explore

diachronic and synchronic differences in social organization, ritual beliefs, and conceptualizations of the body between the Irish Neolithic and Bronze Ages. This approach emphasizes how mortuary practices both reflect and actively modify the role of the dead, communal and individual identities, and social relationships in the contemporary societies of the living.

Previous studies of assemblages recovered from several large inhumations throughout the region reflect that 50% of males and 30% of females present antemortem craniofacial trauma. When coupled with ethnohistorical accounts of widespread conspecific and extragroup violence, an opportunity for an anthropological investigation into the traumatic injuries represented exists. Comparisons with other huntergatherer groups whom also engage in conspecific and/or extragroup violence may aid drawing a more cogent picture of Pericú lifeways. Raab, L.

[81] Refining Site Probability Model Criteria for USACE Properties on the Upper Tenn-Tom Waterway: Section 110 Survey for the Mobile District, USACE As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Brockington and Associates conducted cultural resources survey at various USACE properties across the southeastern U.S. Among those properties were approximately 3500 acres within the Tenn-Tom Wildlife Mitigation Area (WMA) identified as having a high probability for archaeological resources. Using the TennTom WMA high probability survey results, more specific environmental correlates were identified, which have allowed for a refined site probability model. The proposed conference poster is intended to illustrate contrasting probability data and how this information can be used to prioritize future archaeological research in the region. Raczek, Teresa (University of New Hampshire) [189] When Possessions are Few: Mobility, Materiality, and Minimalism in Northwest India The practice of high mobility is strongly correlated with minimalist consumption patterns. Previous research on craft production of highly mobile groups has emphasized functional analyses that focus on the portability, utility, and flexibility of lithic tools, pottery, and other items. However, it is also important to consider the relationship between consumption, production and the construction of

Alca is the only Peruvian obsidian known to have geographically patterned geochemical variation within an extensive source region. This characteristic allows highresolution provenance determination of artifacts and makes the Alca source an ideal place to evaluate various extraction and distribution scenarios. We present new geochemical data obtained on obsidian artifacts from archaeological sites local and extra-local to the Alca source region and discuss potential social and economic implications.

Ragsdale, Corey (University of New Mexico) and Keith Prufer (University of New Mexico) [162] Isla del Idolo: a survey of an endangered archaeological site in Veracruz, Mexico Here results are presented from an initial survey conducted on a possible pre-Hispanic Gulf Coast occupation site. The site is located on Isla del Idolo in the Tamiahua Lagoon, Veracruz, Mexico. Findings are comparable with structures and burials found in adjacent regions around Mexico. The construction of a man-made

outlet on the southern point of the lagoon in the 1950`s has caused recession and erosion due to rising water levels, and consequently to the exposure of hundreds of archaeological artifacts and human remains in immediate danger of being lost. Action toward the preservation of these remains should be considered. Railey, Jim (SWCA - Albuquerque) [7] Spatial Zoning and the Shift from "Formal" to "Expedient" Flaked-stone Technologies The temporal shift from formal to expedient flakedstone technologies has been the subject of several competing explanations, variously emphasizing reduced mobility, intensification of farming and other methods of food production, and the advent of the bow and arrow. Another factor that may help explain this apparent shift is the marked increase in spatial zoning that occurred with the advent of sedentism. This poster presents several instances in which formal-tool production occurred in spatially restricted loci in late prehistoric sedentary settlements in North America, and focuses on a case study from a Pueblo-period site in New Mexico. Rains Clauss, Lee [197] Discussant [197] First Chair [197] Second Organizer Rakita, Gordon (University of North Florida) [143] The Mortuary Practices of the Casas Grandes Region: A Preliminary Database I present a preliminary regional database of mortuary practices for the Casas Grandes region of Chihuahua, Mexico. The reported prehistoric mortuary remains from the region are overwhelmingly drawn from the Paquime and Convento sites reported by Charles C. DiPeso and colleagues. Often overlooked, however, are several smaller samples that are reported with less detail. Given the complex nature of mortuary ritual from the region (especially in the late ceramic periods), the structure of the database and the recorded variables is equally complex. The data highlight several challenges to establishing a regional database of Southwestern mortuary practices.

Guadalajara) [98] The anthropomorphic representation in the Aztatlan Tradition (850-1300 AD), Western Mexico. An approach The Aztatlán Tradition was widespread in Western Mexico between 850 and 1300 AD. One of its most remarkable characteristics is the introduction of new iconography in the region, which stands out because of its ritual and religious thematic and it has been related to as codex style. Of particular interest are the anthropomorphic representations, especially in some codex style pottery vessels. It has been noticed that some of these representations might correspond to different gods; figures also dressed up with attributes of some deities. This paper attempts to approach human representations and some of its meanings in the Aztatlán Tradition.

In this presentation we examine assemblages from quarry/workshops in Costa Rica and Panama in order to compare the lithic reduction sequence of Central American Clovis to both the North

American Clovis reduction sequence and the Fluted Fishtail reduction sequence from Panama. Because no faunal or floral remains are preserved in Clovis sites, we infer subsistence strategies from the Late Pleistocene ecological contexts in which Clovis sites and isolated points have been found. Ranere, Anthony [213] see Cooke, Richard G. Rasic, Jeff [62] see Reid, Devon [7] see Tremayne, Andrew H. Raslich, Frank (Michigan State University) [29] Implications of the Stylistic Effects of Population Inmigration on Mississippian and Oneota Projectile Point Assemblages Projectile point assemblages from two central Illinois River Valley sites, Larson (11F1109) and Morton Village (11F2) are analyzed to gain an understanding of the morphological and metric changes that occur when an inmigration of outside populations transpires. The Larson site, a primarily Mississippian site with both Mississippian and Oneota populations, provides an excellent unit of analysis for comparison to the Morton Village site. Isolation of the kind and degree of any directional stylistic or metric statistical relationships that occur contains potential to provide archaeologists with deeper insights into how intergroup interaction and migration may impact stylistic variation within lithic assemblages. Rauh, Whitnie, John Dudgeon (Idaho State University/CAMAS), David Peterson (Idaho State University), Clayton Meredith (Idaho State University) and Nick Holmer (Idaho State University) [63] Comparison of Methodological Approaches for Determining Modes of Trace Metal Uptake in Archaeological Skeletal Remains By combining high-precision SEM-EDS with the trace element sensitivity of LA-ICP-MS, we demonstrate that it is possible to separate and account for the variable signature of biogenic metal uptake during life, versus diagenetic post-depositional alteration in archaeological bone. Middle Bronze Age human and animal bone is analyzed to determine the probability of identifying copper and bronze producers through trace metal uptake. LA-ICP-MS trace element chemistry calibrated by SEM-EDS can distinguish and quantify patterns of occupational uptake and diagenesis. We feel this combined methodology is a suitable alternative for liquid ICP-MS analysis, which suffers from the homogenizing effects of bulk sampling. Rautman, Alison (Michigan State University) [86] Aggregation in the North American Puebloan Southwest The archaeological record of the Puebloan Southwest is characterized very generally by two widespread and obvious changes in settlement pattern: a shift from pithouse architecture to contiguous above-ground structures, and population nucleation, or coalescence, into pueblos that can include many hundreds of rooms. Although the proximate causes of population aggregation vary across the Southwest, these settlement changes express and codify in spatial terms a single social strategy for managing changes in the scale, frequency, and/or intensity of social interactions.

Using a series of controlled experiments replicating carbonized food residues, we assess how alkali processing using wood ash may affect maize's detectability in d13C isotope assays. Even with high proportions of maize present, C3 producers have been demonstrated to mask the presence of maize, a C4 plant. This results in false negatives for the presence of maize. We report on experimental outcomes that help answer the question: Does alkali hominy processing of maize with ash result in low detectability in carbonized food residues? Ready, Elspeth (Stanford University) [2] Prey choice and skeletal transport strategies during the Mousterian at Gatzarria Cave, southwestern France This paper examines Neandertal foraging behaviours at Gatzarria Cave, a Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition site in the Atlantic Pyrenees. Prey and patch selection by Neandertals from Gatzarria suggest a focus on a single prey species from lowland habitats. Skeletal part patterns are investigated using several utility indices, which demonstrate that transport decisions aimed to maximize the delivery of high-quality marrow fat. The foraging behaviours documented at Gatzarria are considered in the context of broader subsistence patterns in Western Europe during the Middle and early Upper Palaeolithic. Reber, Eleanora (UNC Wilmington) and Matthew Kerr (UNC Wilmington) [19] Diagenesis and Soil-Sherd Interactions in Experimentally Produced Black Drink Residues Black drink is a North American native caffeinated tea produced from the leaves of Ilex vomitoria.

As such, the ability to identify archaeological Black drink residues would be valuable to southeastern archaeologists. Black drink was repeatedly made in experimentally produced unglazed pottery. Residue-containing potsherds were buried in several different environmental contexts and then underwent absorbed pottery residue analysis in order to determine how diagenesis and soil-sherd interactions would affect the residues.

Unlike its younger, sister community at Aztec, New Mexico, Salmon passed through its Chacoan occupation quickly, with architectural, as well as social and ritual, changes apparent in the community by AD 1130. As the remainder of the Chacoan World collapsed and readjusted, Salmon`s inhabitants assumed a largely local orientation to their economy and social identities.

Reeves, Jonathan (State University of New York at Potsdam) and Benjamin Pykles (State University of New York at Potsdam) [158] Illuminating Iosepa: Hawaiian Petroglyphs in Skull Valley, Utah From 1889 to 1917 the town of Iosepa in Utah`s Skull Valley was occupied by mostly Hawaiian converts to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Iosepa represents a place of cultural synthesis where the traditional Hawaiian culture of the town`s inhabitants and their new Mormon belief system were negotiated in unique and complex ways. One manifestation of this cultural negotiation is the petroglyphs engraved by the people of Iosepa on a large boulder overlooking the town site.

To examine this, we use XRF technology to provide a direct evaluation of compositional variation of basalt and other low silica volcanic rocks from stratified or radiocarbon dated archaeological sites in the upper Alaska Peninsula and Kodiak Island during the Holocene. Artifacts from selected museum collections and geological source samples are analyzed using a portable XRF (PXRF) machine.

However, their distinctive manufacturing technology and patterns of re-use have often been submerged and blurred in broader discussions of a regional fluted tradition that includes Folsom and other proximally thinned lanceolates. Furthermore, the temporal priority of a Western Stemmed tradition is sometimes asserted from the absence of an established Clovis chronology in Idaho. We review evidence for a discernible Clovis horizon in Idaho that exploited at least four regional obsidians and several cherts (but no andesites) and that fits within a time frame of 11,200 - 10,800 rcybp. Reindel, Markus (German Archaeological Institute, Bonn, Germany) and Thomas Stoellner [267] Mining Archaeology in the Nasca and Palpa region, south coast of Peru While research about mining archaeology in the Andes has focussed mainly on the north coast of Peru, the south coast has been widely neglected despite of some pioneering studies which pointed to the importance of the region. In the interdisciplinary Nasca-Palpa project we documented mining activities in the vicinity of prehispanic settlements. We identified mines and quarries, as well as working places with stone tools. Mineral samples were tested in the laboratory. The preliminary results demonstrate the importance of the region for the production of gold, copper, semi-precious stones and obsidian especially in the Paracas, Nasca and Late Intermediate period. Reinhart, Katrinka (Stanford University) [228] Politics of food at the Chinese Bronze Age site of Yanshi Shangcheng Social inequality and ancestor worship are rooted in the Neolithic in China.

Reitze, William (University of Arizona) [231] A Geoarchaeological Interpretation of Lake Estancia, New Mexico This study presents a model of human land use as it is influenced by environmental change at the PleistoceneHolocene transition in the Estancia Basin, New Mexico. The Estancia Basin contained the eastern most pluvial lake in the Southwest, presenting a unique opportunity for Paleoindian foraging groups during the PleistoceneHolocene transition. The suite of resources available in the basin likely differed from those encountered elsewhere on the Southern Plains. A reinterpretation of lake levels, ages, and potential subsistence resources, drawn from geoarchaeological analysis, is compared to archaeological records of land use developed from reanalysis of large surface collections from the basin.

The later, symbol-laden pottery is particularly interesting because of the drastic regional shift it represents from the earlier, minimally decorated red-on-brown and plain wares. Employing an ethnographic analogy to modern and historically documented Huichol gourd bowls, I propose two archaeologically examinable hypotheses about the nature of social interactions within and outside the Aztatlán region that could have lead to this major change in material culture.

One mound in particular yielded the remains of five partially intact bodies that had been killed while they slept ­massive and thick sheets of sea ice overtopped the bluff and crushed the house, leaving all artifacts in their last used position. New data were discovered on house structure and storage patterns, topics typically overlooked in the ethnographic record which tended to focus on whaling and other subsistence activities. This paper examines storage in the small, enclosed space that was the Inupiat iglu, suggesting that patterns of what is absent and what is present in the house represents a glimpse at the cultural organization of a prehistoric household.

While the hypothesis has been proposed that specialized economies appeared during the Early Upper Paleolithic, few studies have focused on this topic in Mousterian context. We address the question of Neanderthal specialized hunting through an overview of different Mousterian assemblages from Southwestern France in the MIS 4/3. These examples suggest that multiple different subsistence strategies were developed by Mousterian populations and specialized economies may have been used in response to specific climatic constraints.

A similar claim for Kayenta in-migration into the Phoenix Basin and proposed Verde Confederacy is significantly weaker, and not supported by multiple lines of evidence. Migration would tend to follow established exchange/social relationships, and we discuss alternate cases (using ceramic, architectural and mortuary data) in which migrations into the Phoenix Basin occurred along welldocumented connections to the Middle Verde and Lower Gila.

archaeological investigations that led to the identification of the Schlage site and excavation of 78 pit features. Pit fill included a variety of domestic debris as well as an additional set of human remains. What is remarkable about the Schlage site materials is that the archaeological deposits were preserved beneath the roadbed of a United States highway. The presence of well-preserved archaeological deposits beneath a modern U.S. highway suggests that archaeological monitoring may be prudent during reconstruction of existing roadways when the route traverses archaeologically sensitive areas.

This study was undertaken to explore the nature of canid diets at this site through time, and especially to focus on the relative importance of salmon in their diets. Although dogs are not a direct proxy for humans in dietary isotope studies, their diets are influenced by human dietary practices, and therefore indicative of human subsistence strategies and activities. The isotope results are compared to results from humans and canids from other sites in British Columbia. Richards, Michael [255] see Oelze, Vicky M.

Rizvi, Uzma (Pratt Institute) [189] Crafting Resonance: Third Millennium BC Copper Arrowheads from Ganeshwar, Rajasthan. Crafting copper objects is often understood through technological ingenuity and metallurgical analysis. Using the corpus of copper arrowheads from Ganeshwar, Rajasthan as a case study, this paper investigates the simultaneous constructions of social and economic environments that reflect subjectivities within populations in which these objects were made, used, and circulated, through the concept of resonance. The notion of resonance is theorized as a form of power that the object has beyond its formal boundaries within larger planes of perception creating dynamic relationships between the object and the viewer/user/maker, illustrating cultural decisions based on forms of the object as vibrant matter.

This paper discusses burial ritual at the Early-Middle Neolithic burial and "cult of water" site of Scaloria Cave, Italy. In contrast to rites practiced in nearby villages, the dead at Scaloria Cave were subject to a prolonged procedure of defleshing with stone tools and secondary deposition; detailed taphonomic study reveals different patterns for juveniles and adults, and through isotopic analysis we also investigate the relation between how the dead were treated and where they came from. This death ritual is put into the context of the well-known Neolithic way of life in southeastern Italy and the unique ritual meanings attached to Scaloria Cave.

When people from different cultural backgrounds meet, their personal experiences become entangled with new customs introduced by foreigners. Artistic systems preserve the way individuals entangled their past experiences as a series of references to other aspects of reality embedded in representational objects. By tracing how objects of art were fashioned to make references, and what these references emphasize or ignore, I hope to better understand the acculturation process of early medieval English people in the 5th and 6th centuries AD.

[67] Complexity and Regionalization in the Late Classic Maya Highlands The Late Classic period in the Maya highlands has been overshadowed by significant and long-standing research on the Preclassic and Postclassic periods. Recent investigations in two different highland areas, however, have underscored the regional complexity of the archaeological record during the Late Classic. In this paper the authors question highland homogeneity during this period by examining categories of material culture across the region. They hypothesize that the region displays great sub-regional heterogeneity rather than an overarching sociocultural uniformity as often implied by external perspectives.

chronometer for nuanced questioning about prehistoric societies depends on soundness of method. We assess obstacles facing the technique by examining several sources of uncertainty and error--ranging broadly from measurement accuracy to modeling of the hydration process. Factors that need to be better understood include intrinsic variability (obsidian elemental composition and water content), environmental factors, and taphonomy (burial history: duration, disturbances, and depth). Rogers, J. (Smithsonian Institution) [54] Settlements and Community in the Dynamics of Inner Asian Empires By 200 B.C. Inner Asia saw the development of expansive and complex political systems. At the heart of these polities was a concept of community that cross-cut important dimensions of residence, kinship, ethnicity, and political affiliation. For Inner Asia, community was linked to issues of mobility, scale, extra-local interactions, nonfixed property, dispersed control hierarchies, and the economics of multi-resource pastoralism. Based on a sample of 15 polities several patterns emerge that highlight how political processes altered and incorporated community and place in the building of fortified settlements, palaces, monasteries, and other constructions on the landscape.

Its Pre-Columbian presence on the West Coast of North America (by 2000 to 4000 B.P.) indicates that it entered the New World by a route other than through the Bering Strait region. The "North Pacific Drift Hypothesis" proposes that bejel reached the New World via Asian vessels caught in the current of the North Pacific Drift. Evidence for this includes the strong geographic correlation between the ancient distribution of

bejel in the New World, the coastal region of North America brushed by the North Pacific Drift, and the distribution of wrecked junks documented by early European contact.

ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 76TH ANNUAL MEETING

The study of fluted points in the Far West has been largely discouraged by the lack of Paleoindian sites with primary context, associated Pleistocene fauna and materials suitable for radiocarbon dating. As a result, the recognition of non-Clovis fluted point types in the Far West has lagged behind some other regions of North America. The CalFLUTED research project has studied 523 bifaces of which 458 are fluted. These specimens are mainly from California, Oregon and Nevada. Preliminary findings and lessons learned from these ongoing studies are presented. Roney, John [199] see Hard, Robert J. Roney, John R. [244] see MacWilliams, Arthur C.

Rorabaugh, Adam (Washington State University) [232] Exploring Variation in Sociocultural Transmission Between Blade and Hafting Elements of Chipped Stone and Ground Slate Points in the Salish Sea, Northwest North America. On the Northwest Coast, archaeologists have documented clear shifts in social organization occurring over the past 3,000 years. The implications of this transition for social learning have been less explored. Cultural transmission models suggest that factors such as the growing importance of prestige may be reflected in material culture (biased transmission). Formed lithics from the Salish Sea were examined to determine whether learning followed models of neutral evolution (increasing variation) or directed change (promoting consistency), suggesting an increasing importance of prestige. These data suggest neutral evolution pointing towards a mosaic of factors contributing to the lithic technologies of the region.

This project seeks to understand the spiritual, historic, economic and political significance of this region surrounding the birthplace of Confucius. Geoarchaeological sections and cores show a number of Holocene geomorphological episodes. These were related to both environmental and human-induced landscape changes in the region. Preliminary results suggest one of the most significant landscape impacts was caused by major deforestation during the later Zhou or the Early Han period (first millennium BCE).

Shugar (Buffalo State College) and Jacob Vardi (BenGurion University) [22] Wear, Attributes, and Types in Sickle Segment Analysis: Odellian Perspectives Analyses of glossy blades from Tell Jemmeh in southwestern Israel (5th through 2nd millennium BC) using techniques covering a range of scales and approaches confirms their primary function as sickle segments, and offers insights into such issues as relative use-life, value, and specialization. In particular, increased use-life is reflected both in heavier gloss, clearly a function of abrasion. There is a significant correlation between heavier gloss and increased edge retouch. These probably reflect increased value; both are correlated with greater production specialization. Use-life, value, and specialization all increase in time, reflecting a trajectory increasing economic complexity. Rosenfeld, Silvana (Stanford University) [70] Foodways and Socio-politics in the Wari Empire: examples from the core and the province (Ayacucho and Cuzco, Peru AD 600-900). In Andean archaeology, the social meanings of food have been mainly examined through the analysis of culinary equipment- ceramic types and styles. However, our current understanding of Andean foodways can be improved by the addition of a zooarchaeological perspective. Examination of actual food refuse can reveal the factors that produce variation in the use of animals in daily and ritual consumption. In this paper I examine the ritual and quotidian animal use through the faunal analysis of three archaeological sites (Conchopata, Cotocotuyoc, and Chokepukio) to generate new information about how the Wari presence impacted the local communities in the province Rosenstein, Dana (University of Arizona), Robert T. Downs (University of Arizona) and Pamela Vandiver (University of Arizona) [5] Structure and function: mineralogical analyses of tempers in Late Iron Age ceramics from southern Africa using optical petrography, x-ray diffraction and raman spectrometry Mineralogical analyses of ceramics from the Late Iron Age of southern Africa show that lustrous, platy and fibrous mineral tempers were commonly added to clay by the late 18th century CE. One indigenous response to colonialism was large-scale centralization. Settlement aggregation had significant effects on the scale of production at these new centers. Craft standardization is one solution for providing for the needs of a large population. These mineral inclusions changed not only the aesthetic properties of the pot, but also the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of the clay, decreasing crack propagation and thus potentially increasing vessel yield.

Wright (Gila River Indian Community Cultural Resource Management Program) and M.K. Woodson (Gila River Indian Community Cultural Resource Management Program) [115] Application of Remote Sensing Technologies for Understanding Buried Canals on the Gila River Indian Community, Arizona This paper summarizes pilot research on the potential of remote sensing methods and data in detecting prehistoric canals in the Middle Gila River Valley, Arizona. Different types of widely available remote sensing imagery were researched for their efficacy as a methods-based solution to resolving broader themes of prehistoric settlement. The results suggest that the resolution of the imagery is the most important factor in detecting prehistoric canals, but modern ground disturbances and ages of canals were also significant considerations. This study shows that the regional view provided by remote sensing enhances the chances of detecting buried prehistoric irrigation features. Roth, Barbara (UNLV) [94] Foragers, Farmers, and In Between: Variability in the Late Archaic of Southern Arizona Recent decades have witnessed substantial changes in our interpretations of the Late Archaic of southern Arizona, as large-scale excavations of deeply buried sites have exposed settlements with unforeseen levels of agricultural production. Debate continues over whether these groups were foragers who farmed, dedicated irrigation agriculturalists, or something in between. Here I explore the data base from across southern Arizona, including both floodplain and upland settings, to illustrate that variability existed over time and space during the Late Archaic. The level of flexibility observed in these groups indicates that they were sometimes foragers, sometimes farmers, and sometimes both.

Several primary and numerous secondary tool stone quarries with fair to excellent quality silicates were exploited by First Nations people for the last 7000 years in the Thompson River drainage of south-central British Columbia. Many sources have stone with distinctive signature colours and textures that allow easy visual identification in archaeological assemblages. Descriptions of these sources, and the physical nature of stone type(s) found at them, are presented for future comparative and reference purposes. Models for local post-quarrying behaviour and inter-regional cultural dispersal of various distinctive lithic raw material types are also presented and discussed.

Rowe, Robert (Picketwire Research) [201] The Pit Cremation to Palette Ratios along Hohokam Canal 7 System During the summer of 2005, excavations within a portion of the Hohokam village of Las Canopas resulted in the recovery of 278 pit cremations. Associated with some of the cremations were palettes and the question was raised of why some and not all? During analysis, a ratio was determined between the number of pit cremations and the palettes. This same type of numerical analysis was conducted at other village sites along the same canal system resulting in basically the same ratio. Research suggests that the resulting ratio was based on status and clan associations of the individuals.

Through comparison of materials recovered at Buen Suceso and other Valdivia sites in the area, I present an outline for understanding the dynamic maintenance of tradition within Valdivia society.

The site consists of seven semi-subterranean sod houses located on the north shore of Oakes Bay at Dog Island that were occupied by Thule and Inuit. The principal goal of this study is to document the impact of human land use on the environment during the last centuries. The hypothesis is that Thule and Inuit activity and the Little Ice Age triggered the opening of the forest in the area. Rozo, Jennifer (University of Chicago)

Rothenberg, Kara (University of South Florida) [165] Multi-elemental Chemical Analysis of Anthropogenic Soils from the North Plaza, Palmarejo, Honduras Plazas were important spaces for expressing power and social identity in prehispanic Mesoamerica. However, plazas can be analytically problematic, because they were often kept clean of material debris. Previous geoarchaeological studies of anthropogenic soils and sediments have shown that specific activities leave characteristic chemical signatures on prepared earthen surfaces. The research presented here uses soil chemical residue analysis and excavation data to examine use patterns in the North Plaza of Palmarejo, Honduras during the Late Classic period. The results indicate that activities in the northern half of the plaza were distinct from those that occurred in the southern half.

[124] Transforming Landscapes, Transforming Lives: A Political Ecology of Plants, People, and Pueblos in Spanish Colonial New Mexico When Spanish colonists arrived in New Mexico, they brought more than men and colonial ambitions; they carried with them a host of weeds, seeds, diseases, and animals that dramatically impacted the social and physical worlds of the Pueblo peoples they encountered. Relying on political ecology and landscape theory more broadly, this paper explores the theoretical foundations necessary for interpreting the role of ecology in human affairs in a dynamic and meaningful way, while still privileging human agency. The argument is illustrated using specific examples from pollen samples collected from seventeenth-century field contexts associated with the Pueblo village of Paako.

These concepts are materialized in public monumental landscapes, but the domestic sphere is no less instrumental in forging people`s identity through daily practice. Extant evidence suggests that San Bartolo was abandoned in the Late Preclassic and resettled after four centuries of abandonment. Life histories of locales, particularly of the gradual changes in households on either side of the temporal spectrum, pre- and postabandonment, embody the relationships of people with each other and with the memory of the inhabitants of the ancient settlement.

[254] The ethics of oblivion and forgetting: Against archaeology's hypermodern heritage At the core of modern archaeology is a commitment to document and preserve evidence of the past, struggling against the tidal wave of modern progress. However, blind faith in the inherent good of generating socialscientific data simultaneously perpetuates the progress paradigm, constraining human understanding within linear, progress-based rationales inevitably leading to exclusion and oppression. Do all pasts need to be known or preserved? Should some pasts be forgotten? What are the pasts and heritages of archaeology itself that have been conveniently forgotten, and what insight do they bring to the behaviors, motives and implications of archaeological practice? Russell, Matthew (University of California, Berkeley) [153] [An Archaeological History of Historical Archaeology: Using Real-Time Kinematic GPS for Site Mapping to Locate Previous Excavations This paper highlights use of real-time kinematic GPS survey for archaeological site mapping to locate units excavated in the 1940s-1960s. It focuses on a current project at Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, California, which is exploring sixteenth-century intercultural engagements between California Indians and European explorers, to demonstrate how old archaeological projects can be reconstructed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to evaluate earlier results and address new questions. The first step in digitally reconstructing prior excavations is to accurately position the previous units, and a detailed topographic map of a site may reveal their presence. [48] see Schneider, Tsim D Russell, Will (Arizona State University) [36] The Terminal Hohokam Classic Period as a Revitalization Movement Traditional inquiries into Hohokam societal collapse focus on environmental transformation and human inabilities to respond. Reconsidering social actors as active participants rather than unwitting victims may shed light on the Terminal Classic period and whether this was necessarily tragic for all those involved. I examine historic revitalization movements in small scale societies and develop a cross-cultural template that can assist in identifying similar phenomena in the archaeological record. By integrating this template with indigenous histories, I argue that the Hohokam "collapse" may be better thought of as reorganization" initiated by a single man and supported by a disadvantaged subaltern.

Ruzicka, Denise (University of Nevada, Las Vegas) [201] Architecture and the Cosmos in the Mimbres Valley This study of a Late Pithouse Period Mimbres-Mogollon site in the American Southwest, the Harris Site in the upper Mimbres Valley in southwestern New Mexico, evaluates whether Mimbres pithouse groups observed astronomical phenomena and used such phenomena to guide the construction of their structures. The methods used in this investigation include evaluating whether the orientation and alignment of structures/houses as well as the presence of cultural features on surrounding ridge tops are related to the direction of celestial events. The results found an association between architecture and astronomy, as well as the landscape, at the Harris Site. Ryan, Beth [55] An Archaeological Analysis of Haudenosaunee Responses to Settler Colonialism in Post-Revolutionary New York State, ca 1784-1826. A comparison of the material remains and spatial organization of Tonawanda, Canawaugus and Ohadi reveals a variety of subsistence practices, craft production and interaction with surrounding markets, while still indicating connections between these Haudenosaunee communities across reservation boundaries. Coupled with a reevaluation of the rates of Euro-American settlement around each community and technologies of colonization deployed by local settlers, the comparison of the material record constructs a picture of locally contingent responses to various degrees and types of settler colonialism, a picture vastly more complex than the slums in the wilderness often described in the secondary historic and ethnohistoric literature. Ryan, Kevin (Missoula Fire Sciences Lab, RMRS, USFS) [192] Effects of fire in an archaeological context Fire, man`s first tool, was used to improve hunting, gathering, and grazing forage; clear, sites for agriculture; provide community-protection buffers, and for cooking, heating, tool-making and a variety of other cultural purposes. Fire affects vegetation dynamics at the site and landscape levels and has feedbacks to the climate system. Fire also affects cultural materials, a number of artifact/site dating techniques, and site formation and degradation processes. Thus, dynamic interactions between fire, vegetation, climate, and archaeology/anthropology are complex. This paper provides an overview of vegetation-fire dynamics, the effects of fire on archaeological materials and methods, and potential for confounded interpretation.

Various routes may have been followed south to the Salt River Valley, however, this alignment presents an intriguing possibility: by further projecting the trail to the southeast, it leads directly to the Classic Period site of Pueblo Grande. Perhaps a fanciful notion, but the idea that northern periphery inhabitants included ground stone manufacturing specialists who may have supplied the irrigated valley is not.

This analysis calculates potential routes of movement across the two regions to determine the extent to which the physical landscape influenced how and where migrants moved. These routes are used to predict the locations of intermediate migration sites to evaluate the potential timing and size of group movement and identify remnants of the transition in material culture.

Ideas about how people are differentially-positioned within class relations of surplus flow and the non-class political, economic, and cultural processes that sustain such relationships --ideas first explored by Marx and refined by subsequent generations of historical anthropologists --offer better frameworks for theorizing past organizational variation and change.

The source of olivine is thought to be at Mt. Trumbull and Tuweep in the Arizona Strip. LA-ICP-MS and INAA suggest that at least six clay sources were involved in the production of olivine-tempered ceramics found in the Mt. Trumbull and lowland Virgin areas 100 km west of Mt. Trumbull. In this paper, I will particularly examine how this production and distribution pattern changed over time. Optically stimulated luminescence dating is used to determine the age of the sherds from each compositional group.

The Chumash, sedentary complex hunter-gatherers in Southern California, underwent a rapid social reorganization (1150-1300 AD) leading to institutional hierarchy and formal craft specialization. This study considers a material basis for this change, based in part on changing access to high-quality, naturally-occurring asphaltum (bitumen). High-quality asphaltum (1) was a fundamental part of plank boat production, leading to improved trade capabilities and the demonstration the social status of boat owners, and (2) was itself a limited, naturally circumscribed resource distributed via exchange networks.

Cobbles with marginal flaking characteristics were systemically reduced to produce durable, short-use tools. Using traditional lithic analytical procedures and usewear analysis we show that tool-stone selection among Paleoindians was more complex than selecting for ultrahigh quality materials. Marginal tool -stone likely played an important role in the retooling of the Paleoindian toolkit. This aspect of Paleoindian archaeology is often overlooked.

However, in northern Kyushu, the Kinai-type pottery was imitated with the local pottery production technique. The Kinai-type pottery made locally in northern Kyushu was further exported to Iki island on the way to the Korean peninsula and the Korean peninsula. This indicates that polities in northern Kyushu were probably independent from the central polity in Kinai, and remained autonomousin in terms of pottery production.

[241] First Chair Savelle, James (McGill University) and Arthur Dyke (Geological Survey of Canada) [126] Paleontological and zooarchaeological evidence for Thule Inuit as bowhead whale hunters In attempting to interpret the role of the bowhead whale in Canadian Thule Inuit subsistence economies, many archaeologists are cautious when dealing with the question of hunting versus scavenging. The argument is usually made that it is difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish between whale bones derived from beached carcasses and bones derived from active hunting. This paper examines stranding rates, associated taphonomic processes and mortality profiles of naturally-stranded Holocene bowheads in the Canadian Arctic. It is concluded that whale bone assemblages at the vast majority of Thule sites can only be explained through active hunting. Savelle, James [159] see Johnson, Donald S. Sawchuk, Elizabeth (University of Alberta) [109] Analysis of Human Remains at the Mlambalasi Rock Shelter, Tanzania The Mlambalasi site in the Iringa region of Tanzania has a rich archaeological record that spans the historic period, Iron Age, and Later Stone Age. Excavations in 2002, 2006, and 2010 yielded commingled fragmentary human remains from a minimum of three individuals. The archaeological context of the remains and preliminary radiocarbon dates on shell suggest at least two of the skeletons could be Pleistocene Later Stone Age in origin.

Rock art documentation in these areas has evolved from articles inspired by the curiosity of canyon explorers, to efforts by archaeologists to describe and classify what initially appeared to be chaotic data. Now with a grip on cultural categories and time frames, hypotheses and methods have been developed to address the meaning and functions latent in these sites. In conjunction with other archaeological remains, rock art addresses the cognitive dimension of past cultures, posing new questions for the future. Schach, Emily (Arizona State University) [141] A multi-regional analysis of Ohio Hopewell gender This study approaches difference in gender relations between sites in the Scioto river valley and the Miami drainages. Burials from the Scioto river valley had greater disparity between sexed burials, with males buried more often with artifacts and possessing a greater average number of artifact classes. The Miami drainages had less disparity although the pattern there has more artifacts with female burials. Few artifact classes were buried exclusively with one sex. Gendered difference is emphasized in the Scioto river valley, but not in the Miami drainages, which may be a reflection of greater fluidity in gender in the Miami region.

Employing a multi-scalar, community-settlement approach, regional comparison of Xelhálh with neighboring settlements suggests it was a place of centralized power, collectivity and hierarchy, contrary to expectations based on current models of Central Coast Salish political-economy.

The Lacy Hotel was a boarding house that operated for roughly six years until General William Tecumseh Sherman burned it in 1864, leaving speculation to its exact location.

For the study area, some authors had argued that in Late Holocene times, rock art is actually reflecting the arising of territorial circumscription and ethnicity demarcation. But we had also considered other kind of information transmitted by means of this evidence. In this paper we will discuss and evaluate these hypotheses by means of cladistics and endemism analysis and bring new results obtained. Schieppati, Frank [60] see Hayward, Michele H.

It is suggested that sustaining any such trend over long periods requires episodic saltations in component technologies. Beyond invoking saltations as the immediate cause of a technological trend, a complete explanation identifies contextual--often social--factors that drive the process. This mode of explanation is illustrated by fast ocean liners of the 19th and 20th centuries. Schilling, Timothy [246] see Hildebrand, Elisabeth A. Schindler, Bill [61] see Cunnar, Geoffrey E.

Schmidt Dias, Adriana [101] Hunter-gatherer occupation of South Brazilian Atlantic Forest: archaeology and paleoenvironment The archaeological studies in South Brazil indicate a long term adaptive relation between hunter-gatherers societies and the Atlantic Forest, which presence since Pleistocene-Holocene transition contributed to the initial settlement of this region. Throughout the Holocene, most of the captured taxons of vertebrates belong to forest habitat. On the other hand, lithic industries` characteristics points to a stabilized pattern of technological organization and comparative analyses indicate an analogous technological style, suggesting a model of social organization characterized by a high degree of intergroup interaction, regulated by strategies of frequent residential mobility in a large regional territory [101] First Chair Schmitt, Dave (Desert Research Institute) and Karen Lupo (Washington State University) [126] On Early and Middle Holocene Environmental Change in the Eastern Great Basin: Some Additional Small-Mammal Data from Bonneville Estates Rockshelter Excavations at Bonneville Estates Rockshelter, Elko County, Nevada recovered rodent remains from stratified deposits spanning some 12,000 14C years. Specimens from the late Pleistocene-early Holocene include a number of species adapted to moist and cool environs containing grasses and sagebrush. Shortly after 9000 14C BP these mammals became locally extinct, or nearly so, taxonomic diversity declined, and the region became dominated by species adapted to xeric habitats. The Bonneville Estates early small-mammal record is similar to the records reported at Homestead and Camels Back caves and provides corroborative data on regional environmental change and mammalian responses to middle Holocene desertification.

This study explores the reasons behind the apotheosis of certain Mesopotamian kings by contextualizing that process within specific historical moments of political crisis. I argue that the sacralization of rulers in Mesopotamia was a strategic political exercise in crisis management, in which royal propaganda was used to reorient the locus of political agency away from the gods and focus that agency on embattled kings as a means to bolster their eroding political positions.

The pottery assemblage is dominated by shell-tempered, round-shouldered globular jars with decoration limited to various forms of crimping on the interior and exterior rim margins. This decoration is atypical for eastern Wisconsin Oneota and suggests that these groups may include more distinct regional variants than previously thought. This poster provides a morphological and compositional characterization of the Schlage site pottery in the context of other Eastern Oneota ceramic assemblages.

Case studies in this paper range from sixteenth-century encounters on the California coast to later, more permanent colonial contexts and showcase cultural diversity before and after colonial settlement. In addition to a long-term perspective, a unifying theme for each case study is expanding the spatial dimensions of these interactions. To this end, we address social innovations and diverse consequences of culture contact and colonialism both at and away from loci of encounter.

When the diet protein source is controlled, animals eating C3 protein fall on a line parallel to and separate from animals eating C4 protein. Comparing human data to these patterns identifies human diet protein. In contrast, new data for free-ranging animals do not compare favorably with these patterns and we discuss the implications of these findings for reconstructing human diet.

Schofield, John [254] The persistence of place, beyond preservation It is an interesting contradiction that archaeologists who once led the way in promoting preservation of cultural heritage are now developing ways of managing change`, ways that enable the persistence of place (its form or character) without necessarily resorting to formal means of heritage protection. This is a comparatively recent change, corresponding to a perceived decline in state authority, at least in the UK and arguably across larger parts of the developed world. This contribution will assess these new approaches and consider what they tell us about contemporary society and the heritage sector in particular. Schollmeyer, Karen (Simon Fraser University/Arizona State University) and Jonathan C.

Most assemblages from prehistoric villages in this region are dominated by lagomorphs and sciurids, with relatively few artiodactyls. However, some sites and geographic areas show greater artiodactyl relative abundance. We examine factors influencing this variability, including the effects of human population size, settlement patterns, and the locations of less heavily hunted reserve areas. We relate the results to conservation biology studies on the effects of source-sink dynamics on the long term sustainability of large versus small mammal hunting.

Comparing assemblage distributions of wear within an image referenced GIS is one method for estimating the probability of assemblage patterns resulting from behavioral and taphonomic processes. Here I compare the frequency and distribution of edge damage from two MSA assemblages of lithic points from South Africa. Patterns referable to use as cutting tools rather than a taphonomic origin seems to predominant. Bringing tool wear observations into a uniform spatial structure is one avenue for standardization of lithic use-wear analysis.

Burial attributes, radiocarbon dating, stable isotope analyses and electron spin resonance are all used to place a poorly understood cremation feature located between mounds 6 and 7 at the Yokem site within the regional temporal and cultural contexts.

In this paper, I explore our ability to recognize difference within gender categories through an analysis of men and male

roles in early medieval Ireland (c. AD 400-1200). Integrating the human skeletal data with the historical, archaeological, and iconographic evidence reveals the influence of age, status, and other social categories on masculine identity. A bioarchaeological approach thus allows discussion of multiple masculinities in early Irish society.

This paper is intended to explore issues forensic archaeologists encounter with families and communities during and after a casualty has occurred. It will address whether it is necessary and part of forensic archaeologies responsibility to act as facilitators or contributors in the healing and/or closure process to the living.

Assyriologists have examined the development of the numerical systems and proto-writing,` while Art Historians and Archaeologists examine the meaning and function of seal imagery. This paper analyzes Uruk seal imagery in conjunction with numerical and proto-writing` technologies to reveal the interconnectedness of seal and inscription as a larger accounting system.

This paper traces the emergence of designs and motifs among earlier ceramic traditions, such as Mimbres and Ancestral Puebloan, and their later appearance on Salado and Casas Grandes pottery. I use design analysis to explore the spread of styles and symbols throughout time and space and show how these methods contribute to interpretations of interregional interaction and cultural continuity.

Molecular and paleoethnobotanical analyses demonstrated consistency in maize use throughout the Formative period at San Estevan, Belize. This work suggests that agricultural practices were largely unchanged by the emergence of sociopolitical complexity during the Late Formative period. Local hydrological conditions likely facilitated a consistent and decentralized agricultural system. Comparison of these findings to work in other areas of Mesoamerica shows that a variety of agricultural strategies were used to accommodate local environments. This diversity affected developmental trajectories of different sites and areas. [157] Second Organizer [157] Second Chair Seldin, Abigail (University of Oxford) [196] Open Doors: A Retrospective on the R.S. Peabody Museum of Archaeology As a student at Phillips Andover, my experiences at the Peabody Museum both crystallized my passion for anthropology and launched my academic career. Equipped with a foundation in archaeology and hands-on curatorial experience, I began co-curating an exhibition at the University of Pennsylvania Museum as an undergraduate. Now a three-year gallery exhibition, Fulfilling a Prophecy is the first show at the Museum to be co-curated by Native individuals. This work provided the basis for my successful Rhodes scholarship application and acceptance to Oxford`s doctoral program. My paper will address the preparation I received at the Peabody for subsequent work. Sellen, Adam (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México) [51] Murky Waters. Revisiting the Looting of the Sacred Cenote of Chichén Itzá, Yucatán The U.S. Consul Edward H. Thompson`s looting of the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza between 1904 and 1911 is well known to Mesoamerican scholars. Although its story has been told from many perspectives ­including Thompson`s own unapologetic imperialism and the understandable resentment of Mexicans outraged at the looting of their archaeological heritage­its outlines are widely accepted. Using archival sources, my study takes a fresh look at the case and analyzes the role of the Mexican government in the loss of the artifacts. I also provide new evidence for a long-standing question: Who owns Chichen Itza? Semon, Anna (University of North Carolina) [187] Exploring Late Prehistoric Vessel Assemblages in the Coastal Southeastern US Ceramic vessel assemblages are best characterized by studying whole pots. But what happens when there are no whole pots to analyze? Rim sherds offer the next best dataset to assess vessel assemblages. By measuring partial orifice diameters and rim shapes we obtain information about vessel size and form. This paper

presents recent analysis of Late Prehistoric rim sherds, which characterize the Irene Period vessel assemblage from St. Catherines Island, Georgia. These results are compared with other Late Prehistoric coastal vessel assemblages and indicate few vessel forms, but a variety of sizes. Senn, Matthew (The Ohio State University) [13] Early-Middle Holocene Political Economies on the Margins: Incense Kingdom Formation among Nomads in Southern Arabia Factors driving political economy formation are often assumed in models of emerging states, but cannot be accepted as implicit without rigorous testing on a variety of data sets. Mobility requires substantial consideration. This paper applies surface analysis in a Geographic Information System to a prevailing model of primary state formation with site data from Yemen and Oman. Nomads present a challenge to archaeologists, confounding attempts to describe and compare economic activities of societies characterized by high residential mobility. Nomads also present a challenge to rulers of emergent states experimenting with newer and more complex methods of administrative control. Serafin, Stanley (Macquarie University) and Carlos Peraza Lope (Centro INAH - Yucatan) [56] Bioarchaeological Insights into the Population Structure of Mayapan This study integrates analysis of heritable dental metric traits and archaeological context to reconstruct the population structure of the Postclassic regional Maya capital of Mayapan. The hypothesized existence of a cosmopolitan society composed of biologically distinct social groups is evaluated through assessment of odontometric variation at the site, subgroup, and individual levels of analysis. Comparison is made to previous attempts to identify ethnohistorically known social groups based on architectural, artifactual and mortuary patterns. Implications of the present findings for reconstructions of Postclassic transformations of Maya society are discussed.

The site preserves intact burials with grave goods and well preserved faunal and material culture remains. Ninety absolute dates distinguish two successive occupation phases. Both produced pottery and were culturally distinct in terms of subsistence strategies, stone resource acquisition, tool production and consumption, and mortuary practices. Human population continuity across a severe arid episode is possible, although a more diverse community of peoples lived there during the mid Holocene.

Sergheraert, Maelle (ASU) [58] Architectural style evolution: Calixtlahuaca`s monumental structures through ages. Prior to Mexica conquest in 1478, Calixtlahuaca was known as Matlatzinco, a powerful regional capital in the Toluca valley of Mexico. This paper will examine the architectural evolution of the site`s monumental structures through time, highlighting the existence of four construction stages. Then, I will ask the question of continuities and changes in Calixtlahuaca`s architectural style after Aztec Imperial conquest. Serra Puche, Mari Carmen (IIA-UNAM) [21] Archaeological Otomi TLAXCALA The archaeological evidence founded in excavations of housing units-Cacaxtla Xochitécatl make us believe in the possibility that their inhabitants were Otomi. The use of agave for the production of mezcal, residential construction and weaving, as well as female figurines with embroidered clothing similar reasons to those currently used by Otomi women are archaeological indicators of this ethnic affiliation. The study of ethnohistory that mention the presence of Otomi groups in Tlaxcala and ethnoarchaeological work we are doing in some communities of speakers of Otomi help strengthen the hypothesis of ethnic identity-Cacaxtla Xochitécatl [21] Second Organizer Seymour, Elizabeth [177] see Jones, Emily Lena Shackley, M.

With this database, a number of archaeological problems come to the fore including social and gender organization among the Preclassic Hohokam, large scale Paleoarchaic procurement range reconstruction, understanding of Late Classic period migration and territoriality, and significant secondary deposit studies. This paper will be a summary of 30 years of geological and archaeological work on obsidian in the Southwest, and where we might go from here. Shackley, Steven [52] see Clark, Jeffery J.

The survey areas were located in the Caddo River Valley and the Loess Hills and North Central Hills of the Upper Yazoo Basin. We identified 31 archaeological sites that were not previously known, including a significant multi-component prehistoric midden near the Yocuna River. The project

also included a large scale diet-based archaeological predictive model for the entire Vicksburg District. Shakour, Katherine [162] Perspectives On Community Identity: The Slate Quarries Peoples and Archaeology Heritage This project investigates archaeology heritage in the Slate Quarries region of Ireland. It examines the topics of heritage at different levels, meaning and its construction, and local perception of archaeology. This project explores archaeology as an heirloom for the people in the region and the dynamic nature of meanings, associated with archaeology. It explores the factors that contribute to site significance while delving into the multiscalar nature of meaning, memory, and community identity for a unique area in Ireland. The goal is to understand how this particular community, given the individuality of the history and archaeology, relates to their archaeology.

Geomorphic and archaeological data from three recently identified sites on the delta can be used to study site formation and subsistence strategies that focused on littoral resources within a fluid settlement system that included short-term and long-term residential bases and specialized seasonal sites. The history of deltaic progradation, non-seismic deltaic subsidence, and tectonic subsidence provides chronologic limitations for occupation, expectations for land use, and is a useful tool for interpreting archaeological sites in similar environments.

Sharratt, Nicola (University of Illinois-Chicago) [39] Tiwanaku state fragmentation and domestic practice; collapse phase households in the Moquegua Valley, Peru During the collapse of the Tiwanaku state ca. AD 1000, populations in the Moquegua Valley abandoned colonial enclaves in the middle valley and established small, nucleated villages on the coast and in the upper valley. Existing funerary evidence indicates that post-collapse communities adhered to ancestral Tiwanaku rituals. This paper examines the impact of political fragmentation on daily life. Comparison of recently excavated household data from the upper valley with other collapse phase villages, as well as state period sites, suggest that although domestic practices were rooted in earlier customs, different diaspora populations responded to collapse in particular ways. Shaw, Justine (College of the Redwoods) and Johan Normark [67] Settlement dispersion as a strategy to cope with recurrent droughts A fluctuating settlement pattern in the Cochuah region in the Northern Maya Lowlands indicates a possible longterm strategy to deal with recurrent droughts. Settlement aggregation near permanent water sources occurred during periods with few droughts (the Classic period). Dispersion of settlement occurred during periods with droughts, most notably during the Terminal Classic period. This pattern differs from the Colonial period when such dispersion did not take place locally, probably due to the Spanish reducción program. This suggests that a Prehispanic organizational strategy to cope with recurrent droughts existed and that the Spanish presence discouraged the use of this strategy. Shea, John (Stony Brook University) [22] What Difference does 1.3 Million Years Make? Lithic Evidence for Behavioral Variability in the Jordan Valley Paleolithic archaeologists are increasingly trying to adopt explanatory models from behavioral and evolutionary ecology. In "retooling" lithic analysis for this task, we have to start thinking about the elementary costs and benefits involved in knapped stone technology. This paper compares cost/benefit variation in flake production strategies at two open-air sites in the Jordan Valley dating 1.3 million years apart from one another. Ubeidiya is an Lower Paleolithic site in Israel at which remains of Homo erectus/ergaster have been recovered. Ar Rasfa is a Middle Paleolithic site in Jordan attributable to either Homo neanderthalensis or early Homo sapiens. Sheets, Payson (University of Colorado) [8] Seeking Durable Indicators of Manioc Processing: Obsidian Cutting Edges Analyses of sediments from the known manioc beds have produced few microbotanical indicators of manioc. An obsidian blade from a probable harvest processing area sustained an unusual frosted usewear from massive accumulation of linear striations parallel to the edge. Of all the usewear types in Lewenstein`s replicative

study (1987), it is closest to her cutting of manioc husks (cortex). The planting bed soils at Ceren have small amounts of minerals that could cause striations. The results of an experimental study subjecting replicated obsidian edges to cutting manioc cortex with small amounts of that soil are reported here. [119] Discussant Shelton, China [111] see White, Chantel Shelton, Rebecca (AR Consultants, Inc.) and Gabriel Wrobel (University of Mississippi) [204] Investigation of looted contexts at the Sapodilla Rockshelter, Caves Branch Valley, Belize As part of an ongoing regional research project, salvage operations at Sapodilla Rockshelter focused on identifying indicators of the site`s us e. Ceramic analysis of mortuary vessels and thin deposits of isolated sherds suggests that most activity occurred in the Protoclassic and Early Classic periods. Osteological analysis of disturbed human remains indicated a pattern similar to the nearby Caves Branch Rockshelter of repeated mortuary use in which primary burials were disturbed and scattered by later interments. Furthermore, the initial ceramic, osteological, and lithic analyses have identified differential uses of space within the rockshelter`s dark and light zones. Shen, Chen (Royal Ontario Museum), Xiaoling Zhang (The IVPP, Chinese Academy of Sciences) and Xing Gao (The IVPP, Chinese Academy of Sciences) [22] Middle Pleistocene Lithic Technology at the Zhoukoudian Locality 1 Peking Man site, China: New Insights from Stone Tools Use-Wear Studies The paper reports the results from use-wear study of lithic artifacts excavated previously from the famous Zhoukoudian Locality 1 cave where 40 individuals of Homo erectus fossils were discovered. The new study suggests that that Peking Man lithic technology was not simple as previously thought. The micro-wear evidence indicates many typed tools were made for specific tasks related to processing animal substances. Importantly, most pointed tools were probably hafted, and this provides arguably the earliest evidence for the composition tools in the Chinese Middle Pleistocene. East Asian hominids were not primitive in their use of lithic technology. Shepard, Ben (UCLA) [236] Middle Holocene political economies in the CisBaikal, Russia: insights from mortuary data Studies of social dynamics in intermediate societies emphasize the importance of rituals such as funerals in structuring political economies in which they are embedded. I present results from an investigation of prehistoric political economy in the Cis-Baikal region of Siberia, Russia, based on mortuary data from Serovo (3800-3000 BC) and Glazkovo (3000-2000 BC) cemeteries. I demonstrate several changes in the relationships between demographic variables (age, sex, burial location) and types of treatment individuals received at death (grave architecture, grave goods). I then discuss the implications of changing burial practices for models of local social organization and political economy.

Excavations at Durrington Walls have uncovered a wellpreserved Neolithic settlement with surviving house floors and middens identifiable to particular houses. These present an opportunity for a detailed economic study of the Stonehenge people from household to community. This paper presents preliminary results from pottery residue analysis, which aims to investigate consumption within and between households and ceremonial spaces. It is suggested that contents varied by vessel size, and were deposited differently in public and domestic areas. Shimada, Izumi (Southern Illinois University) and Go Matsumoto (Southern Illinois University) [71] Water, Fire, and Huaca: Rituals of Regeneration and Ancestor Veneration in the Sicán Culture The Cupisnique practice of setting an intentional fire at the time of interment of the deceased and temples continued into the later Sicán period in the Lambayeque region of the north coast. We documented numerous episodes of extensive but ephemeral fire setting immediately after the deposition of each new alluvial layer around the Huaca Loro temple mound. These fires spanned 1000-1533 CE. Offerings of ceramics, ingots, textiles and even a whole puma were placed where water would have cascaded down the temple mound. We argue that these activities expressed ancestor veneration and interrelated concepts of transformation and regeneration. [267] Discussant Shimada, Izumi [156] see Klaus, Haagen D.

Shock, Myrtle [129] Paleoethnobotanical study of central Brazilian rockshelters, 500 to 8000 BP. Analysis of plant remains from two rock shelters on the Brazilian savanna provides the context for discussing chronological shifts in plant resource utilization.

General patterns observed in measures of plant density and richness by strata were further assessed with ANOVA and chi-squared tests to distinguish the statistically significant patterns. Interpretations of chronological changes are based upon to the archaeological context and plant remains found therein. [129] First Chair Shockey, Paul (Arizona State University) [36] Having the Choice: Thermal Resistance and PIXE Analyses of Woodland Period Ceramics This study is an examination of ceramic choices at the Mound House Site (11GE7), Greene County, Illinois. The use of crushed limestone as a tempering agent is largely limited to the Lower Illinois Valley during the Middle Woodland Period (ca. 50 cal B.C. ­ cal A.D. 400). To determine whether this choice was based on raw material availability or culinary utility, thermal resistance was tested on limestone- and non-limestone-tempered ceramic sherds. Additionally, Proton Induced X-Ray Emission analysis compares the elemental variability of ceremonial wares (Hopewell and Baehr) with utility wares (Havana and Pike) to infer local or extralocal origin. Sholts, Sabrina (University of California, Berkeley) [146] Three-dimensional modeling of the human skull: An outline-based analysis of prehistoric cranial morphology on the northern Channel Islands of California In this study, three-dimensional (3D) digital models were used to analyze morphological variation among human crania from archaeological sites on the northern California Channel Islands. Three different outlines were produced from cross-sectional geometry planes defined by standard craniometric landmarks in the midfacial, palatal, and vault components of each 3D model, and coordinate points along the outlines were transformed with elliptic Fourier analysis. Multivariate statistical analysis of the Fourier coefficients revealed two distinct patterns of midfacial and palatal morphology in the overall sample, consistent with osteological, archaeological, and linguistic evidence suggesting that more than one population may have colonized this region.

A View from the port of Xcambó, Yucatan, Mexico During the Classic, the coastal enclave of Xcambó functioned as a salt production center and port, maintaining long-reaching ties with other parts of the Maya world and with Veracruz. In this paper, we explore Xcambo´s shifting exchange networks, using settlement, architectural and ceramic evidence. This information is complemented with direct insights on its settlers. From Xcambo´s mortuary record, we reconstruct their biological profile, geographic provenience and artificial head shapes. Considered jointly, the bioarchaeological evidence traces cultural affiliations and the geographic mobility of Xcambó`s merchants and provides new insights as to the settlement`s swift abandonment shortly after 700 DC.

[89] Pre-Neolithic Mediterranean Seafarers: the Evidence from Cyprus New studies over the past several years demonstrate that, contrary to conventional wisdom, the earliest occupants of at least some of the Mediterranean islands were pre-Neolithic peoples with considerable seafaring skills. This was clearly demonstrated in Cyprus at Akrotiri Aetokremnos (ca. 12,000 BP), which also is suggestive a human role in the extinction of endemic pygmy hippopotami. This paper presents results of reexcavation at Aetokremnos and the testing of possibly contemporary near-by sites. It concludes with a summary of claimed pre-Neolithic sites, including recent claims of great antiquity in Crete, and some of the issues involved in firmly documenting these.

This paper synthesizes architectural, artifactual, and botanical data to explore an elite Terminal Classic household and the activities performed therein. A relatively rapid abandonment and lack of post-abandonment disturbance afford extraordinary contexts with abundant de facto refuse from both indoor and outdoor spaces. Ongoing, microscale analyses of these remains reveal the material patterns of daily life. [221] see Parker, Evan A.

Many of these have little or no historical information. They can best be understood through a combination of this limited historical data, analogy, and their spatial and temporal distributions. Although I initially suspected an imperial-style expansion, a more likely explanation may be the desire of the nobility to build in the 'courtly style' in locations under their control reflecting social aspirations and tensions that link politics, social values, and material culture to geography and state evolution.

Snakes are a key to the design and selection of material for tool kits in Plains settings and birds in mountain settings. Scales and feathers are elements incorporating snake forms that have perished. A central place is Meso America where the feathered serpent joins these elements in symbolism

This paper discusses the material landscape of homelessness, attempting to establish connections between homelessness and the greater economic and political networks in which it functions. Expertise in material culture, the construction and presentation of unpopular narratives, and the process of historic preservation are unique contributions and strengths that archaeologists can utilize to effect change in contemporary power relationships, which can aid in creation or transformation of activist politics. Singleton, Theresa (Syracuse University) [121] [Paradise or Hell? Archaeological implications for Contrasting Views of Cuban Coffee Landscapes Archaeological studies of plantations have more often emphasized the creation rather than the consumption of landscapes. Cuban coffee planters designed their plantations to facilitate coffee production and to control slave movement, but also to establish showplaces. Many Cuban coffee plantations became world renown for their beautiful gardens, tree-lined avenues, and commanding vistas of the surrounding area. This paper examines archaeological insights gained from the study of two contrasting audiences or consumers of these landscapes-- enslaved laborers and foreign visitors --for locating, identifying, and interpreting plantation spaces at the coffee plantation Santa Ana de Biajacas.

The ages of these sites would be expected to exceed the limits of 14C dating. Therefore several shells, sp. Acatina, were selected for ESR dating. The one from Mlambalasi gave an age within the Holocene and therefore suggests reworking within the site. From Magubike, a sample collected above the level where hominin teeth were found dated to ~150 ka. One from the lower level was saturated and therefore could not be dated. Further samples should be tested to investigate the possibility of reworking in this site.

Slater, Philip (University of Illinois UrbanaChampaign) [74] Results of Experimental Obsidian Microwear Analyses using a Scanning Electron Microscope Traditional lithic microwear studies use light microscopy to determine chert and flint artifact functions. Applying this technique to obsidian is problematic because light reflects off its glassy surface hindering observation. Because obsidian is too reflective for light microscopy and its brittleness generates different damage patterns than flint and chert, it requires a different set of analytical methods. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) negates light reflection and permits clear, high magnification imaging of edge damage. I will present results of experiments showing that use-actions on several materials can produce diagnostic usewear patterns on obsidian artifacts that are observable with a SEM.

This poster documents the historical use of this facility and provides an example of regional World War II era archaeology on the Lower Colorado River. Slessman, Scott [215] Discussant Sload, Rebecca [266] The Case for Specialized Activity Areas in the Cave under the Pyramid of the Sun, Teotihuacan This paper continues reporting on analysis of the 1978 Teotihuacan Mapping Project test excavations in the cave under the Pyramid of the Sun. Prior analysis showed that the vast majority of ceramics consist of only three forms, virtually all utilitarian. A more thorough analysis that includes context, radiocarbon dates, and non-ceramic artifacts indicates the presence of different activity areas, ritual in nature, as would be expected based on the location of the cave. Hypothesized activities and their implications are explored, including the important one that counters historical conclusions about cave assemblages indicating habitation when they consist of utilitarian items.

This paper presents a public campaign methodology adopted for the conservation of rock art on the Burrup Peninsula (Murujuga) in Western Australia, which is home to more than a million panels of rock art and is one of the world`s most significant cultural heritage precincts. The Stand Up for the Burrup` campaign seeks to draw attention to the archaeological record and to urge its protection from industrial development. We will discuss how Traditional Owners; archaeologists; politicians and the public, can work together for heritage conservation and suggest the methodology can be applied for conservation of significant cultural heritage precincts in the Americas.

Perspectives on Technology, Chronology, and Adaptations. The earliest Clovis archaeological sites were discovered in the Plains and the West. These early finds have shaped our understanding of the cultural complex and established standards for Clovis technology, chronology and adaptations. The addition of new sites helps reaffirm some universal characteristics, but also highlights nuances of variation within Clovis. This variation raises the question, what is Clovis, and the papers in this symposium provide the most current evidence of Clovis technology, chronology, and adaptations.

During the Colonial era, the ore became a significant source of raw iron in New England. Rich in titanium, cumberlandite presents a unique opportunity to source excavated ore samples, byproducts, and artifacts. Using both XRF and SEM-EDS analyses, we have established a basic fingerprint of cumberlandite to analyze a set of samples from two early iron manufacturing sites in Rhode Island. Due to the singular concentration of the ore in Cumberland, these analyses may highlight patterns of iron distribution within Rhode Island, and with future application, throughout New England. Smith, Alexia (University of Connecticut) [111] The Use of Multivariate Statistics within Archaeobotany Over the past decade, the use of multivariate statistics to examine archaeobotanical data has become more commonplace, enabling a rigorous approach to data exploration. This paper reviews the use of multivariate statistics within archaeobotany to examine questions at both the site and regional level. It concludes with a discussion of the potential for correspondence analysis to integrate archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological data in order to examine ancient food production in a more quantitative and holistic manner. [45] Discussant Smith, Beth (Nevada Department of Transportation) [6] Great Basin and California Crescents: Determining Function Through the Manufacturing Continuum Crescents are usually found in pre-Archaic lithic assemblages in the Great Basin and California, but understanding of their function has been limited by a lack of stratified contexts and definitive use-wear results. Through the examination of their manufacturing processes, sourcing data and of Great Basin geography, a better understanding as to what conditions (time, location, and subsistence strategies) favored the use of crescents can also provide clues as to their eventual disappearance from the early hunter-gatherer`s toolkit.

A series of general categories of human niche construction involving wild components of biotic communities are briefly described, and the difficulties encountered in recognizing them in the archaeological record are considered.

[168] Persistent Use of the Landscape and the MidHolocene Housepits of Wyoming The stability of mobility patterns as reflected by the persistent landscape use in a redundant manner over decades and centuries is an important dimension of hunter-gatherer residential mobility strategies that is typically not considered. Investigating mobility patterns over the long term contributes to the understanding of the complexities of hunter-gatherer settlement systems. The mid-Holocene Wyoming housepit dataset provides an opportunity to explore these long term stable mobility patterns, exemplifying the usefulness of archaeological data in delineating persistent landscape use. The Wyoming housepit dataset evidences persistent landscape use over at least two thousand years at three scales of spatial congruence. Smith, Donna (Indiana University of Pennsylvania) [65] Comparing the Effectiveness of Ground Penetrating Radar in Identifying Stockade Features in Late Prehistoric and Historic Sites The proposed poster presentation will focus on a study of the effectiveness of Ground Penetrating Radar in locating stockade features in late prehistoric and historic archaeological sites. The use of GPR in identifying features is becoming more popular in the archaeological community, yet its ability to identify late prehistoric features may be questionable. The research will include GPR surveys and ground-truthing of two sites ­ Ft. Shirley in Shirleysburg, Pennsylvania and Mary Rinn in Indiana, Pennsylvania. The research will include a GPR survey, ground-truthing of anomalies suspected to be stockade features, and an analysis of the effectiveness of the GPR survey.

Although work there revealed a rich record of human occupation including a substantial Paleoindian component dating to as early as 10,300 14C B.P., materials from the site were never fully analyzed. In this paper, we present the results of our technological and source provenance analyses of stemmed points and bifaces from the Paleoindian component at Last Supper Cave and compare them to the results of similar analyses of the bifaces from the Parman Localities, a series of nearby open-air Paleoindian sites.

With use of geometric morphometrics, the entire geometry of the artifacts is preserved throughout analysis, providing a more robust statistical expression of shape for use in comparative morphological explorations than standard morphometric variables. Our analysis expands a previous investigation of major factors of variability in Clovis point shape in North America to include specimens representing the American Southeast with a specific objective of addressing patterns of geographic variability.

We use Bayesian spatial smoothing and correspondence analysis of chronogically sensitive

ceramic type frequencies in plowzone quadrats to separate synchronic differences from patterns of change among households. Comparing the results with variation among assemblages from subsurface features and variation in the features themselves yields new insights into change in storage and costly signaling practices. Smith, Kevin (Haffenreffer Museum, Brown University), Michele Smith (Haffenreffer Museum, Brown University) and Thomas Urban (Brown University) [42] Deep in the Glaciermen`s Domain: archaeological investigations by the Haffenreffer Museum at Gilsbakki, western Iceland, 2008-2010 The site of Gilsbakki was, according to documentary records, the seat of a Viking Age chieftainship, a medieval ecclesiastic estate, and an early modern parish center. By another reading, Gilsbakki`s history reflects a thousand year struggle for dominance with a rival elite center at Reykholt, 15 km away. Excavations, geophysical prospection, and collections analyses by Brown University researchers from 2008-2010, documented a 2.4 meter deep, stratified, artifact-rich record at Gilsbakki suggesting complementary, material narratives about early medieval elite power, changing responses to six centuries of colonial rule, and the emergence of modernity in the 18th century North Atlantic. Smith, Michael (Arizona State University) [214] Can Archaeological Blogs be used for Serious Scholarship? Most archaeological blogs are aimed at the dissemination of information to a non-professional audience, with a few blogs focused on communication of professional information among archaeologists. I explore the possibilities for expanding blogging beyond a teaching-service-entertainment orientation into a more serious intellectual realm. Why are there no archaeological blogs for serious intellectual conversation (like the anthropology blog, Savage Minds). Might archaeological blogs be used for the production of intellectual content through collaboration among professionals? I discuss some of the roadblocks and potential benefits to expanding archaeological blogging in the direction of intellectual and scientific production.

Smith, Scott (Franklin & Marshall College) [93] Ceremonialism and the Social Relations of Production during the Late Formative Period (200 BC ­ AD 500) in the Southern Lake Titicaca Basin, Bolivia The Late Formative was a dynamic time in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin. A series of multi-community polities are argued to have controlled the region, although the precise organization and influence of these polities remains poorly understood. In this paper I trace the history of one multi-community polity centered at Khonkho Wankane in the Desagüadero Valley. In particular, I consider how ceremony and belief articulated with the social relationships surrounding economic production. I conclude by hypothesizing ways in which ceremony and ideology were manipulated to underwrite the political and economic centralization of the nearby Tiwanaku state around AD 500. Smith, Stuart (UC Santa Barbara) and Michele Buzon (Purdue University) [152] Identity, Commemoration and Remembrance in Colonial Encounters: Burials at Tombos during the Egyptian New Kingdom Nubian empire and its aftermath. Commemoration of individuals through burial provides a critical arena for the negotiation of identities in colonial encounters. Burials at Tombos, an Egyptian colonial community in Sudanese Nubia founded in c. 1400 BC, reflect remembrances that vary by sex, class and chronology. While most individuals commemorated their Egyptian identities, some women at Tombos identified as Nubians in their burials. In addition, various types of burials reveal social class differences. They also reflect the cultural entanglements common to colonial encounters that blended elements of both cultures and eventually led to the emergence of a new, hybrid identity in the empires aftermath.

Recent Museum of Northern Arizona excavations are the first to integrate systematic studies of both micro and macro botanical remains from multiple archaeological sites along the Colorado River. Here we summarize pollen and flotation records from Pueblo period residential sites in the eastern Grand Canyon. Results show that by ca. 1000 AD, Grand Canyon farmers grew maize, cotton, and squash. In addition, they harvested wild plant resources including mesquite, cacti, and grasses. Charcoal from thermal features represent a variety of local and higher elevation woods, some probably harvested as driftwood. Smits, Nicholas (AINW, Inc) [160] A View from Craig Mountain: New Perspectives on

the Stockhoff Basalt Quarry in Northeastern Oregon The Stockhoff Basalt Quarry (35UN52), one of the largest and best-known archaeological sites in Oregon, encompasses over 3,400 acres of Craig Mountain in the northeastern part of the state. Native people have quarried fine-grained volcanic material from this area for thousands of years. Recent surveys resulted in the identification of numerous artifact concentrations at 35UN52 and the recordation of more than 230 additional pre-contact archaeological resources -- including lithic scatter sites, rock features, quarry sites, and isolated finds--in adjacent areas of Craig Mountain. This paper investigates the relationships among these newly recorded sites, the Stockhoff Basalt Quarry, and local geology.

A.D. 1315-1450) encompasses Mera's types A through C. Traditionally believed to express chronological relationships based on seriation studies by N. C. Nelson and H. P. Mera, the continued focus on the perceived chronological sequence of these early bowl rim varieties ignores possible reasons underlying variation in bowl rim forms. Here we propose possible factors to account for the appearance of modified bowl rims on early glazeware bowls.

Additional samples from both sites have allowed for investigating whether original difference was due to drift or sampling error. The sites were compared with those from both modern and prehistoric populations in the desert Southwest, including samples from the Mimbres and Casas Grandes (Paquime), to better understand the regional context of the inhabitants, as well as inter-regional relationships. Sobel, Elizabeth (Missouri State University) [160] The Expansion Model of Post-Contact Change in NW Coast Exchange Systems: An Archaeological Test Using Obsidian Evidence from the Lower Columbia River Scholars widely assume that during the early decades of Euroamerican influence on the NW Coast of North America, the volume and geographic scope of longdistance exchange activity increased among Native communities. However, this Exchange Expansion Model (EEM) is based on ethnohistory and remains untested by archaeology. I address this problem with an archaeological test involving pre-contact and postcontact obsidian artifact data from three Lower Columbia River sites - Cathlapotle, Clahclellah, and Meier. Results support the modeled increase in volume, but not the purported increase in geographic scope, in native exchange activity in the wake of Euroamerican arrival in the area.

It is explored through a discussion of the parallels and dissonances between performance art and human osteoarchaeology ­ two disciplines that share a distinctive focus on the interpretive possibilities generated through touching the human skeleton. In particular, osteoarchaeology can be understood as a performance-based experiential research process in which tactile engagement with the skeleton follows a script to (re)create the sex and gender of the human body. Solar Valverde, Laura [237] see Bauer-Clapp, Heidi J. Soler-Arechalde, Ana (UNAM) [92] Burned and Unburned stuccos employed to improve the paleosecular variation of the geomagnetic field since Prehispanic times The first secular variation curve of Mesoamerica from AD 1 to 1200 was done by Wolfman(1990) with burned stuccos. The inclusion of ground volcanic scoria in Central Mexico stuccos allowed us to propose the hypothesis of unburned stuccos made with scoria could record the magnetic signal, many of the dates obtained from them were corroborated with radiocarbon dates. Since 1999 we have been intensively working and numerous 14C data become available from Central Mexico improving the stratigraphy and chronology. In light of these new radiometric and magnetic data we present an updated secular variation curve for the last two millenniums.

It seems commonplace to assume that these sorts of relationships have a long history. The first plaza-oriented pueblos in Salinas have been interpreted as potential fortresses, their upland locations affording defense and panoramic views of enemy territory to the east. Recent excavations at early Salinas pueblos complicate this interpretation. Architecture, evidence of burning, and settlement patterning point also to a concern with enemies to the west, where population movements coincide with aggregation in the Rio Abajo.

Our results are compared to previously generated data from the earlier Huaracane, succeeding Tumilaca and Chiribaya populations, and to highland Tiwanaku data to assess dietary changes in relation to political and demographic changes across the Tiwanaku core and peripheral regions.

Feathers have great symbolic significance to many modern native groups, and so may afford archaeologists an exceptional view into the past. Analysis of feather bundles and feathered artifacts from the cave should assist in determining ethnicity. Moreover, this inquiry will explore agency of feathers and the symbolism of birds and feathers for modern Puebloan and Great Basin groups. Sorensen, Tim Flohr (University of Cambridge)

[226] A Sort of Homecoming: On the Role of Returning in Secondary Burials The act of returning remains an understudied yet important part of secondary burials. In seeking to explore the role of returning, the paper focuses on the social movements that circumscribe ashes, bones, urns, funerary pyres, crematoria and burial places. It compares contemporary cremation and cremation in the Early Bronze Age of Denmark, addressing the social and emotional impact of going back to the cremated remains. It is argued that acts of returning revolve around parting with the dead in a physically recognizable form. The paper introduces the concept of vagueness as a subtext and objective of secondary burials. Soto, Gabriella (University of Bristol) [124] The Undocumented Landscape: Transience and Subsistence at the Border Every year, thousands of undocumented immigrants enter the United States by crossing its southwestern land border. This region has become a contested landscape, created by the transit of anonymous human beings, and the material traces of their clandestine and ephemeral presence. Backpacks, water bottles and clothing are the markers of what in effect is a horizontal stratigraphy of a contemporary archaeological record. An interdisciplinary approach to landscape formation in contested space is adopted here, and aims to investigate the social, economic, and emotional dimensions of such activities.

Spencer, Kaylee (University of Wisconsin - River Falls) [102] Locating Palenque`s Portraits: Space, Spectatorship, and Identity in Classic Maya Art This study examines the portrayal of personal identity in relation to space within Classic Maya sculptural programs. Using the rich corpus of Classic-period portraits from Palenque, and nearby sites, I consider how relationships between viewers and subjects inform the messages encoded in ancient artifacts. I suggest, drawing from archaeological evidence, iconography, and new readings of hieroglyphic texts, that artists fashioned highly prescribed viewing contexts, which endowed artworks with greater significance and power than western models allow. I propose that (re)inserting viewers into pictorial programs encourages a richer understanding of Maya art and opens arenas to discuss emic notions of space.

Spengler, Robert (Washington University in St. Louis) [54] Paleoethnobotanical Studies in Eastern Kazakhstan: the Bronze and Iron Age Interface The cultural dynamics and economies that underpin the

development of Eurasian societies of the steppe are thought to have undergone significant changes at the start of the Iron Age (ca.800 B.C.). An increase in size and quantity of burial mounds and occupation sites are argued to be indicators of a transition. I discuss paleoethnobotanical data from the pivotal time period of the early Iron Age, looking at three archaeological sites in Semirech`ye, Kazakhstan (Tuzusai, Begash, and Mukri). While agricultural products were used in the region during the Middle Bronze Age, agriculture was not a major economic pursuit until the Iron Age. Spengler, Robert [111] see D'Alpoim Guedes, Jade Spielmann, Katherine (Arizona State University) [53] Forager-Farmer Interaction in North America The relationship between foragers and farmers is a complex topic in North American prehistory because there were no populations that relied solely on domesticated plants and animals for their subsistence. Documenting prehistoric forager-farmer interaction is also complicated by the archaeological invisibility of many of the trade items. The Plains-Pueblo interactive system, on which John Speth has worked, remains the best documented of all the prehistoric forager-farmer systems in North America. Using this example as well as the Crow-Hidatsa and Iroquois-Algonquian systems, this paper discusses two pathways to forager-farmer relations: farmers interacting with ethnically distinct hunter-gatherers, and farmers becoming foragers.

These objects were part of a system of communication that established group identity during a time of political upheaval. Requiring literacy of several visual systems, the Huaca del Loro ceramics are, in themselves, a middle ground.

Considering human-built environment relationships, we link spatial analysis and resource procurement studies to insights gained from regional ethnographic sources and local Indigenous knowledge to examine connections between the constructed landscapes of the Northern Coast Salish. Our analyses allow us to infer settlement patterning and resource use over time and across space, revealing wider socioeconomic links but also highlighting the distinctive nature of Northern Coast Salish archaeological signatures. Springer, Corinne (Utah Museum of Natural History) and Ann Kelsey (Utah Museum of Natural History) [91] Smoke Signals: Smoke Signals: The positive effects of fire on the germination and growth of Nicotiana attenuata (coyote tobacco). Nicotiana attenuata is a post fire annual whose use by indigenous populations is documented ethnographically. This study, prompted by a two-hundred acre wildfire shortly after the recovery of a prehistorically cached bundle of tobacco, tracks the sort-lived florescence of the species and its distribution and density in the burned area for three years. Sharp declines in germination after the first growing season illustrate the necessity of frequent fire episodes. Dense patches associated with prehistoric features and possible farm plots are indicative of active encouragement of the species and possibly cultivation during the Fremont Period. Sprowles, Michael (Indiana University of Pennsylvania) [65] Magnetometry and Electrical Resistivity surveys of the Allegheny Portage Railroad Some of the more recent technological advances in archaeology may be employed to better understand the history of the Allegheny Portage Railroad. By examining the engine house at the head of plane 9 with a combined approach utilizing Magnetometry, Electrical Resistivity, and mild ground-truthing a clear picture of its unique shape, boundaries, and preservation can be obtained, while causing minimal impact to the archaeological record. In addition, usage of these two specific geophysical technologies will allow for comparison and assessment of general effectiveness in the soils of the Allegheny Mountains. Spry-Marques, Victoria (University of Cambridge) [205] Zooarchaeology and Seasonality throughout the Late Upper Palaeolithic: The Case of Vela Spila (Croatia) Determining season of occupation at Late Upper Palaeolithic sites is key for understanding settlement patterns at times of fluctuating climatic and

environmental conditions. This deepens our knowledge of hunting strategies as it is a well-established fact that humans' movements were in sync with animal populations' migrations. The Epigravettian site of Vela Spila in southern Croatia is used as an example of how zooarchaeology has the potential to address questions on seasonality in an innovative way, and how this information can subsequently be used to understand when and where people were moving to (or not!) at different times of year. Spurr, Kimberly (Museum of Northern Arizona) and Ted Neff (Museum of Northern Arizona) [20] The Big Picture: An Introduction to Recent Archaeological and Geomorphic Research along the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon This paper will present a brief overview of recent archaeological and geomorphic research along the Colorado River corridor in the Grand Canyon, undertaken for both compliance and research purposes, and will introduce the symposium papers. We will offer a spatial orientation for the investigated sites and a brief history of the projects. We will also describe chronology and archaeological background pertinent to the symposium. The presentation will conclude with an introduction of the symposium paper topics and their collective contribution to cultural resource management, substantive archaeological and geomorphic research, public education, and Native American perspectives on the Grand Canyon. Stack, Margaret (University of South Florida) [241] An Archaeological Appraisal of 18th and 19th Century Spanish Indians on the West Coast of Florida Spanish Indian is a generic term that has been used repeatedly in written documents over the past three centuries to describe a range of different social, ethnic, and economic groups in the southeastern United States. In this paper, comparative analysis of the material culture from Cuban fishing ranchos of the 18th and 19th centuries on the west coast of Florida addresses the ways in which specific Spanish Indian collections fit into the archaeological record. The presentation also provides suggestions for how historical archaeologists might contend with difficulties in determining and documenting identity at early historical sites in coastal Florida. Stafford, Thomas [262] see Jenkins, Dennis L. Stahl, Ann (University of Victoria) [198] Surplus production in a time of slavery and political dislocation. A West African case study Questions around surplus production were entertained in earlier literatures on processes of state formation, but they have not figured prominently in recent investigations of West Africa`s historical entanglements with the Atlantic world despite interest in how the slave trade reconfigured relations between societies of varying scale. To reengage questions of surplus, this paper asks questions about how the slave trade and attendant political dislocation affected surplus production. Drawing on comparative data from the last thousand years in the Banda area, Ghana, I explore continuity and change in surplus production in relation to historical shifts in the region`s political economy.

Ethnohistoric information on the cultural and historical significance and the rituals and beliefs surrounding lightning veneration are presented. Natural features, mountains, natural springs, etc., designated as Catequilla` or Catequil` were considered huacas (sacred places) associated with lightning veneration during the Colonial Period. Lightning was worshiped from Quito to Cuzco. Huacas along the equator were important to astronomical calculation. Astronomical function is demonstrated from the geometry of remaining Inca platform foundations. Preliminary survey of indicates extensive Inca presence during the Contact Period. Stanton, Travis (Universidad de las Américas Puebla) [85] Ceramic Ethnoanalysis at Yaxuná, Yucatán Using archaeological ceramics from Yaxuná, Yucatán this paper explores the use of petrography in conjunction with the direct participation of indigenous potters in the analysis of ceramic technology. This approach is termed ethnoanalysis to distinguish it from ethnoarchaeology where potters are observed producing modern ceramics instead of participating in the analysis of ancient ceramics. Stapleton, Charles (Northern Illinois University) and Maria Stapleton (Northern Illinois University) [170] Burning for the Gods: Ceramic Incensarios/Braseros as Indicators of Cultural Continuity and Disjunction in Postclassic Central Mexico Remains of ceramic incense burners and braseros at the Postclassic Central Mexican site of Calixtlahuaca occur in diverse forms and decoration. Some exhibit characteristics that suggest ties with earlier (Teotihuacan; Tula) and contemporary (Aztec) central Mexican ceramic traditions, while others imply the dominance of local/vernacular tradition. Our paper presents a new form-based typology for this largely untapped subset of ritual ceramic vessels which holds the potential to detect technological and aesthetic affinities or differences between cultures. More importantly, this typology provides an indicator of the degree of continuity in regional ritual practice and associated ideological systems. Stapleton, Maria [170] see Stapleton, Charles R. Starkey, Anna (AECOM) [256] [From Bulbs to Bolas - Baked Clay in Prehistoric Sites along the Sacramento River] Previous investigations have treated clay as a common constituent in prehistoric sites along the Sacramento River; however recent analysis has found that a substantial amount of data has been overlooked.

A photographic analysis of over one thousand objects in pursuit of tangible evidence of this deity shows direct relationships in iconography that speak of this personage whose beneficent remembrance adorns not only the art of the ancient Andes, Mesoamerica and Mexico, but that of Adena and Etowah, thereby extending art historic material evidence from southern South America into Mississippian North America.

Many woods and charcoals have been found in archaeological sites in Nunavik (northern Quebec, Canada). In fact, wood resources have had a special importance in the daily life of Paleo and Neo-Eskimos populations (e.g. for houses construction and heating). This study concerns the regions of Ivujivik, Inukjuak and Umiujaq located on the east shore of the Hudson Bay, respectively in the grass, shrub and forest tundra. The aims of the study is to find out the origin of present and fossil woods (driftwoods or local woods) and to document their use and exploitation by humans through dendrochronology, anthracology, geochemistry and ethno-archaeology.

Steele, Julia (Petersburg National Battlefield) [173] Resolution and Scale: The Archaeology of Military Sites Armed conflict occurs on many scales and the archaeological record reflects this continuum. Studies at different levels of resolution are appropriate to answer different questions about military and related sites. This paper will look at recent work at the American Revolutionary War encampment at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, and at features that were part of the Petersburg campaign during the Civil War and examine how methods appropriate to the scale of the resource provide the richest data for analysis and resource management. Steele, Teresa [12] see Texier, Jean-Pierre Steere, Benjamin (University of Georgia) [164] House segmentation and household economy in the native Southeast To better understand how house form varies across space and time in the prehistoric and early historic Southeastern United States, I constructed a database cataloging the architectural features of over 1000 houses from over 60 sites throughout the region. A broad-scale comparison of the houses shows that interior space becomes more segmented or partitioned over time. The division of interior space is far more visible in Late Mississippian houses than in houses from earlier periods. There are many reasons for this pattern, but I argue that it is explained by important changes in the organization of domestic production and consumption. Steeves, Paulette (Binghamton University) [173] Pebbles In A Pond; American Archaeology Needs A Landslide Heritage studies and Cultural Resource Management (CRM) constitute approximately 80 % of North American archaeology fieldwork. The majority of archaeologists employed in American heritage and CRM positions earn their degrees at American universities in programs that provide inadequate training for these positions. A lack of required courses in ethics, American indigenous history/area studies, and CRM contributes to this crisis in training. These inadequacies in Anthropological degree programs whether intentional or unintentional constitute an ontological violence and a continued pedagogy of oppression. Al Dekin`s emphasis on ethical training in heritage studies and CRM provide a model for others to follow. Steffen, Anna [97] see Rogers, Alexander K. Stehman, Kelly (National Park Service) and Lisa Baldwin (National Park Service) [248] Investigating the Historic Navajo Occupation of Wupatki National Monument Little is known about the historic Navajo occupation of the area that is now Wupatki National Monument. Until recently, the1985 pedestrian survey of the monument provided the only information about historic Navajo sites in the monument. During the 2010 field season, Park Archaeologists undertook an intensive documentation and archival research project in an effort to more fully understand the historic component of Wupatki NM. This paper presents the results of this important first step in

documenting the historic Navajo occupation and use of the Wupatki Basin. Steinbach, Penny [102] Reconsidering the Jester God, Part II The Classic Maya Jester God has three distinct variants (avian, anthropomorphic, and piscine) indicative of three distinct realms (celestial, terrestrial, and aquatic, respectively), and when three Jester Gods are arranged triadically, the triad`s arrangement mimics the spatial alignment of the corresponding realm(s). Nonetheless, most Jester Gods are blends of two or more variants -- why? It is my contention that the Jester God embodies not only the axis mundi (Taube 1998) but also embodies--in the blending of its distinct variants --the unity of realms and the unification of multidirectional space that the axis mundi provides. Steinberg, John [42] see Schreiner, Amanda Marie Steinbrenner, Larry (Red Deer College) [183] The Pacific Nicaragua Potting Tradition, AD 8001350 More than eighty years after Lothrop`s watershed Pottery of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, archaeologists working in Greater Nicoya continue to struggle with problems of ceramic taxonomy. Decades of research have led to the identification of a bewildering array of ceramic types, but little discussion of the interrelationships between these types. This paper argues that most of the Sapoá Period polychrome types previously identified in Pacific Nicaragua--including those usually treated as markers of different immigrant Mesoamerican groups --are more alike than unalike, and are best understood as the products of a common potting tradition with a Central American origin. Stelle, Lenville (Parkland College) [60] First Chair Stemp, William (Keene State College) and Steven Chung (Worcester Polytechnic Institute) [59] The Quantification of Use-wear on Obsidian: LSCM and Fractal Analysis Previous work by Evans and Donahue (2008) using a Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope (LSCM) successfully demonstrated the quantitative documentation and discrimination of surfaces on experimental flint flakes used on different contact materials. Our experiments follow in their footsteps by testing the reliability of LSCM to quantitatively document surface roughness on obsidian flakes and discriminate the surfaces of these flakes used on different materials based on their wear histories. The wear patterns on the obsidian flake surfaces were discriminated using areascale fractal analysis and the F-test was applied to determine confidence levels for the discriminations.

Stephenson, Keith (USC Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology) and Adam King (South Carolina Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology) [164] Coastal Plain Chiefdoms of the Middle Savannah River Valley: Labor, History, and Hierarchy Our research focusing on the political economy of mound centers in the middle Savannah River valley has prompted a reevaluation of current interpretations regarding societal complexity. We conclude the clearest expression of classic Mississippian riverine-adaptation is evident at mound centers immediately below the Fall Line with their political ties to Etowah. By contrast, those centers on the interior Coastal Plain were politically autonomous with minimal signatures in social ranking. The scale of appropriated labor and resulting level of surplus production, necessitated by settlement in the Aiken Plateau, fostered social contradictions making communally-oriented and decentralized societies more sustainable than hierarchical forms.

Creating maps of individual sites is essential to analyzing those sites, but since we are investigating highly mobile people, we also need to create maps at broader scales to gain a fuller picture of Paleolithic life. We may not have the benefit of roads or other features of the built environment to aid us, but the creation of maps based on material culture and ideas is possible and can be a useful tool in our understanding of the individual site and of hunter-gatherer life.

High resolution excavation employed at Tse-whit-zen (45CA523) Washington state, isolated short-term cultural events (floor surface formation, construction and dumping events).

The Marsh Creek Site (CA-CCO548) spans this temporal boundary, and when compared to other regional assemblages, provides data important for understanding the character and motivations for these transitions.

Advances in mass spectrometry have facilitated protein identification and characterization from complex mixtures through improvements in detection specificity and sensitivity.

Faunal assemblages from six previously excavated archaeological sites in the region provide approximately 7200 identified specimens from suckers (Catostomidae), minnows (Cyprinidae), and salmon and trout (Salmonidae). Sr/Ca ratios, mtDNA, and traditional morphological analyses are used to establish the native status of anadromous salmonids in the region over the past ~7500 years. Implications to current debates regarding water rights and dam removal are considered. Stinchcomb, Gary [111] see Messner, Timothy C. Stiner, Mary (University of Arizona) and Natalie D. Munro (University of Connecticut-Storrs) [126] Site formation processes and economic intensification from the Upper Paleolithic through Mesolithic at Franchthi Cave, Greece We examine the complex interplay of site formation processes, climate-driven landscape change and human hunting systems during the Upper Paleolithic through Mesolithic at Franchthi Cave. There is clear evidence of diet expansion and resource intensification with time in response to declining supplies of high-yield terrestrial resources. Foraging patterns were exclusively terrestrial during the early occupations but the meat diet shifted to a mixed marine-terrestrial mode, and ultimately to technologically costly fishing activities by the Mesolithic. Variation in the intensity of the occupations in the cave is an important corollary to the results on increasing dietary breadth and is examined through (a) comparisons of the relative accumulation rates of sediments and cultural materials, and (b) trends in prey diversity as a function of the time intervals represented by the lithostratigraphic layers. The site formation data show that the intensity of occupations of the cave increased in tandem with intensified use of animal and plant resources. Stirn, Matt (Davidson College) [115] Alpine Estates: A GIS Predictive Model in Wyoming`s Wind River Range GIS computer modeling is an invaluable tool for visual and spatial analysis in archaeology. The recent discovery of six high-altitude villages and their noticeably similar microenvironments suggest potential site location patterning in Wyoming`s high mountains.

True color and polarized images captured from a petrographic microscope are merged

and co-referenced. Mineralogical composition of individual grains, voids and inclusions are quantified using multispectral image classification software, and precise percentages of each class are calculated. Segmentation of the classified images produces polygons from which morphometrics can be extracted and used to characterize ceramics. Preliminary results suggest the method is faster, more accurate and more easily reproducible than standard petrographic point counting. Stodder, Ann (Field Museum) [143] Context as Key for Understanding Mesa Verde Mortuary Data at Local and Regional Scales Mortuary data from Pueblo I sites in the Dolores and Animas-La Plata Project areas suggest that the structural and nonstructural contexts of burials are critical to understanding mortuary practice in this pivotal era and in earlier and later Ancestral Pueblo groups. Extramural interment contexts and their spatial relationships to houses, surface structures, and stockades are worthy of systematic study. Pithouse burials on floors and benches, in ventilators and in fill, vary in temporal relation to structure and site abandonment. House burials in particular suggest a fruitful area of comparison with other SW groups and an important category for metadata development. [237] see Osterholtz, Anna J.

Survey data from the Central Valley and Mixteca regions of Oaxaca reveal that the construction and location of ball courts with respect to plazas changed over time from the Late Formative to the Postclassic eras. Based on this data, we suggest that the communal role of ball courts in Oaxacan political relationships shifted as well.

It is a Mission Period adobe compound (1820s-1860s) and is part of a larger complex containing an adobe ranch house and prehistoric loci. The Estancia`s precise dimensions remain uncertain, given the lack of archival data and absence of clearly visible corners. Geophysical studies were conducted in 2003 to delineate the major structural components. The 2010 investigation addressed questions generated by the 2003 study.

Stone, Tammy (University of Colorado Denver) [201] An Architectural Biography of Point of Pines Pueblo Large communities in middle-range societies are dynamic entities in which the tensions between subgroup formation and village integration are played out daily through shifting political and social alliances through the creation and redefinition of history. Architecture, as a metaphor for social constructs in which individuals and groups live their everyday lives, can be used to interpret these social actions through the construction of a biography of architectural change.

While articles have discussed shell beads recovered from sites across Alaska, the discussions are often brief and lacking in detail. Information on species is vital to determine the raw materials available to Alaskan indigenous populations and their potential point of origin.

The region is constrained by the environment, which influences subsistence and storage practices. Research suggests that rather than look for large-scale storage facilities, archaeologists should examine changes in domestic storage, particularly at small-scale agricultural centers. Elites` ability to extract surplus in early complex societies was contingent on increased yield by producers and may be seen in increased storage capacity at the domestic level. This paper suggests ways archaeologists

can document resistance to elite control of agricultural surplus.

Strawhacker, Colleen (Arizona State University) [223] Prehispanic Irrigated Agricultural Soils on the North Coast of Peru: Understanding the Effects of Long-Term Irrigation Little is known about the effects of long-term irrigation on agricultural soils, especially in archaeological contexts. The Pampa de Chaparrí on the north coast of Peru is home to well-preserved prehispanic irrigated fields. These field systems provide an excellent opportunity to study the effects that long-term irrigation had on the soils during their use from AD 900 until Contact in AD 1532. This paper will present results from extensive sampling of agricultural soils on the Pampa and will address how long-term irrigation affects soil quality. Interpretations from this research will also address possible contemporary applications to irrigated systems used today.

Striplen, Chuck (UC Berkeley/San Francisco Estuary Institute) [222] Fire and landscape change in Central Coastal California This research contributes to a number of gaps in knowledge pertaining to the nature and extent of precolonial, indigenous resource management in the Central Coastal region of California (USA). This paper summarizes progress on analyses of fire history and historical ecology data gathered in and around the newly created Quiroste Valley State Cultural Preserve, a first contact village site roughly 50 miles south of San Francisco, CA. We also contextualize the overall research effort in the landscape of publicly owned open space management, Indian policy, and interdisciplinary research. [222] Second Organizer Stroulia, Anna (University of Southern Indiana) [164] Unusual Disposal of Ground Stone Tools: The Case of Kremasti, Greece Subsurface pits have traditionally been assigned mundane functions like storage or garbage disposal. Studies in the last fifteen years, however, suggest that some pits in prehistoric Europe were dug and used for extra-utilitarian purposes. This seems to be the case with 462 pits excavated at the Neolithic site of Kremasti, northern Greece. These pits contain ca. 2500 fragmentary and intact ground stone tools along with sherds and complete pots, disarticulated animal/human bones as well as complete skeletons, building material, lithics, ornaments, and figurines. The paper discusses the different kinds of ground stone tools and the conditions of their disposal. Strout, Nathan [139] see Bernardini, Wesley Strudwick, Ivan (LSA Associates, Inc.)

The native population of the Channel Islands rapidly declined after European occupation of California in 1769. Although the removal of the last natives is welldocumented from San Nicolas Island, it is far less wellknown for Catalina where recent research estimates a population of 3,000 was likely. Information documenting the final decline and ultimate fate of the native Santa Catalina Island population is presented.

This paper will discuss the nature, quality, and quantity of obsidian toolstone available at Glass Buttes, uses of this resource through time, archaeological work that has been done there, impact of the modern flintknappers, and the current Bureau of Land Management plan for allowing and controlling modern procurement of obsidian at Glass Buttes. Sturm, Jennie (TAG Research) and Michele Koons (Harvard University) [163] Ground-Penetrating Radar Investigations at Licapa II, Peru In June 2010, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys were conducted at the Moche center of Licapa II in the Chicama Valley, Peru, to test the hypothesis that domestic structures existed near the monumental center. Surface artifact scatters suggested there were structures in this area, though their spatial extent, orientation, and depths were unknown. Because of the three-dimensional mapping capabilities of the GPR method, all of these traits were identifiable through careful data processing and analysis. The information from these GPR maps has been used to study and understand the overall layout and composition of this site. Stutz, Aaron (Oxford College of Emory University) and Jamie Clark (Southern Methodist University) [17] Continuity Through Transitions: A Biocultural Evolutionary Perspective on Population Dynamics and Technological Change in the Upper Pleistocene The notion of paleoanthropological transition often emphasizes punctuated social, technological, or demographic change. However, many late Middle and Upper Pleistocene transitions are most clearly defined by rapid regional changes in lithic technology, while associated animal exploitation and mobility strategies may shift more gradually. This type of trend highlights the mosaic nature of biocultural change during this period. Using two transitions (the southern Levantine MP-UP and the southern African Howieson`s Poort -MSA) as a key comparison, we explore the multidimensional nature of long-term change during the Upper Pleistocene, suggesting that aspects of continuity must be considered when explaining biocultural evolutionary trends. Stvan, Jeffrey (University of Chicago) [174] Building on Tradition: The Transmission of Architectural Knowledge Among the Late Moche Although data illuminating construction and remodeling processes - and the technical choices they entail - are typically recovered when excavating pre-Columbian architectural remains on the Peruvian North Coast, the potential of these data to inform a more sophisticated conception of architecture as practice and to facilitate an understanding of how architectural knowledge was communicated, has largely been unrealized. Using data drawn from a selection of Late Moche Period sites, this paper will begin to identify and evaluate the modes by which architectural knowledge - both morphological and technical - was transmitted between individuals, as well as across time and space.

Dos Pilas, Aguateca, other cities, hilltop fortresses, and even small villages were completely destroyed with minimal or no evidence of ritual. In contrast, the international port center of Cancuen, strategic head of navigation for the entire system, was completely ritually terminated with great care and respect including the mass execution of its royalty and nobles. Here we discuss the nature and possible reasons for variability in the violent demise of the western cities and implications for theories of the Classic Maya collapse.

To understand this problematic situation, we first examine various lines of evidence ­ assemblages, features, and terrain transformations ­ upon which these conventional models of maize agriculture and their effects are based. Then, to remedy the situation, we present archaeological and paleoecological data from the Grand Canyon region to illustrate that a rejection of the Corn Paradigm as an explanatory framework unconstrains consideration of alternative paleoeconomic models and their socioecological consequences. [20] Discussant Sullivan, Elaine (UCLA) [146] 3D modeling and the 4th dimension: Reconstructing place through time at Egyptian cult sites In multi-layered archaeological sites, the earliest forms of the built landscape are often obscured by later structures, making investigation and presentation of these areas via traditional maps and plans inadequate. UCLA archaeologists have developed projects utilizing GIS and 3D modeling to represent multiple phases of past cultural landscapes. The Digital Karnak Project shows how the visualization of complex data, including factors of time and volume, can be displayed and

analyzed successfully using Virtual Reality modeling. In 3D Saqqara, we reconstruct the ancient landscape of Egypt`s famous burial ground to investigate inter -visibility between the necropolis and the neighboring city of Memphis.

These letters, exchanged between University of Tennessee staff and many other anthropologists, illustrate the close personal and professional connections of the still-young discipline. The letters discuss topics such as archaeological field and laboratory techniques, interpretations, staffing, and government relations. This correspondence, now available in digital format, provides insights to the personalities and ideas that shaped and continue to influence archaeology in the United States.

However, in tacking back and forth between our contemporary geospatial standards, analytical practices, and paradigms, we may well be propagating discords which distance us from not only the understandings of cultural landscapes we wish to investigate, but also the descendant communities to whom we must answer. From the Spanish colonial endeavor to create a strategic frontier in an Indian landscape, to the repetitive transformations of Mexican then American land tenure, the historic site of Casitas Viejas has long been a locus of cartographic contestation. Supak, Karen (BHE Environmental, Inc.) [224] Technological Stasis through Social Change: Understanding Motivations for Lithic Procurement Behavior at Clarksville Base, Ft.

Patterns of raw material exploitation along Little West Fork Creek indicate that methods for and products of chert procurement have remained remarkably static over time, despite corresponding differences in prehistoric settlement patterning, social complexity, and relative group mobility. Results indicate that a number of motivating factors influenced prehistoric lithic exploitation in the Fort Campbell region, including chert quality, distance from the source, regional variation in lithic types, and ease of raw material procurement.

warfare and conflict had on defining and transforming pre-contact community identities. Defensive sites are a principal indicator of the presence of warfare in the past and have been used to argue for the presence of intravillage community organization and co-ordination. In this paper, I use the results of two quantitative analyses of the defensibility rock features in the Lower Fraser River Canyon to evaluate whether the construction of these features required community co-ordination and suggest that we need to examine the defensibility of the entire landscape, not just sites. [232] First Chair [232] Second Organizer Surette, Flannery (University of Western Ontario, London) [49] On Convents and Acllawasis--Spanish Analogies and the Policies of Imperial Assimilation Beginning in 1534, the Spanish recorded descriptions of the houses (acllawasi) of chosen woman (the acllacona) through which the Inca incorporated the daughters of conquered peoples into the empire. These houses were often described as analogous to Spanish Roman Catholic convents which were used to acculturate the daughters of Andean indigenous elite. I argue that the analogy between acllawasi and covento is not mere bias but indicative of an example of the policies of assimilation under Inca rule as seen through a Spanish lens who also actively employed similar tactics in their own consolidation of power.

It was discovered by an avocational archaeologist and excavated through the University of New Hampshire with low-technology methods. Thirty years later it remains a unique window on coastal occupations of 4.000 years ago for the southern Gulf of Maine. A terrestrial occupation site was encroached upon by rising sea level in a low energy environment, preserved below salt marsh, and defended by bedrock outcrops. It has excellent preservation of bone and soils. The potential is high for both submerged terrestrial and primary wet sites at much greater depths.

A case study to illustrate this relationship takes place at the Battle of Mystic Fort, a privately owned Pequot War battlefield site in southeastern Connecticut. Despite contemporary conflicts in the region, researchers from the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center were able to gain support from landowners to conduct fieldwork at the site. This paper will address some of these conflicts and how archaeologists were able to address landowner concerns and meet their research objectives. Swartz Dodd, Lynn [220] see Friedman, Elizabeth S.

Previous investigations prior to the construction of hydroelectric dams near these areas identified hundreds of prehistoric and historic sites, and our field investigation also identified numerous sites around each area. Large-scale examination of these sites allows observations of patterns and changes in settlement distribution over time in the region, and illuminates variables that contributed to site locations. Swenson, Edward (University of Toronto) [125] The Search for Moche Thirdspace: The Politics of Place-Making in Andean Prehistory Dr. Mackey has made important contributions deciphering the political significance of built environments in the Andes, contending that Chimú monuments represented more than the symbolic byproduct of sociopolitical forces. Instead, power was directly negotiated through the design, construction, and experience of authoritative architecture. Building on these insights, I explore Moche representations of space, arguing that conscious projects of place-making played a critical role in the formation of Moche political subjectivity. Ultimately, an examination of contradictions in the conceived, perceived, and lived dimensions of Jequetepeque ceremonial architecture permits an appreciation of the cultural particulars of Moche identity politics and ideological struggles.

In 2009-2010 the Gila Archaeological Project conducted limited exploration of Ojo Caliente, a fort used during the Apache Wars of the late 1800s. Investigations included ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and walkover surveys, and partial mapping of the adobe structures. This poster will analyze the information gathered, supplementing it with archival research, in order to better understand the fort`s layout and the military`s use of built and open space in fortifications. Of particular interest is predicting where an unmarked cemetery could fit into the fort`s configuration, as its location has never been pinpointed, and suggesting areas for future GPR and surface survey.

The initial paleoethnobotanical analyses have focused primarily on the significance and implications of two important economic plant taxa from the family Cucurbitaceae: the gourd/squash (Cucurbita sp.) and the bottle gourd (Lagenaria sp.). The materials from this site provide valuable insight into the biogeography of both gourd species as well as ancient pre- or non-agricultural management and manipulation of these and other wild plant resources. Tanaka, Yutaka (Ibaraki University) [149] Contribution of the Burial Group of Chiefly Lineage` Approach to Japanese Archaeology and Issues Related to this Approach The burial group of chiefly lineage` concept assumes that a group of burial mounds clustered in a small area and built in chronologically successive stages was a result of generations of a single lineage of chiefs building their own graves. This concept is an important underlying assumption of an influential argument for the Kofun society as an early state. The problem is that, while this concept incorporates some vague assumption, the early state model has gone beyond this vagueness can tolerate. When we overcome this problem, this concept can make further contributions to Japanese studies of state formation.

Volcanic events are indicated by a high relative percent composition of smectite and volcanic quartz in the reservoir sediments. Sequences of volcanic minerals are correlative with magnetic susceptibility records and provide important new insights into the paleoenvironmental record of Tikal. Volcanic ash fall across the southern Maya Lowlands may have occasionally affected regional climate, but also provided an important economic resource. Tatchell, Brittney (Binghamton University, SUNY) [49] Identifying the chosen women of the Inka: A biological profile of aclla crania from Pachacamac, Peru

As an institution of the Inka state, the aclla reflected socio-religious values of the Empire and its influence on contemporaneous cultural groups. Analysis of aclla skeletal remains can provide unique information about the composition of this social class and its diverse roles within the Empire. Identification of aclla burial contexts relies in part upon the ability to discriminate physical traits representative of this group. However, a case study from Pachacamac, Peru highlights the tautological nature of assessing aclla traits from presumed aclla remains. Preliminary biological findings for this unusual sacrificial sample are also discussed.

However, over the past few decades, the government has taken action to increase the level of tribal participation in historic preservation. This research examines the effectiveness of federal action as well as the conditions that empower Native American tribes to act as stewards of their own archaeology and cultural identity. Taube, Karl [41] Discussant Taylor, Amanda (University of Washington) [232] Triangulating the Emergence of Territorial Circumscription in the San Juan Islands, Washington Ethnographers in the Gulf of Georgia emphasized territorial systems where access to land, water, and resources was negotiated through inter-village kin ties. The development of these systems during prehistoric times remains poorly understood. Following Alison Wylie`s suggestion that strong evidential reasoning can be achieved by triangulating multiple lines of evidence, I test hypotheses on the emergence of territorial circumscription in the San Juan Islands by integrating three different approaches. I build on a traditional settlement pattern study by considering a human behavioral ecology approach to site distribution and a landscape archaeology approach to presence and abundance of defensive sites.

Floral assemblages from various type sites are examined in detail, as well as distributions of material items associated with food preparation. Local floral food staples are analyzed illustrating caloric values, protein and fat proportion, and nutrient contribution which are compared to foods more often considered high status or prestigious. This data is supplemented by reexamination of existent ethnographic literature. Using this multifaceted approach reveals surprising trends crucial for understanding the roles of individuals and task groups within the greater prehistoric social organization.

Terrace evolution and site formation at Espadanal can be correlated with depositional history at the nearby site of Gato Preto. This regional geoarchaeological approach provides environmental and chronological context for evaluating competing interpretations of the Early Upper Paleolithic archaeological record in central Portugal.

These studies indicate that the Petrified Forest cluster was an independent social entity with distinct, locally-produced material culture and unique patterns of regional interaction.

For the first time, high precision lead and strontium isotopic analyses have been applied to over 25 raw, partially worked, and finished turquoise objects recovered from the canyon`s largest Great House, Pueblo Bonito. The data from these turquoise artifacts are compared to the lead and strontium isotopic signatures of 18 major areas of turquoise mineralization in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, California, and Nevada and the sources represented by these objects are revealed.

Thomas, Ben (Archaeological Institute of America) and Meredith Anderson (Archaeological Institute of America) [259] Sustainable Site Preservation: Beyond Bricks and Mortar The future of archaeological sites goes beyond traditional conservation methods. The sustainability of preservation ultimately lies in a local community dedicated to the upkeep of a site. To this end, the Archaeological Institute of America redirected its Site Preservation Program to focus on outreach, education, and economic development with the belief that this approach would make a greater impact than funding expensive conservation work at only a few sites. Nearly two years later, this approach is reflected upon through data, case studies, and research. Ideas on simple methods to reach out to communities surrounding archaeological sites will also be presented.

Thomas, Noah (Olivas Adobe Interpretive Center) [154] Making Archaeology Relevant for a Diverse Public: Exhibit Planning and Display at the Small Adobe Interpretive Center, Olivas Adobe, Ventura, California The Olivas Adobe State Monument, in Ventura, California, is a Rancho period two-story adobe built in the 1840s. Two archaeological excavations have taken place on the grounds, but despite this history of work, archaeological information is not well integrated within its interpretive scheme. With the completion of a seismic retrofit in 2010, the Small Adobe Interpretive Center was established to provide a venue for an interactive historical display. This paper documents the attempt at reintegrating the Olivas Adobe's archaeologically documented heritage within a display environment, linking archaeological data to visual, historical, and tactile displays aimed at engaging a diverse public.

Based on the AMS radiocarbon analysis and spatial distribution of artifacts from targeted excavations, specific building functions, duration of occupation, and temporal patterning across settlement groups are discussed. Settlement research at Uxbenká suggests periods of rapid growth punctuating what otherwise appear to be long stretches of relative equilibrium. These periods of growth likely correspond with regional demographic shifts and increasing visibility of highly networked elites.

We quantified levels of genetic variation in M. zapota from the Petén region of Guatemala, and described how that genetic variation is structured among subpopulations from diverse habitat types and histories. The hypothesis was that cultivation of M. zapota trees by the ancient Maya led to overall reduced levels of genetic diversity. Our results suggest instead that M. zapota subpopulations have high levels of diversity with low levels of genetic structuring among various habitats.

This paper presents a preliminary effort to construct a database of mortuary programs practiced at large Hohokam villages in the Salt River valley. It discusses the variables necessary to describe both Pre-Classic and Classic period mortuary remains documented at different settlements along separate canal systems. The data suggest complex patterns in body treatments, handling of remains, and spatial relationships of mortuary remains and architectural features. [143] First Chair Thompson, Robert (University of Minnesota) [15] Food Residues and Inca Lifeways at Palmitopamba, Ecuador The site of Palmitopamba, located Northwest of Quito in Pinchincha Province, Ecuador contains a long record of Yumbo occupation, followed by an Inca presence late in prehistory. Unlike the Inca conquest sites nearer the core of the empire, the Inca at Palmitopamba seemed to have adopted the Yumbo lifeways. Food residues from Inca pottery vessels recovered from Palmitopamba yielded phytolith assemblages sufficient to trace the lineages of maize present. Inca vessels contained maize similar to that grown by the Yumbo. This is consistent with a view of the Inca as being at the edge of their expansion, having a limited impact on previously established local lifeways. Thompson, Victor (The Ohio State University) [198] Conduits of Complexity: Creating, Commemorating, and Materializing Surplus in HunterGatherer Economies Recent discussions of hunter-gatherer complexity rely on aggrandizer arguments to explain among other things social inequality, monumentality, etc. Implicit in these models is the control and production of surplus by agents. While informative for some areas, such models provide little in the way of how traditions of surplus production are sustained over extended time frames or why the general populace might engage in such

Bryant, Jr (Texas A&M University) [35] Experimentally Tracking Geophyte Microfossils from Raw to Baked-Residue Status Conventional-oven baking experiments with underground storage organs (USOs) of false garlic, camas, onions, winecup, and rain lily from Texas assessed the potential of earth ovens to yield microfossils from wild geophytes baked therein. Identifiable starch grains, phytoliths, calcium oxalate crystals, and plant-food fibers were exuded from USOs during the baking process, primarily via water vapor, accumulated on the inside of cooking containers and leafy packing material, and survived prolonged baking (8-36 hrs). Accordingly, it is scientifically reasonable, provided adequate preservation conditions, to expect to find microfossil evidence of plantfoods within remains of ancient earth ovens wherein those foods were cooked.

Thornton, Christopher (George Mason University) [13] Indus-Mesopotamian Relations: The View from Southeastern Arabia Third millennium relations between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley have been explored by scholars for almost a century. While the relationships between these two civilizations were once modeled as two "cores" interacting over a cultural wasteland, this was challenged by excavations in Southeastern Iran and later Southeastern Arabia. This research demonstrated how independent cultural groups served as "middlemen" in the relations between the two civilizations. Continued work in this frontier zone, particular on the Jiroft and Umm-an-Nar Cultures, has changed the picture once again. This paper presents a new model for economic and political interaction across this region. [167] see Massey, David Throgmorton, Kellam (University of Colorado, Boulder) [43] Practice Theory and the Study of Ground Stone Although subsistence and economy traditionally receive priority in ground stone studies, more nuanced interpretation is possible by recognizing that manos and metates represent a considerable labor investment. Applying practice theory to the study of ground stone allows archaeologists to better assess the relationships among critical subsistence tools and daily social experiences. Ethnographic evidence suggests that grinding tools are primarily the purview of women. This novel approach to an oft-overlooked artifact class will explore the ways in which ground stone can be used to understand gendered practices in the prehistoric American Southwest.

Thurston, Tina (SUNY Buffalo) [198] Surplus from below: self organization of production in early historic Northern Europe Surplus production in many regions is traditionally linked to elite power, so that virtually any sign of increase is automatically attributed to elite organization or domination. This may or may not be the case elsewhere, but in Northern Europe, relationships between subjecthood and rulership -- ordinary people and leaders -­ were not absolute. Social distances could be traversed through skill or luck. While rulers taxed and conscripted, farmers concealed, evaded taxes, and rebelled. Episodes of increased surplus production often appear linked to farmer agency rather than royal demands. Tiballi, Anne (Binghamton University) [49] Expressions of Ethnic Identity Within an Inka State Institution: The Acllas of Pachacamac The Inka employed large-scale, state-mandated migration of subject groups to redistribute labor sources, quell uprisings, and populate institutions. One of these institutions was the Aclla, a highly specialized class of female artisans who produced textiles for the state. The majority of our knowledge of this group comes from colonial documents, which suggest that the Acllas` ties with their natal communities were ruptured upon their induction into the state apparatus. Archaeological materials from the Cemetery of the Sacrificed Women, Pachacamac, Peru, suggest that these ties, expressed in textiles, were maintained throughout the Acllas` lives, and continued after their death.

Petrographic and distributional analyses were used to examine the role played by households in these activities. It would appear that certain groups had greater access to non-local stone resources than others. This variation correlated with differences in household organizational strategies. The study also emphasizes the importance of using interdisciplinary approaches in materials analysis. Tien, Joseph H. [72] see Devault, Alison M.

Faunal and archaeological analyses suggest a coordinated work force produced a mixed economy of fish, cultigens, and domesticated sheep and goats. This study examined enthesopathies (musculo-skeletal stress markers) of the proximal ulnae on human skeletal remains from Tell Abraq, UAE. These markers indicated fishing net usage through evidence of extension, flexion, and supination of the lower arm. Males exhibited a higher prevalence and more pronounced muscle markings consistent with more frequent fishing activities. Tito, Raul [206] see Belknap, Samuel L.

Recently obtained radiocarbon dates suggest the burial dates to the 4th Century BC, making it one of the oldest burials of its kind in the Maya Lowlands. Furthermore, the early dating of the burial indicates that one of the tomb`s vessels bears the earliest known representation of the Jester God headress in the Maya Lowlands. In addition, phytolith analysis has shed light upon previously unknown aspects of the burial assemblage and mortuary ritual associated with this elite burial. Tomasto C., Elsa [71] see Peters, Ann H.

The evidence gathered in the 2010 field season suggests that a comprehensive analysis of artifact assemblages recovered in monumental spaces may infer on the heterogeneity of use and access of monumental architecture that goes beyond elite-based explanations of ancient Maya monumentality. Tremain, Cara (Trent University) [9] Utilization of Looters` Trenches at Structures D4 and D9, Ka`Kabish, Northern Belize Having once been described as the most looted ancient Maya site in Belize, Ka`Kabish may be thought of as a site with data that is anything but forthcoming. Yet results of the 2010 field season, where investigation included clearing, excavating, and mapping looters` trenches in the large pyramidal structures of D4 and D9, illustrate that Ka`Kabish has worthwhile information for archaeologists and can contribute toward an improved understanding of monumental architecture in northern Belize.

Trigg, Heather (Univ Massachusetts Boston) and Kurt Anschuetz (Rio Grande Foundation) [53] A View of La Cienega: At the Intersection of the Iberian, Tewa, and Keres Worlds in Seventeenth-Century New Mexico The relationship between colonizers and colonized in 17th-century New Mexico remains poorly understood. Pueblo peoples had developed sustainable relationships with the environment. Spanish colonists introduced new agricultural systems, but they depended on the Pueblos for survival. Recent research suggests that extreme environmental conditions, combined with incessant demands by colonists on the Pueblos for labor and other subsistence needs led to famine and contributed to the Pueblo Rebellion. We explore the relationships of a 17thcentury Spanish ranch with two nearby Pueblo villages ­ one Tewa and one Keres, examining the competing agricultural systems and the colonists' dependence on these Pueblos.

This valley, named after the 14th century fort within it, is located in Mewat, the land of the Meos; the predatory` and rebellious` neighbors of the Delhi Sultanate. By studying this instance of the materialization of the political projects and fates of an elite Meo lineage, the paper broaches issues of materiality, politics and alterity. Tromp, Monica (Idaho State University) and John Dudgeon (Idaho State University) [236] SEM-EDS is an effective tool for population-level analysis of microfossils extracted from prehistoric human dental calculus Sedimentary microfossil studies are widely used to infer diet in past populations. While profoundly useful for understanding natural and agricultural ecologies, they do not necessarily correspond with the archaeological event of interest: What did people put in their mouth?` We propose that extracting and quantifying microfossils from human dental calculus is a more appropriate method for understanding population-level variation in diet. Using SEM-EDS we have examined microfossils extracted from human teeth of prehistoric Rapanui (Easter Islanders) and argue that this method provides a more efficient and repeatable means of analysis than light microscopy, largely due to ease of morphological identification.

Tsai, Howard (Museum of Anthropology) [125] The Domestic Architecture of Las Varas Las Varas, a site in the middle Jequetepeque Valley, is situated 40 km from the Pacific Ocean. This Late Intermediate (AD 1000-1460) site has abundant Coastal Cajamarca-style bowls, as well as domestic pottery similar to that used in highland Cajamarca. Recent excavations exposed a series of residences, ritual plazas, and cemeteries. This talk presents results from my excavation of stone-walled residences constructed on hillside terraces. I will discuss how these residences and neighborhoods can be used to document the presence of diverse cultural practices and possibly diverse ethnic groups in the Jequetepeque Valley. Tsesmeli, Evangelia (Southern Methodist University) [135] Prehistoric Settlement and Continuity in the Middle Rio Puerco Valley The Middle Rio Puerco valley forms part of the Rio Puerco watershed, the largest tributary of the Middle Rio Grande basin. Archaeological surveys, excavations and CRM projects provided the corpus of data for this investigation on settlements and continuity of habitation within the valley from the archaic to the end of Pueblo IV periods. A composite view of past habitation patterns in relation to environmental settings emerges defining the cultural landscape at the area. A closer look at the material record provides insights into the social landscape and community organization of the valley residents during the tumultuous Pueblo III-IV periods. Tsouras, Theodore (National Park Service) [248] The Easy Way Down: Documentation of Walnut Canyon National Monument`s Ancient Water Trail This presentation summarizes recent documentation by NPS archeologists of a massive prehistoric trail that accesses the difficult-to-reach, but lush riparian floor of Walnut Canyon. The trail consists of several broad switchbacks stabilized with large, dry-laid retaining walls ­ some of which contain stones weighing several tons each. Likely constructed in the 12th century A.D., during the height of Walnut Canyon`s prehistoric Sinagua occupation, this trail provided and continues to provide the safest and most efficient access to the resource-rich canyon bottom through the prohibitively steep layer of Coconino Sandstone. Tsukamoto, Kenichiro (University of Arizona) [182] The Social Roles of Plazas during Turbulent Times: The Classic Maya Center of El Palmar, Campeche, Mexico Plazas likely played crucial roles in establishing shared identities during the politically tumultuous Middle Classic period (A.D. 400-600) in the Central Maya Lowlands. Due to El Palmar`s location at the boundaries of three large contemporaneous political spheres--Tikal, Calakmul, and Río Bec--I suggest that political upheavals affected El Palmar more acutely than neighboring

centers. By examining excavation data from the previous year`s fieldwork, I attempt to show how the construction and contestation of shared identities can be traced in the archaeological record, in particular by analyzing the diversity of spectacles and the process of building and remodeling plazas. Tucker, Bryan (Georgia Department of Natural Resources), Heath Tucker (University of Georgia) and Matt Luke (Georgia Southern University) [161] Archaeology and Augmented Reality: Using AR to Enhance Archaeological Interpretation Augmented Reality (AR) is a process which overlays virtual images, sounds, movies, or other data onto the real world. Historically, constraints on the size and cost of the necessary equipment have slowed its uptake in the public sector. However, recent advances in smartphones and tablet computers have removed these impediments. We discuss ways in which AR can be used to enhance the interpretation and presentation of archaeological sites and artifacts. By enhancing interactive displays and superimposing sensory information on the landscape, AR has the power to actively engage visitors, transforming them from passive spectators to active participants in a historic landscape.

Yet, recent paleoenvironmental research, combined with the prehispanic occupant`s heavy dependence on agriculture, indicate that past environments were less degraded than environments observed today. Thus, fundamental questions, such as the nature and timing of human settlement, abandonment, and environmental change, remain unresolved. This paper reports on findings of a pilot project to determine the viability of dendrochronology, a methodology previously not used in Mesoamerican archaeology, as a way to address these outstanding questions.

Turner, Bethany (Georgia State University) [49] Locating the aclla: Isotope bioarchaeology and the reconstruction of Inka social class Scholarly interpretations of the aclla class have been strengthened by more nuanced consideration of their multifaceted roles within the Inka state. However, interpreting the aclla first requires finding them in archaeological populations in ways that avoid gendered assumptions of material culture and archaeological context. Multi-isotope analysis permits rough estimation of social class via demographic composition and subsistence variation, and when combined with sex ratios, may permit identification of aclla independent of material culture. A case study from Machu Picchu is presented here, embedded in a discussion of the limitations and pitfalls of using these techniques in reconstructing Inka classes. Turner, Sara (Georgia State University) [154] All About Archaeology In this paper I will discuss the development of archaeology kits for third through fifth grade children.

Children will learn about past human culture and behavior through hands-on projects and educational lesson plans. I will detail the process of constructing lesson plans, developing projects, and providing reading books appropriate for the elementary level. In addition, I intend to discuss the content and format of the kits with elementary teachers for comments on how they think children will respond to the material.

What are the best ways of identifying the use of fire in the archaeological record? What is the nature of residues left from fermenting beverages? How can we identify the use of organic pigments? One analytical approach will not fit all. The uses of a broad scanning technique called DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time) are highlighted, and follow on research described.

Tuwaletstiwa, Judy [122] see Tuwaletstiwa, Phillip J. Tuwaletstiwa, Phillip and Judy Tuwaletstiwa (Artist) [122] Ways of Seeing Archeology is a combination of hard and soft sciences. The hard sciences use rigid protocols to govern their application. The protocols of the soft sciences allow greater latitude for interpretation. What lies outside these parameters are metaphors. Ancient people saw the world metaphorically. We believe the judicial use of dreams, myths and artistic vision can enhance scientific interpretation. We explore this in our novel about the origins and meaning of Chaco Canyon, The Laughing Spiders. Tykot, Robert (U. of South Florida) [97] New Approaches to Obsidian Studies in the CentralWestern Mediterranean Over the past fifteen years, analysis of several thousand obsidian source samples and artifacts from the centralwestern Mediterranean has provided an excellent dataset to address neolithization and initial island settlement, craft specialization, and changes in political and socioeconomic systems from the beginning of the Early Neolithic (ca. 6000 BC) thru the end of the Bronze Age (ca. 800 BC). This has been accomplished thru detailed studies of the geological sources, and the development of low-cost methods of analysis, including portable, nondestructive XRF instruments. Integration with typological and use-wear analysis has provided information on continuity and change in these ancient societies. [193] Discussant [63] see Ashkanani, Hasan J.

Removing a living human head utilizing a tumi (simple copper knife) would have challenged Moche decapitators due to the small and thin knife design, complex neck anatomy, potential for victim movement, and penchant for carotid arteries to spray pumping blood. At Dos Cabezas, evidence suggests the Moche used preliminary exsanguination to produce a predictable volume of blood controlled for collection in a vessel. Thus, systematic decapitation followed only after death. Ullah, Isaac (Arizona State University, SHESC), C. Michael Barton (Arizona State University), Sean M.

Dynamics (MedLanD) Project has developed a modeling laboratory to explore the complex processes that characterize coupled human and natural systems. The laboratory focuses on subsistence-level agropastoralism because such socioeconomic systems dominate most of the Holocene archaeological record and also remain common today. In this paper, we summarize some of the major lessons we learned about the process of doing human-natural systems modeling during the course of the MedLanD Project, including issues of connecting models from different programming environments, sensitivity analysis, scale and resolution, building process equations, and choosing most relevant output data.

This paper explores who was buried in the cemetery from a paleodemographic perspective and how that relates to settlement transition. Early Bronze IA (EB IA) tombs contain fewer people than charnel houses from EB II-III, but include many neonates and infants. The EB II-III tombs house children, but not many infants. Dental morphological traits show that EB IA inhabitants were buried by family group, and cranial non-metric traits suggest that a similar pattern was followed in EB II-III, despite larger group inclusion in single tombs.

Semasiographic and epigraphic readings of carved megaliths on several buildings around the plaza suggest that during the city`s first several centuries communal forms of political authority persisted alongside newer, more exclusionary ones. The scale, symbolism, and accessibility of the plaza indicate that the power of rulers was downplayed in favor of communal institutions. At A.D. 200, however, evidence suggests a major political upheaval as indicated by the dismantling of several monumental buildings and their associated narrative programs. We consider causes and consequences of this upheaval. Ure, Scott (Brigham Young University) [187] Fremont Pottery Standardization: A Preliminary Examination of Fremont Painted Bowls and their Degree of Standardized Morphological Characteristics Although the Fremont culture has been studied for decades, very little is currently understood about their social, political, and community organization. One aspect of Fremont material culture which may help determine their degree of social complexity is their painted bowls-- both the black-on-gray and black-on-white varieties. This paper explores to what degree Fremont painted bowls

may have been standardized, and whether the degree of standardization is significant enough to draw any conclusions about the Fremont socioeconomic structure.

From local cord-keepers to provincial overseers to administrators in the capital, Cusco, the khipu played an active role in constructions of sociopolitical identities and relations among groups within the Empire. This paper looks at Spanish commentary on cord-keeping, as well as at khipu samples, to address the question: What role did the khipus play in articulating political relations and the objectification of identities in the Empire? Urunuela, Gabriela (Universidad de las Americas) and Patricia Plunket (Universidad de las Américas, Puebla) [98] Costumes and Puppets among Cholula's Early Classic Figurines The transition to urbanism implied multiple modifications in prehispanic social behavior; we explore some of these, as reflected in an Early Classic Cholula figurine sample. One major change was that the previous representation of the human body almost or entirely naked was substituted with the portrayal of clothed individuals. Female images became standardized and static, while males increased in number, ornamentation and variation. Among the males, two groups lead us to suggest that some figurines perhaps helped in the transmission of oral tradition via miniature theatrical performances: 1) costumed or masked personages, and 2) a set of horizontally moved puppets.

The type of food served at feasts is assumed inconsequential, yet the dominance of camelid consumption in private and public contexts suggests a preference. Recent research in a non-elite residential neighborhood of the Tiwanaku capital reinserts camelids in the life of the city and polity`s residents by focusing on quotidian cuisine, and argues that the daily consumption of this preferred food represents a local way to be` Tiwanaku.

Imagined narratives can be useful tools for analysis, and they can give voice to diverse individuals and subaltern groups.

It is during the Late Intermediate Period that metal extraction underwent an important increase in scale and intensity: material remains associated with mining sites are more numerous and infrastructures more complex. This reveals a process in which mineral extraction went from small-scale and informal to state-controlled, testifying to the heightened social role of metals in late prehispanic times.

ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 76TH ANNUAL MEETING

Over 400 tombs from 6 nearby sites in the Northern Titicaca Basin dating to the Late Intermediate and Inka Periods (AD 1000-1532) were systematically surveyed and examined for patterns in style, construction, and spatial distribution. Slab-cist tombs (the dominant type in this region) vary considerably in size and elaboration at both the intrasite and intersite level, suggesting that tomb construction helped define distinct social groups within regions and within sites. Tomb construction techniques also span a gradient between slab-cist tombs and aboveground chullpas, suggesting that the former were conceptually and functionally foundational to chullpa building in the Titicaca Basin. Velazquez, Adrian (INAH) and Emiliano Melgar (INAH) [116] Tenochcan Palace Productions of Shell and Lapidary Objects Recent researches have shown that a great amount of objects found in the offerings of the Sacred Precinct of Tenochtitlan, are local productions and not pieces obtained by tribute and commerce, as originally thought. An example of that are the researches about the manufacturing techniques of shell and lapidary objects, which morphological and technological standardization, along with its exclusiveness to the offerings of the Great Temple, allowed us to propose that they are palace productions made for the most elitist religious cult of the mexica society.

To date, there are several examples of successful archaeological ceramic protein residue analysis. However, much of the research has relied on targeted protein analysis, a method that is of limited value in situations where little a priori knowledge regarding the artifacts under study is available. In order to refine our ability to conduct non-targeted protein research, we conducted a multi-part analysis of protein binding, survivability and identification via the use of experimentally prepared and archaeological ceramic artifacts, total organic carbon analysis, protein assays and HPLC-MS/MS. Results confirm previous research on protein-ceramic binding and identify key topics for future research. [19] Discussant Venables, Barney [19] see Stevens, Stanley M.

Previously recovered mortuary remains offers a wealth of data to address questions surrounding local social change during the middle to late Bronze Age transition in north central Eurasia. Through a multivariate statistical analysis of two cemeteries from a single microregion (Bestamak - Middle Bronze Age) and (Lisakovsk - Late Bronze Age), we have the ability to examine these societies at different scales.

Human sacrifice has deep roots in Northern Peru, and the evidence of such practices has grown significantly in recent years. Have new discoveries helped to clarify temporal trends and overall patterns? In many ways, the picture has become more complex, making simple categorizations difficult. How much can we know about the motivations and significance of sacrificial practices from archaeological evidence and the interpretation of iconography? These questions increasingly are coming to the forefront in current research.

Despite more than 500 features recorded and more than 300 inhumations excavated, emphasis has prevailed on reconstruct daily life and important aspects on ritual have dissolved among subsistence or health conditions information. We explore a different approach to reconstruct ritual among these communities with a diverse lecture of same data.

Yet, there are few archaeological cases of clearly identified ritual activity at this level. Specially prepared floor sequences in ritual structures at Keatley Creek dating to the early period of village formation provide one of the only fine-grained records for examining such issues.

In the Andes, during the late intermediate and late horizon periods, textile production has been recognized as an important economic factor in the development of state level societies. However, little has been said about the nature of this activity and its social implications during earlier periods and in non-state level societies. In this paper I will present the most important antecedents of

earlier textile production in the central coast of Peru, placing special focus on the relationship between the nature of textile production, and its economic implications in social organization. Vining, Benjamin (Boston University) [39] Rural Land-Use dynamics and the Tiwanaku State in the Suches Basin, Southern Peru Recent surveys in the high-elevation Lake Suches region (Moquegua, Peru) documents a long and stable history of pastoral land-use. Suches lies directly between Middle Horizon urban Tiwanaku and its principal colonies in the Moquegua Valley, but no direct evidence of a state presence has been recorded. Closer examination of shifting pastoral patterns, however, indicates the indirect influence of Tiwanaku on isolated rural communities. Atomistic pastoralists intensified pastoral production ultimately driven by Tiwanaku economic interests. These results refine understandings of the magnitude that archaic states` influence had, even in areas of no apparent state presence.

Efforts to restore agricultural production to areas of leeward Kohala suggest seasonal climatic variation influenced agricultural potential; dry, low elevation areas could yield only in the winter wet season, when low temperatures constrained production in the wetter upland areas.

Historic avulsions produced major changes in delta structure with significant human and settlement impact, and floods and avulsions have constituted a pattern of risk and change defining regional Late Holocene landscape evolution since the stabilization of Post-Pleistocene sea-level rise. Communities, such as that represented by Olmec San Andrés near La Venta, flourished and failed within this context. Climate and sealevel driven change are two significant factors impacting settlements and polities explored in this paper. von Schwerin, Jennifer [128] see Richards-Rissetto, Heather Vonarx, Amy Jo [92] see Hodgins, Greg W L Voorhies, Barbara (University of California, Santa Barbara) [88] The Site that Keeps on Giving: Thirty plus Years of Research at Tlacuachero This paper presents an introduction to the symposium

Voss, Barbara (Stanford University) [48] A Land of Ethnogenesis Hailed as a land of new beginnings, California is often imagined as a place where people come to reinvent themselves. Ethnogenesis ­ the formation of new ethnic identities ­ is one such strategy of reinvention. Archaeological investigations of indigenous, colonial, and early American contexts reveal a persistent tension between the social mobility made possible by ethnogenesis, and the structural conditions and power relations inherent to ethnic differentiation. In particular, the material culture of daily life points to the tight relationship between labor and consumption in negotiating new social identities. [16] Discussant Wack, Lynn (University of Texas San Antonio) [177] Analyzing Change in Animal Use from the Late Archaic to the Terminal Late Prehistoric Periods at the Burris Bison site (41VT66) in South Texas Archaeological sites containing bison in South Texas increases between the Late Archaic (400 B.C. to A.D. 800) and the Terminal Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1200-1600) periods. Human behavioral ecology suggests that such an increase should produce a narrowing of the diet breath. I compare the Late Archaic and Terminal Late Prehistoric faunal assemblages at site 41TV66. These assemblages reveal increased presence of bison during the Terminal Late Prehistoric and an expansion, rather than a narrowing, of the diet breadth. Such a pattern is consistent with a variable bison presence in this area during the Terminal Late Prehistoric.

Waguespack, Nicole (University of Wyoming) and Todd Surovell (University of Wyoming) [57] Folsom Houses & House Life In Paleoindian contexts only a handful of sites provide a glimpse at Folsom household organization because direct physical remains of architectural features are rarely preserved. The construction of shelters, explicitly designed to keep some behaviors and processes in and other behaviors and processes out, should result in curvilinear and continuous breaks in artifact spatial patterning. On the basis of artifact density gradients, burned artifact distributions and radial discard patterns, we identify the presence of three residential structures at Barger Gulch Locality B (5GA195), a Folsom campsite in Middle Park, Colorado. Wahoff, Tanya (AECOM) and Jamie Cleland (AECOM) [50] Native American Trails of the American Southwest Found throughout the deserts of the American Southwest, Native American trails range from an expression of the purely practical to the intangible or symbolic (story-telling or dream travel). Physical characteristics, associations, and ethnographic documentation all provide insights into these expressions, although interpretations are often wideranging. This paper provides an discussion of the range of variability in trails in the American Southwest deserts, focusing on the issue of homogeneity vs. heterogeneity in their development and manifestations. Wake, Thomas (Cotsen Institute of Archaeology at UCLA) and Benito Guzman (UCLA) [88] Archaic Period Vertebrate Exploitation at Tlacuachero, ChiapaS Recent excavations at the Pacific coastal Archaic Period shell midden site of Tlacuachero, Chiapas, have recovered a diverse array of vertebrate faunal remains. Fish remains dominate these samples that also include reptiles, birds and mammals. Several of the bone samples are associated with constructed surfaces. Distribution of vertebrate remains across these surfaces along with changing fishing strategies through time are examined. Implications for resource depression or stability and regional resource use patterns are discussed. Wake, Thomas [186] see Barge, Meghan S. [67] see Davis, Michael H.

Walker, Renee (SUNY College at Oneonta) [70] Prehistoric Dogs in the Eastern United States: The Sacred and the Secular This research addresses the question of what role dogs played in prehistoric Native American culture. Dogs from interment sites throughout eastern North America are analyzed to compare skeletal morphology, size, and sex ratios. Interment patterns are explored to discern how dogs were viewed in these societies. It is hoped that examining the similarities and differences of dogs and dog burials throughout the east will better inform researchers about this phenomenon. Ultimately, this research suggests that dogs played multiple roles linked to both secular and sacred aspects of life. Walker, William (New Mexico State University) [24] Animation and Conversion in the Ancient Southwest In studies of animate universes of past peoples it is important to understand how social relationships between human and non human beings (e.g., artifacts, architecture, wind, rain, clouds, stars) are established and the contexts in which they change. In this paper I explore the changing social relationships between people, pottery styles, architecture, and a range of other nonhuman beings in the Mogollon region of the American Southwest. I am particularly interested in how weather contributes to changing contexts of animacy and I seek arguments that bridge the gap between materialist and idealist approaches to the topic. Wall, Bridget [239] see Larson, William E. Wallace, Henry (Desert Archaeology Inc) and Michael Lindeman (Desert Archaeology, Inc.) [52] Competition and Cooperation: Late Classic Period Aggregation in the Southern Tucson Basin By A.D. 1300, all of the major villages along the Martinez Hill to A-Mountain reach of the Santa Cruz River in the Southern Tucson Basin were abandoned and the remaining population aggregated around Martinez Hill. Prior marital ties, craft specialization, and communal water and land rights meant that the nucleated groups were familiar; however, the division of space and presence of 12 platform mounds indicates controlled competition between the multiple village social units that came together. Missing within the new settlement structure are communal facilities that might have promoted a cohesive identity and served to mitigate tensions.

Waller, Kyle (University of Missouri-Columbia), Kathy Durand (Eastern New Mexico University) and Jack Fenner (Australian National University) [219] Strontium Isotope Analysis of Migration at Two Chacoan Outliers in the Middle San Juan Region. Biogeochemistry is well positioned to contribute to the recent resurgence of migration analyses in the American Southwest. Previous bioarchaeological analyses of two Chacoan outliers located near Farmington, New Mexico, the Tommy Site (PI-PII) and the Mine Canyon Site (PIII) have indicated that the inhabitants of the Mine Canyon Site were not of ancestral Puebloan origins. Here, strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) from human molars are compared with the local isotopic ratio to identify migrants at both sites. The likely presence of migrant individuals, particularly at the PIII Mine Canyon Site, has significant implications for post-Chaco Canyon social organization in the Four Corners Region. Waller, Steven (Rock Art Acoustics) [60] Archaeoacoustic Techniques Lead to New Interpretations of the Thunderous Reverberation at Rock Art Sites Correlation between rock art placement and acoustics was documented, and initial research focused on standardized scientific techniques including quantitative sound level measurements of echoes and reverberation time. However, musical experimentation in reverberating environments of rock art sites, more along the lines of artistic expression than scientific study, resulted in the realization that percussion noises repeated in rapid succession can build up to the point that it sounds like thunder. This thunderous reverberation is culturally significant since major rock art themes are consistent with myths of thunder gods, including in the Old World hoofed animals and New World thunderbirds. Walling, Stanley [148] see Brokaw, Nick Wallman, Diane (University of South Carolina) [121] Subsistence and Slavery on a French Colonial Plantation: The Analysis of Faunal Remains from Habitation Crève Coeur, Martinique This paper integrates historical and archaeological data from a French colonial plantation, Habitation Crève Coeur, on the island of Martinique to examine slave subsistence. I present the results of zooarchaeological analyses as evidence of African and Afro-Caribbean slave foodways. Faunal remains are direct indicators of provisioning, eating, and community distribution of subsistence resources. Using these data I reconstruct the strategies and negotiations developed by the enslaved laborers to manipulate the constraints of their social and natural landscape. This study of slave lifeways and subsistence will provide novel insight into the understudied French colonial plantation system within the French West Indies. Walls, Matthew (University of Toronto) [159] Frozen Landscapes, Fluid Technologies: Inuit Kayak Hunting and the Perception of the Environment in Greenland Both archaeology and ethnography characterize Inuit

culture as having a strong dependence on local ecology, as well as complex spirituality. Especially prominent is the concept that every part of the environment is animated by spirits, and all actions, particularly those involved in hunting, invoke reciprocity between humans and their metaphysical surroundings. This paper explores the relationship between such perceptions of the environment and the manner in which it was experienced through traditional hunting technology. Research draws upon an ethnoarchaeological project that studies traditional kayaking in Greenland. Walsh, Justin (Louisiana State University) [242] Models for the Protection of Cultural Heritage in Space: An Internationalist Perspective The extraordinary historic importance of some sites and objects in space, combined with the special international nature of space law, makes an examination of multilateral efforts to manage earthbound cultural heritage worthwhile. Numerous international protocols exist to protect sites and artifacts from damage. Their implementation offers valuable lessons about the ways nation-states act (and do not act) in concert to preserve cultural heritage. The UNESCO Cultural Property Convention, applicable outer space treaties, the Antarctic Treaty, and the Law of the Sea will each be discussed with regard to their viability as models for protection of culturally significant material in space.

William Clewlow, Jr. The Project was carried out coincident with two significant transformations in the history of California archaeology: the dawning of the CRM era, and the paradigmatic shift that began to see the Chumash as politically and econonomically organized as chiefly polities. The role the ICRP played in these significant historical and anthropological developments is explored. Walsh, Rory (University of Oregon) [169] Experiments in morphology and taphonomy: Foxtail millet Innovative analyses of modern seeds provide valuable insights into archaeobotanical depositions. In this example from Neolithic north China, remains of foxtail millet are compared with modern reference material obtained from a variety of contexts. Modern foxtail is subjected to detailed morphometry before and after charring, illuminating the full range of morphology in a modern domesticate and addressing taphonomic issues. These experiments aid in the identification of archaeological foxtail, and statistical analysis reveals trends in feature type, settlement patterning, and site function.

Authenticity in the Convention`s Operational Guidelines has evolved and now includes an expanded definition that incorporates the Nara Document on Authenticity. Examples from archaeological World Heritage sites show that it often is not addressed explicitly in World Heritage nominations or management plans, despite the sites` concern for maintaining authenticity. In this paper I present an adaptable framework for considering authenticity that relates to the Nara Document and existing management plans. [259] First Chair Walz, Jonathan (Rollins College) [100] Seemingly Mundane Objects: Shell and Other Beads from Central, Coastwise East Africa, 750­1550 C.E. I report on beads of shell and other materials identified during survey and excavations in the lower Pangani (Ruvu) Basin, Tanzania. Locally produced beads --for instance, perforated discs made from the shells of African landsnails--challenge extant narratives about connectivity among regional populations during the later Iron Age (especially 900-1250 C.E.). These seemingly mundane objects provide critical insights about craft production, interaction, and shifting political economies in lowland northeastern Tanzania and wider eastern Africa. Wambach, Thomas (Indiana University of Pennsylvania) [209] Firing Techniques and their Effects on Susquehannock Ceramic Vessels Although archaeologists have generated considerable descriptive data on the structure of Susquehannock and other Late Prehistoric/Proto-historic ceramic vessels, there is a lack of information on the manufacture and production of these ceramics especially concerning the details of possible firing processes and techniques. While archaeological research appears to indicate that open pit firing was utilized by the Susquehannock, other firing processes, including above ground bonfiring and clamp firing, would produce similar general characteristics. The results of experiments testing and comparing the effects of open pit, bonfire, and clamp firing on recreated Shultz Incised Susquehannock vessels are presented and discussed. Wampler, Morgan (University of West Florida) [105] Alea Iacta Est: Evidence of Recreational Activities Aboard an 18th Century Spanish Frigate The Nuestra Senora del Rosario y Santiago Apostal sank off the coast of Santa Rosa Island in northwestern Florida in 1705. Archaeological investigation of this wreck site recovered numerous artifacts and faunal remains relating to the daily activities of the sailors. Other maritime studies of similar vessels have focused their attention on ship construction and the lifeways of the commanding officers. In order to understand the daily recreational activities of the sailors aboard this frigate, analysis was undertaken on the various gaming pieces and compared with remains from other wrecks of this period to assess both ethnicity and status.

Warmlander, Sebastian, Michael Neiss (Uppsala University, Sweden) and Sabrina Sholts (UC Berkeley) [146] 3D-model Analysis of Scandinavian Viking Age Brooches Surface 3D-models of excavated Scandinavian VikingAge brass brooches were created with a NextEngine laser scanner. Using RapidWorks 3D software, the digital models of the brooches were investigated in ways not feasible for the solid objects, including digital assembling of broken objects, distance measurements between select brooch landmarks, comparisons of size and volume, investigations of tool-marks, and false-colour imaging to help identify stylistic patterns. As a result, the temporal relation between the objects was established. Furthermore, some brooches display similarities indicating that they originate from the same workshop. The results illustrate how 3D analysis can help answer questions in artifact analysis. Warner, John (University of Kentucky) [125] An Examination of Architectural Continuity and Discontinuity from the North Coast of Peru The rich tradition of monumental architectural construction on the North Coast of Peru provides a longterm record of spatio-architectural development. Analysis over the long-term and across the region of architectural changes and continuities including the allocation of public and private space, access patterns, and the distribution of features typically associated with politico-ritual activity is critical for an interpretation of diachronic trends in North Coast sociopolitical organization. Concentrating upon the Late Formative Period site of Jatanca (Jequetepeque Valley), this paper will examine these architectural histories as a means to reconstruct longterm social processes related to incipient urbanization.

The excavations produced extensive assemblages associated with the town`s, prostitutes, the mill and railroad workers (and their saloons), and a small Chinese community. Taken as a whole it is an unprecedented collection of materials that tell a rich story about the lives of people who are largely invisible in the archaeological record of the Inland Northwest.

[234] In search of homelands: using strontium isotopes to identify biological markers of mobility in late prehistoric Portugal This study uses strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) in dental enamel from burial populations related to the Chalcolithic settlement site of Zambujal (c. 2800-1800 BC) to distinguish non-local individuals. Zambujal has long been considered a central location of population aggregation, craft production and trade during a time of increasing political centralization and social stratification until its eventually abandonment during the Bronze Age. While it is assumed that population migration and long distance trade played an important role in the region`s development, little is known about the migration patterns of individuals or groups. Directions for further study are discussed. Waterman, Anna [234] see Moore, Sara G. Waters, Michael (Texas A & M University) [155] Clovis Chronology and Origins Radiocarbon dates show that Clovis flourished during a narrow time interval during the late Pleistocene. Evidence from North America shows that Clovis originated south of the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets.

Watson, James (Arizona State Museum, University of Arizona) [143] Distances in Space and Time: Issues with a Mortuary Database of the First Farmers in the Southern Southwest This paper describes issues associated with the construction of a biocultural database from samples of the earliest farmers from the southern Southwest and northwest Mexico. Currently over a dozen archaeological sites dating to the Early Agricultural period (circa 1,600 B.C.-A.D. 150) have produced a large sample of mortuary features (n=413). These samples, and thereby the data, face unique challenges in interpretation compared to similar large data sets in that the materials (sites, features, and individuals) are geographically and temporally distant from each other; they are separated by over 150 linear miles and span almost 2,000 years of cultural development. Watson, James [147] see Cruz Guzmán, Carlos [237] see Fields, Misty Watson, Karen (California State University Sacramento) [96] Identifying Factors that Influence Choice of Stone for the Manufacture and Usage of Maize-Grinding Tools in Ancient Mexico Knowing what factors influenced pre-hispanic people`s choice of raw materials for maize-grinding tools is important in increasing our understanding of maize preparation intensification and changes in patterns of social, economic, and political development. In this paper, I identify factors that apparently influenced the choice of stone for the manufacture and usage of maizegrinding tools in ancient Mexico. I analyze data from several collections in three areas of Central Mexico: 1) the Mezquital Valley in Hidalgo, 2) the Apizaco region in Tlaxcala, and 3) the Teotihuacan Valley, Mexico. Wattenmaker, Patricia (University of Virginia) [198] Celebrating Abundance, Creating Scarcity: Ancient Mesopotamian Surplus Economies Challenges to the model of despotic rule in early state societies complicate the question of why households and communities intensified production in support of ancient polities. To better understand intensified surplus production in ancient Mesopotamia, this paper considers the symbolism associated with surpluses, as well as the ways that surpluses were utilized in various sectors of society. An analysis of storage facilities, their locations and contents, combined with insights from written records, suggests some of the ways that motivations for surplus production were embedded in social and ritual, as well as economic and political, realms of society. Watts, Christopher (Royal Ontario Museum) [55] Points of passage/points of view: Iroquoian animal effigy pipes and the crossing of corporeal borders As works of artistic merit, Iroquoian animal effigy pipes have captivated Northeastern archaeologists and other scholars since the late nineteenth century. In reviewing the various mammalian, avian, amphibian and other animal forms associated with these pipes, archaeologists typically alight on their sociopolitical or symbolic significance among Iroquoian groups. I seek to extend

this discussion by suggesting that the use of animal effigy pipes, in concert with the act of tobacco smoking, would have permitted a corporeal/perspectival shift in keeping with notions of a human/animal kinship, shared embodiment and relational ontology within an Iroquoian worldview.

Excavations exposed a limited portion of two roomblocks, revealing three masonry structures built into the post occupational fill of three original masonry structures. Separating these two episodes of occupation was a time span of less than a generation and a buildup of two plus meters of sediment deposition.

Foraging to Farming in the Near East Increased predictability and low dietary risk are primary features of established plant agriculture, the earliest stages of plant domestication processes was likely a high-risk enterprise characterized by fluctuating availability of cultivars as foragers first experimented with plant manipulation. Wild tubers, an important, but often overlooked, food source regularly, may have served as an important dietary supplement that afforded first cultivators the opportunity to pursue the potentially risky experiment of food production. Here, we present analyses of starch remains recovered from Pre-Pottery Neolithic A el-Hemmeh, Jordan, in order to explore the role of tubers in the transition from foraging to farming.

Submerged Prehistoric Sites on the Outer Continental Shelf, Gulf of Mexico Over the past three decades, technologies have developed that permit the mapping of submerged paleolandscapes on the world`s continental shelves plus the identification of locations that might contain preserved prehistoric cultural deposits. The examination of these potential site locations is typically made difficult because they are submerged and commonly buried. The use of core samples from submerged and buried sites to identify cultural deposits is discussed. Techniques drawn from geology and sedimentology are used to identify the macro- and micro-properties that characterize cultural deposits and distinguish them from natural sedimentary facies anticipated on the Gulf of Mexico`s continental shelf. Weir, Andrew (CCRG, Inc.) [80] Great Lakes, Harbors, Breakwaters, and Piers...oh my! Under the direction of John Milner and Associates, and for the U.S. Corps of Engineers (USACE), Commonwealth Cultural Resources Group, Inc. (CCRG) documented 26 sites in the USACE Detroit District. This effort, which occurred between January and September, 2010, resulted in the preparation of 19 National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nominations and eight Determinations of Eligibility (DOE) reports. These NRHP nominations and DOE reports were completed for numerous canals, harbors, harbor facilities, and waterways throughout Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Weisman, Brent (University of South Florida) [130] Discussant Weismantel, Mary (Northwestern University) [24] Moche Ceramics as Political Actors Evidence such as painted representations of fishing lines, boats, clothing and weapons as personified, and formal parallels between human bodies and ceramic vessels, indicates that Moche was a society in which objects acted as subjects. As valuables placed in elite tombs, however, the ceramic vessels do more than just make ontological assertions about materiality; they are also political statements about lineage, inheritance, control of irrigated fields and rights to labor. They taught elite youth that living bodies were vessels for ancestral potency, and reinforced the power of the old over the young, and the dead over the living.

However, the Cheqoq Archaeological Project in Cusco, Peru, has identified a ceramic production workshop linked to attached specialization in the Inka period. In this poster, evidence for ceramic finishing and

firing are examined, while comparing a secure to an ambiguous context using correspondence analysis. Implications for understanding elite economies in the developing imperial heartland are also investigated considering Cheqoq`s role in the royal estate. This probable workshop represents the first clear Inka core region ceramic production area identified to date. Welch, Daniel [80] see Lloyd, Timothy C. Welch, David (Int'l Archaeological Research Institute) and Judith R. McNeill (Int'l Archaeological Research Institute) [23] Late Prehistoric Landscape Transformations in the Phimai Region, Northeast Thailand Research in the Phimai region has focused on regional site surveys in diverse environmental zones. These surveys indicate expansion of settlement into new ecological zones, agricultural intensification, and growth in the number and size of settlements in the late prehistoric period. Data on late prehistoric environmental alterations and possible climatic changes from geoarchaeological investigations help explain the late prehistoric landscape, settlement pattern, and agricultural transformations. Both agricultural intensification and construction of moats around settlements may in part be responses to climate changes that affected the regional availability of water. Welch, John (Simon Fraser University) and Neal Ferris (U Western Ontario) [197] Making a Sustainable Archaeology Our vision of activist archaeology entails shifts in motivations for, process of, and products from CRM and academic research. We argue for transitions: from intradisciplinary drivers toward harmonization of research and societal interests; from an extractive conceptualization of archaeology toward an additive or servant culture of practice; and from a primary focus on salvage and narrowly defined research goals toward the perpetuation of cultural heritage, broadly defined. These shifts and applications of sustainable design principles outline a sustainable archaeology in which spectra of values embedded in the archaeological record are conserved and communities are recognized as the true cultural resources. Wells, E. Christian (University of South Florida) [198] Archaeological Perspectives on Surplus Capture in Contrasting Modes of Religiosity In this paper I examine archaeological data from New World complex societies to consider the relationship between surplus labor and religiosity. Using Harvey Whitehouse`s cognitive theory of alternate modes of religiosity, which seeks to explain how people at different social scales express and experience cosmological beliefs, I suggest that we should expect to find meaningful contrasts in how surplus labor is activated between imagistic (behavior involving sensory arousal) and doctrinal (behavior involving patterned repetition) modes of religious experience. I argue that archaeologists providing deep-time perspectives on material engagement can contribute to understanding how ritual performance motivates economic change.

Over the course of several seasons, powered by summer field schools, their focus changed from prehistoric settlement patterns to the documentation and interpretation of 19th century Shoshoni habitation sites. At the time there were few models for the study of historic period Native American sites, so theories and methods, some from prehistoric archaeology, were tried and abandoned. As the Grass Valley researchers slowly developed their own models, they produced significant publications and influenced the work of others. As Billy himself characterized it in 1978, the project became a series of particularistic studies that will someday make a whole. More than 30 years later, it is still not a whole, but our studies and our understanding continue to evolve.

Modern archaeology finds itself constructing parks, running community development projects and developing public educational programs. This broader mission serves to advance archaeology`s public profile while also passing on knowledge gleaned from archaeology to a wider audience.

Werness, Maline (St. Edward's University) [102] Space Men: Patrons` and Artists` Use of Ceramic Space to Construct Ideology Patrons and artists who created the Chocholá style, a Late Classic northern Maya luxury ware, chose busts of young lords set against deeply carved backgrounds framed by scrolls more often than any other subject. The three-dimensional presentation of space developed in the ceramic medium functions on several levels. First, artists created unique sets of relationships that define the whole corpus and project a specific, Chocholá identity. Second, they literally imbedded ideological messages in pictorial constructs that revolve around the figure of the young lord, implying a spatial continuum that acknowledges, yet remains separate from, the viewer`s world.

The first glimpse of an answer comes from the site of Malata, a terminal prehispanic village and early colonial mission in the southern Peruvian highlands. Comparison of domestic assemblages dating to the first post-conquest generation shows spatial and artifactual variation that point to corresponding differences in identity, political role, and production foci of distinct kinds of households: the probable quarters of a friar, an elite indigenous household, and a non-elite household engaged in a variety of production activities.

Wesp, Julie (UC Berkeley) [16] Embodied Identity: examining gender through occupational analyses The human body is a central component for understanding the lived experiences of individuals. Throughout normal development, our bodies are continually shaped by biological as well as social factors. Repetitive activity, such as differential muscle use, stimulates the formation of new bone and changes in the cross sectional morphology. Since gender is one of the most significant social structuring principles, differential activity between genders can be suggested. Thus, it is from these socially acceptable activities that, through life, manifest themselves biologically, that one can begin to make inferences about gendered individuals and engendered activities from archaeological skeletal remains.

During Late Nasca, there was a decentralization of regional power and an aggregation of people into much larger settlements. The results of test excavations in five sectors of Cocahuischo suggest differential access to high status and exotic goods during Late Nasca.

Whelan, Carly (UC Davis) [57] Prehistoric Patterns of Mobility and Trade in the Sierra Nevada Foothills The results of lithic raw material sourcing analysis can be used to reconstruct prehistoric mobility and trade patterns. Using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry, I have sourced obsidian artifacts from ten prehistoric sites that span more than 5000 years of hunter-gatherer occupation in the western Sierra Nevada foothills of California. The results of the analysis reveal temporal and spatial differences among the sites in the obsidian sources represented in their assemblages. This suggests that the people of the region underwent a diachronic change in mobility pattern and increased their participation in obsidian trade networks with groups east of the Sierra Nevada.

[263] Short-term Ecological Consequences of Initial Human Occupation of the Punta Gorda Rockshelter The Punta Gorda Rockshelter on the north coast of California contained a narrow 2.5 meter tall stratified shell midden deposit dating to a tight time span between 670 and 610 cal BP. The age of the site places it at the beginning of the California Athabaskan spread into Humboldt County--the first intensive use of coastal environments on record. Therefore, the deposit provides not only a glimpse into the historical ecology of the north coast of California, but data from the site document the initial effects of intensive human foraging in a previously lightly-occupied coastal strand.

The study of archaeological households enables investigators to situate the microscale of everyday life within larger economic and political contexts. This poster examines the economic organization of a single household (Operation 11) at the ancient Maya Medicinal Trail Site. Analysis of these remains shows that the primary economic activity of this ancient household was agriculture. Secondary economic activities could not be definitively discerned.

Whitby, Wendy (University of Central Lancashire, UK) [260] Cache Caves: A New Perspective on the Interior Landscape of South-central California The interior region of south-central California is a landscape of sandstone canyons, oak groves, and grassland potreros. Cache caves, hidden throughout this landscape, contain an exceptional collection of artifacts such as basketry and feather skirts. These sites appear to have functioned in a number of ways, in collection and storage of raw materials, in storage/concealment of ceremonial and ritual objects, and in association with rock-art activities.

This study integrates groundstone analysis with geologic sourcing by studying manos and metates at Petrified Forest National Park. A narrow bed of conglomerate sandstone outcrops in a small number of highly localized areas within the park.

Teotihuacan was a cosmopolitan city that depended on immigration for maintenance and expansion of its population . We compare marriage patterns, economic and social roles of women living in neighborhoods of differing ethnic composition and examine their relationship to social identity and the needs of the state. It may not have been uncommon for women to have valued social roles and/or high status. At Tlailotlacan, a Zapotec enclave, the maintenance of ethnic identity might have been attributed largely to women, who were gatekeepers of enculturation and frequently moved across the landscape, even while pregnant. At the Merchants` Barrio, a residential collection of traders who had origins in several parts of Mesoamerica, it is apparent that some immigrant women were able to maintain or achieve high status.

White, Paul (University of Alaska Anchorage) [166] Timbisha Shoshone Historic Landscapes Project: A Negotiation of Tribal and National Park "Scapes" An archaeological survey of an historic pinyon camp in Death Valley, California, in May 2010, sought to extend cooperative management efforts between the Timbisha Shoshone tribe and the National Park Service (NPS). Designed in the interests of ongoing resource protection efforts and desires for cultural preservation, this pilot project came to meet two seemingly contradictory ends, 1) the creation of a detailed archaeological database shared between the tribe and the NPS and, 2), the documentation of site-specific, sometimes artifactspecific, knowledge to remain with the tribe. This paper discusses findings from the collaborative research process. Whitehead, William (Ripon College) [35] Paleoethnobotany at Cerro Mejia, a Middle Horizon site the Moquegua, Peru region The botanical remains from Cerro Mejia will be presented, showing the species, quantities, distribution across the site. Site formation processes, behavioural patterns, and local activities combine to produce an assemblage that is much different than the other sites in the region that have been investigated to date. The analysis and collection methods will be highlighted showing the power and utility of performing intensive, digital documentation of museum collections. The final analysis of Cerro Mejia will complement and be compared to other Middle Horizon sites from Peru and Bolivia. Whitley, Catrina (Office of Archaeological Studies, Museum of NM) [37] Ash And Smoke: Classic And Coalition Mortuary Ritual In The Northern Rio Grande Analysis of Taos Valley mortuary practices (A.D. 12001320) revealed distinct methods for burying the deceased. This paper explores variation between Taos Valley Coalition Period mortuary practices and Northern Rio Grande Classic Period mortuary practices, addressing issues of mortuary ritual continuity and change during this period of social upheaval. Since mortuary ritual is conservative, alterations are rare and migrating groups would probably have continued these important traditions in their new communities. Additionally, this study discusses the efficacy of mortuary practices and ritual in the Northern Rio Grande as a means to identify immigrants. Whitley, David (ASM Affiliates, Inc.) [230] Matters of Fact and Matters of Fiction: Epistemology and Ontology in the Use of Indigenous Knowledge for Rock Art Interpretation Few research topics have been more controversial than rock art interpretation. Although traditionally discussed in empirical terms, the use of indigenous knowledge in rock art interpretation involves epistemological, ontological and methodological commitments that are usually overlooked. Interpretations of the attribution of Great Basin rock art to the actions of spirits illustrate this point. Denial of the relevance of this attribution assumes that religious statements are literal in meaning, reflecting a fundamentalist view of religion. Global ethnography indicates instead that religious statements commonly

assume spiritual causality, and over a dozen Native American tribes attribute the origin of rock art to spirits. Whitley, David [48] see Whitley, Tamara K. Whitley, Tamara (Bureau of Land Management) and David Whitley (ASM Affiliates, Inc.) [48] Visions Past and Present in Native California Few aspects of California archaeology are more remarkable, or more central to Native American consultation, than its rock art. Once thought entirely prehistoric and therefore disconnected from ethnographic peoples, recent studies instead demonstrate continuities in belief and the continued relevance of these sites to contemporary tribes. While archaeological interpretations of the art change periodically, Native California commentary has been consistent for over a century. Case studies from eastern and south-central California, and the Sierra Nevada, illustrate these continuities in belief and ritual systems, and their relevance to site management. Whitley, Thomas (Brockington and Associates, Inc.) [64] Diet and the Landscape: Modeling the Prehistoric Economies of the Georgia Coast (4500 to 300 BP). Using a combination of 15 environmental variables and 37 forage categories in 11 counties of Coastal Georgia, this study covers nearly 2 million hectares and represents a series of GIS models; for habitats, available calories, and returned calories. The resultant surfaces were used to develop both predictive and interpretive models of prehistoric economics, and represent both the diachronic and spatial distribution of potential energy sources in the environment. The results allow a great deal of insight into our understanding of how forage categories were utilized, competed for, and how they contributed to the surplus energy available for nonsubsistence behaviors. Whitley, Thomas [80] see Majewski, Teresita Whitlow, Raymond (SUNY Buffalo) [115] The Geography of Cucuteni-Ariusd sites and the role of the Eastern Carpathian Mountains in the Romanian Eneolithic Mountains present certain geographic challenges and affordances to the populations living near or among them. During the Eneolithic in Romania, the CucuteniAriusd culture straddled the Eastern Carpathian Mountains, though the majority of sites were located outside of the mountains proper. The single known exception is the Eneolithic settlement at Pauleni, which is located at a higher elevation and deeper in the foothills than any neighboring Ariusd or Cucuteni settlement. Through the use of GIS models, the location and local landscape of Pauleni is compared with nearby Ariusd and Cucuteni settlements, and the importance of proximity to mountain passes is considered. Whitridge, Peter (Memorial University of Newfoundland) [153] On the track of the track: human and animal paths in the Arctic Maps, including electronic ones, represent powerful tools for manipulating spatial information. They are anticipated, archaeologically, by actual trails and roads, which are

also deliberate materializations of travel routes and spatial knowledge, and impose a similarly abstract, cartographic sensibility on the landscape. Trails, however, are not a human invention. The North American Arctic has few paths and fewer roads, but is nonetheless dissected by animal travel routes, some deeply incised by millennia of animal travel, and many also traveled by human hunters. The overlap between human and animal trail creation and use invites us to re-problematize the human-animal divide. Whittaker, John (Grinnell College) [84] Discussant Whittington, Stephen (Wake Forest University) [51] Intersections of Archaeology and History at Teozacoalco in the Mixteca Alta The dynastic history of Teozacoalco appears in various Mixtec codices and, most importantly, on the Mapa de Teozacoalco from the 1570s. Besides identifying royal couples and their offspring, these documents also provide clues about Teozacoalco`s relationship with other Mixtec polities and the Spanish, its physical movement from a mountaintop to its present location, and the roles outsiders played in founding and maintaining its dynasties. Historical information from documents and archaeological data from surveys and excavations complement each other and help to expose Teozacoalco`s importance within the complex political and geographic landscape of the Mixteca Alta.

A three-year project is investigating a range of isotopes (strontium, carbon, nitrogen, calcium and oxygen) from humans and animals, and selected aspects of osteology, to incorporate the results with a detailed reconsideration of their archaeological context. The main objectives are to explore patterns of diet, health and movement and to facilitate the investigation of diverse lifeways in the central European LBK (broadly, in the second half of the sixth millennium cal BC).

Wiederhold, Jim and Charlotte Pevny (R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates, Inc) [59] Toward the Standardization of Lithic Microwear Analysis: Fundamental Theories and Principles Interpretations of tool use must be based on reliable data and successful microwear analyses must incorporate concepts fundamental to lithic studies. Site context, taphonomy, fracture mechanics, and experimental research provide a foundation to explore actions associated with tool use and post-depositional processes. An analytical approach including low and high magnifications and the principles of tribology offer a means to detect microwear and determine tool motion. These basics served as the cornerstone of analyses of lithic material recovered from pre-Clovis contexts at the Buttermilk Creek/Friedkin site in Texas, allowing identification of cultural use and inferences about kinematic motion and worked material. Wiemann, Michael [265] see McKillop, Heather Wieser, Anna (University of Arkansas) [26] Geoarchaeology of Former Marshland in the Lower Orontes River Valley, Syria Geoarchaeological research at Tell Qarqur indicates a complex and changing relationship between humans and the environment in the lower Orontes River valley of northwestern Syria. Examination of satellite imagery and historical maps reveals the location of an Orontes paleochannel and former marshland, respectively. Augering of these sediments in correlation with GIS mapping of archaeological sites in the valley contributes to the reconstruction of depositional environments. Results demonstrate the presence of a seasonal marsh in the valley prior to channeling of the river in the 1950s as well as variation in the location and size of the marsh through time. Wiewall, Darcy (Antelope Valley College) and Linda Howie (The University of Western Ontario) [190] New Insights on the Mercantile Economy at Lamanai, Belize during the Terminal Postclassic to Early Colonial Periods The Postclassic period in the Maya area has been characterized as a time of the development of a commercial-oriented society with expanded international markets and maritime trade network. A number of Lowland sites have identified a trend toward increasing uniformity in material assemblages reflecting the growth of mercantile market activity. In direct contrast to this trend of uniformity, investigation of residential areas at Lamanai identifies a general pattern of continued heterogeneity. Drawing from microscopic analysis of the ceramics, evidence of copper metallurgy, architecture and lithic material, this paper provides insight into local and regional patterns economic activity and interaction. Wiewel, Rebecca (University of Arkansas) [187] Regional Interaction in the Central Arkansas River Valley: Stylistic and Compositional Analysis of Carden Bottoms Phase Ceramics The ongoing CARV project seeks to elucidate the regional dynamics of Carden Bottoms phase communities living in the central Arkansas River valley. This paper discusses the results of stylistic analyses of

Carden Bottoms phase ceramics and planned provenance studies, utilizing neutron activation analysis. Stylistic analyses have identified three broad categories of wares: local, imported (Mississippian and Caddoan), and hybrid wares produced locally using design elements from other ceramic traditions. Compositional analysis will yield data that can be used to explore the degree of regional interaction present at Carden Bottoms sites and characterize the nature, strength, and direction of these interactions.

The extent and type of interaction is unclear. This paper will examine the continuity and changes of ceramic and bone tools seen through this transition period, at the site of El Rayo. Special attention will be given to the three style variations of net sinkers found at the site and the use of bone fish hooks throughout time.

[211] Roman Catholic Rock Art Traditions of Northern New Mexico Although the primary focus of rock art research in northern New Mexico has been on Puebloan and Archaic material, the area also offers a rich body of colonial era petroglyphs that are strongly influenced by Roman Catholic iconographies. This poster presents the findings of a recent survey along the Rio Grande gorge that seeks to better understand the local Catholic rock art tradition and the sacred landscape which framed it. As the results of this research suggest, it is increasingly difficult to sustain a strict dichotomy between Catholic and Native American rock art traditions in the region. Wilkinson, K. [114] see Adler, Daniel S. Wilkinson, Patrick (University of Arkansas) and Marieka Arksey (British Museum) [124] Pachychilus as a Sub-local Climate Proxy in the Southern Maya Lowlands The ubiquitous Jute snail (Pachychilus) presents archaeologists and paleo-climatologist in the Maya Lowlands with a unique sub-local climate proxy. Because of the presence of Jute shells in both construction fill and in ceremonial context, it should be possible to track local climate change and to determine the correlation, if any, with site abandonment. By analyzing the ratio of stable oxygen isotopes found in the leading edges of the shells, it is possible to chart changes in water temperature in the Belize River, the natural habitat for the snails, over the span of occupation of sites in the valley. These temperature changes in the water indicate lower water levels in the river, increased ambient temperature, or both.

As such he was interviewed for ethnographic, linguistic and material culture information that he, the last Yahi, possessed. Recent reassessments, however, indicate outside influences on him, including presence of external ideas, words and material culture-- if not a different tribal affiliation. To examine this interpretation, we compare Ishi`s face and head measurements with those of other Northern California Natives. While documenting much variation within Native Californians,

our results support the more traditional identification of Ishi as a member of a Hokan- speaking rather than a Penutian- speaking group. Williams, David (University of Colorado at Boulder) [38] Identifying Change Through Time: Technological, Functional, and Exchange Analysis of Chipped Stone Artifacts from Coastal Oaxaca, Mexico This paper discusses the results of the analysis of over 5,000 obsidian artifacts from the Lower Río Verde Valley, Oaxaca, Mexico. Previous lithic studies in the region have been minimal. This pilot study applies XRF sourcing, differences in manufacturing style and technique, and microwear analysis to better understand the changing political and social climates between the Early Formative (1800-800 BC) and Late Postclassic (AD 900-1522). Analyzed obsidian from over one dozen sites in the Lower Verde allows for a more complete archaeological understanding of domestic and political economies, trade networks, social connections, and daily activities in the region. Williams, Howard (University of Chester) [226] Burn Up or Fade Away? The Context of Cremation in Early Medieval Europe For early medieval north-west Europe and Scandinavia, cremation practices can be viewed as technologies of remembrance employed to commemorate by fiery transformation. Cremation was variously and selectively employed in mortuary contexts alongside other modes for disposing of the dead prior to and during conversion to Christianity. This paper examines archaeological case studies from Britain and southern Scandinavia showing how cremation's social meaning and commemorative efficacy shifted through fluctuating contextual association with other disposal methods. Williams, James (University of Pittsburgh) [54] Regional Survey and Communities in China The spatial characteristics of mobile communities present theoretical and methodological challenges. Modes of analyses can be tailored to address this. The methodologies and analyses presented will explore how to address the variation of community composition and the nature of communities. To explore these concepts relating to the nature of communities the paper will utilize the case of the Zhangwu region of Liaoning China in fieldwork proposed to begin in 2011. The conditions of the Zhangwu region require that a variety of community compositions be understood.

Several nodules were reduced by a single knapper in an effort to test the effects of the various factors. When previous nodule flake scars and type of hammer used are considered, the strength of the relationship between platform size and flake size is comparatively weaker. [257] First Chair

We review evidence for the procurement of monolithic stones from sandstone quarries in the local Kimsachata Mountains, and highlight new sourcing data for the acquisition of andesite and other igneous stone from quarries in the broader circumTiticaca Basin. Chronological changes in the acquisition of stone reveal increasingly broad spheres of procurement through time, with exotic igneous sources becoming pronounced later in Tiwanaku`s hegemony.

Williams, Sarah (Indiana University of Pennsylvania) [180] Prehistoric Deer Bones Tell Their Story: Investigating Deer and Human Behavior through Stable Carbon Isotope Analysis Stable carbon isotopic analysis can provide insight into hunting strategies once held by the Ancestral Pueblo located in the Dolores valley of southwestern Colorado. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) is abundant in the faunal assemblages, but how it was hunted is less clear. Acquisitions during logistical hunts or through hunting in gardens both have been proposed. Current examination of stable carbon isotopes of deer remains clarifies how many C3 versus C4 plants were in the deer diet. Over time a high C4 signature in the isotopes indicates garden hunting while a high C3 indicates logistical hunting in the Dolores sequence. Williams, Veronica (CONICET- UBA) and Maria B. Cremonte (CONICET/IDGYM) [68] Social Landscape During Inca Domination in Northwest Argentina Among the ways that the Inca Empire adopted to rule its territory included actions into ideological, economic, and political sphere which explain in part the diversity and disparity that the state presence reached. Constructions like roads, tampus, pukaras, administrative centers, storage buildings, agricultural works, among others, were common in the entire annexed areas, but it is evident that its architecture, dimensions, monumentality and spatial density show contrasting regional differences. New evidence regarding Inca occupation in Northwest Argentina shows different situations along the period of Inca conquest and domination itself. Williamson, Andrew [87] see Spencer, Alan C.

By the Florescent period, these designs became more regulated with the use of stamps in patterns of crosses, waves, animals, and humans. In the Later periods, after the migration of Central Mexican peoples into the region, some earlier Nicoyan designs were still present, but new stamped mat-weave patterns were introduced.

Macrobotanical trends seen elsewhere in central California indexing intensified acorn use followed by intensive small seed use, are present but muted along the river. Limited choices of relatively high-ranked nut crops along the river may have precipitated earlier intensive use of lower-ranked small seeds than in adjacent regions with access to the broad diversity of nuts in foothill localities.

[22] Experiment, Experience, and Lithic Analysis The foundational assumption of replication experiments is that experience and observations gained from attempts to make and use replicas of ancient objects leads to reliable knowledge of the manufacture and use of the targeted artifacts. Most truth claims made for ancient stone tools are entangled with experimental outcomes in some way, as are the methods for analyzing these artifacts. In recent years the epistemological dependency of lithic analysis on experiments has been challenged, and rightly so. We explore the debate over what experiments can and can`t do for lithic analysis. Woodson, M (Gila River Indian Community) [199] What We Do Not Know About the Impact of Flooding on Hohokam Irrigation Agriculture A common claim in studies of Hohokam irrigation agriculture is that flooding events were problematic or even disastrous for canal system infrastructure and for irrigators. The sources for these speculations include records of historic floods in Phoenix Basin, reconstructed stream flows based on tree-ring research, and the geological history of river environments. Yet we still do not know exactly how these landscape events affected Hohokam irrigation. In this paper I use recent evidence from the Middle Gila River Valley to examine the impact of discharge changes and streambed alterations on Hohokam canal systems and the populations living along the canals.

This paper investigates the use of dogs for traction by Inuit though analyses of faunal remains recovered at the sites of Uivak Point, Oakes Bay 1, and Koliktalik 6 (Nunatsiavut, Canada) and will focus on the use of tooth cementum to determine mortality profiles. This study is intended to reconstruct strategies of sled dog management, to gage the security of Inuit subsistence through the proxy of dog mortality, and to cast light on one means by which Inuit actively manipulated their biological environment. Workinger, Andrew [5] see Brzezinski, Jeffrey S. Worman, F. Scott (University of New Mexico) [37] Agricultural Landscapes of the Classic Period The widespread adoption of dry farming is considered a defining characteristic of the Classic Period in the Eastern Pueblo world. Recent research on the Caja del Rio Plateau and Albuquerque`s West Mesa provides insights into the range of sophisticated techniques used to make agriculture possible in upland areas. Investigations at Alameda and Chamisal Pueblos in the Rio Grande valley suggest that floodplain agriculture was widespread and highly productive at the same time. Patterns visible at the regional scale have implications for migration and social interaction and raise questions of

the relationship between site visibility and responses to climate change. [37] Second Organizer Wren, Linnea [102] see Nygard, Travis Wright, David (Universidad de Guanajuato) [21] The role of Otomí speakers in pre-Hispanic central Mexican society The participation of Otomí speakers in the multilingual society of central Mexico has traditionally been underestimated. In recent years the role of the Otomí in this region has been reexamined. In this paper a transdisciplinary approach is used to bring together linguistic, archaeological, historical and epigraphic evidence, showing that the Otomí were among the most ancient sedentary inhabitants of the central valleys of Mexico, participating fully in cultural developments throughout the pre-Hispanic era.

Andrew Darling (Gila River Indian Community), Craig Fertelmes (Gila River Indian Community/Arizona State University), Steven Forman (University of Illinois at Chicago) and Michael Waters (Texas A&M University) [139] The Archaeology of Dust: Historical Roots of a Modern Problem Wind is respected by the O`odham of Arizona for its role in bringing rain (juhki) and destructive dust storms (civar lick/vomat huh vuhl). However, airborne sediments pose health and subsistence risks to humans occupying desert landscapes. In the modern world, government regulations mandate dust abatement procedures across broad geographic regions but rarely do they consider that eolian activity has always been a part of human existence in dryland environments. Using sediment chemistry, OSL dating and XRF analyses, the Gila River Indian Community in south-central Arizona has initiated a deep-time study to geomorphically contextualize and explore indigenous responses to aerosols.

However, scale is a key factor of interactionist perspectives based in immobile communities.

Wright, Lori [56] see Trask, Willa R. Wright, Patti (University of Missouri--St. Louis) [111] Formation Processes of Carbonized Seed Assemblages Cultural and noncultural processes contribute to the survival of plants remains and to their incorporation in the archaeological record. In this paper, I discuss carbonization and how it differentially influences the preservation of starchy and oily seeds especially those of the plants, chenopod, maize, sumpweed, and sunflower. I present information on how the carbonized remains of these seeds survive non-cultural processes such changes in temperature, moisture, and pH, and analytical process such as flotation. Ultimately, I indicate how formation processes affect the relative proportions of starchy and oily seeds and, in turn, interpretations of plant use. Wriston, Teresa (University of Nevada, Reno) and Gary Haynes (University of Nevada, Reno) [4] Geoarchaeological Investigations in Northwestern Zimbabwe Paleoenvironmental reconstructions for southern Africa are challenging due to a poor understanding of climatic teleconnections and how they have changed over time. In order to decipher these dynamics, detailed proxy data of different types and from different locations is necessary. Recent geoarchaeological investigations in Hwange National Park provide one piece of this puzzle for the mid-to-late Holocene in northwestern Zimbabwe. These investigations include description and sampling of sediments and soils exposed in river cutbanks and archaeological rockshelters that reflect regional environmental changes during the transition from hunters-and-gatherers to farmers and pastoralists. Wriston, Teresa [60] see Hutson, Jarod M. Wrobel, Gabriel (University of Mississippi), Christophe Helmke (University of Copenhagen) and Jaime J. Awe (National Institute of Culture and History) [56] Caves as Tombs: A Bioarchaeological Example from the Maya Cave Site of Je`reftheel, Caves Branch, Belize Je`reftheel, a small, unlooted cave in central Belize, contained the remains of approximately 20 individuals in various states of articulation and spread across seven separate features. A contextual analysis of the various deposits demonstrates that many aspects of the site`s mortuary use closely parallel elite funerary ritual focused on tombs, and thus the placement of human remains in Je`reftheel is consistent with an interpretation of veneration, rather than sacrifice. This explanation is discussed in relation to current models of Late-Terminal Classic [56] First Chair Wrobel, Gabriel [56] see Michael, Amy [204] see Shelton, Rebecca L. Wu, Chia-Chin (University College London) and Christine Hastorf (University of California, Berkeley) [35] Identification of tuber processing methods: parenchyma studies from Fromative Chiripa, Bolivia

Using a refined tuber identification method, we identify dried stored tubers and various cooked evidence through microscopic analysis of tissue damage patterns in parenchymous tissue. The tuber remains were recovered from the Formative site of Chiripa, an early center on the shores of Lake Titicaca. These fragments are associated with an emerging agricultural society in which highland tuber domesticates, especially the potato Solanum, were important. The tuber processing identification method outlined and applied to specimens in this paper provides insights into food preparation as well as the use of space at this pre-Tiwanaku community. Wulffen, Jennifer (University of Illinois Chicago) [105] Shell concentrations at Caballete, Norte Chico, Peru:Mapping temporary camp sites in the Late Archiac Caballete is a large Late Archaic (3000 ­ 1800 B.C.) coastal site in the Fortaleza Valley, Peru. It contains large mounds with associated circular plazas and stone housing complexes indicative of a complex society. An informal survey of the large open area in front of the mounds documented a broad distribution of shell fragments, and test units in 2006 and 2008 revealed temporary occupations within it. In 2010 a survey was conducted to map the distribution of shell concentrations extending from the mound area to the base of the surrounding foothills. The poster presents the results of that survey. Wygal, Brian (Adelphi University) [231] Testing the Mammoth Refugia Hypothesis in the Central Alaska Range The mammoth steppe undoubtedly fostered the expansion of hunter-gatherers into interior Alaska during the turbulent terminal Pleistocene. Archaeologists have long hypothesized that as the first human groups arrived in eastern Beringia, the rapidly declining mammoth steppe forced late Pleistocene megafauna into mammoth refugia such as in the foothills of the Central Alaska Range. Recent surveys tested the hypothesis that prehistoric hunters converged on large game species in these once glaciated alpine zones. Undated surface finds, meat caches, hunting blinds, and buried biface production sites, one yielding a date of 12,400 cal BP, indicate a lengthy prehistoric use of these areas. Xie, Liye (the University of Arizona) [69] Why Bones?: Worked Scapulae from the Lower Yangzi River, China Worked scapulae, which are assumed to be agricultural implements, have been recovered from archaeological sites in Asia, Europe and the Americas, and yet their distribution seems to be restricted to only certain regions in each continent. To understand why bone was preferred as a raw material for making these tools, the author closely examined worked scapulae (8000-5000 BCE) from the lower Yangzi River, and conducted replicative and functional experiments to compare performance characteristics between worked scapulae and stone shovels and hoes.

rapidly in the 8th century A.D., eclipsing its much older neighbors and presumed rivals. This expansion apparently corresponds with Xunantunich`s transformation from an autonomous polity to a province directly ruled by the larger kingdom of Naranjo. A new palace was built to house the truncated ruling court entailed by that new political arrangement. In the mid-8th century, however, the palace was sacked and ritually terminated. This event was followed by a return to political autonomy by the turn of the 9th century. This paper details the archaeological evidence supporting this political history.

Yao, Alice (University of Toronto) [23] Shellmounds in the Heartland of the Dian polity Investigations on the Bronze Age civilizations of Yunnan, China have until recently focused on the excavation of large cemetery sites. The locations of the settlements associated with these complex political entities have largely eluded archaeologists. This paper presents preliminary results identifying the Bronze Age settlement pattern from the Lake Dian basin, which features intensive occupation of lowland floodplains and swamps in a highly unique ecosystem.

Shane Miller (University of Arizona) [216] Archaeological Information System Standard Design Concepts Archaeologists are collecting vast amounts of digital data that would be unbelievable a decade ago. Beyond descriptive artifact databases, archaeologists are managing artifact photos, field photos, scanned forms and sketch maps, geographic layers, geophysical data, etc. This paper presents a design and implementation strategy that incorporates digital objects and archaeological data into a distributed Information System (IS). The is a flexible paradigmatic platform that allows autonomous data management, but also provides a technology-independent system that facilitates the sharing and publishing of archaeological information. The system design is demonstrated through the application on several archaeological projects. Yeske, Kate (Colorado State University, CEMML) and Edmund Gaines (Colorado State University, CEMML) [181] Prehistoric Land Use of a Vegetated Dune Field, Tanana Flats, Interior Alaska The northwestern portion of the Tanana Flats, Interior Alaska, contains a ~19,000 acre vegetated dune field. Archaeological surveys conducted by Colorado State University, CEMML, during the 2009 and 2010 field seasons identified 40 prehistoric sites in this setting. This group represents one of the densest clusters of

prehistoric sites known in subarctic Alaska. Recovered assemblages consist of stone tools and debitage reflective of short-term, seasonal hunter-gatherer campsites and activity areas. Radiocarbon dating and stratigraphic position indicate nomadic use of the area beginning in the early Holocene and continuing through the proto-historic period. Yeske, Kate [181] see Gaines, Edmund P. Yesner, David (University of Alaska Anchorage) and Norman Easton (Yukon College) [124] Archaeology and Paleoecology of Eastern Beringia, 1990-2010 Twenty years of research in interior Alaska and ten in the Alaska/Yukon borderlands have now produced a clearer idea of spatial and temporal variations in humanenvironmental relations among the first colonizers of the North American landscape. It is now clear that lateglacial environmental changes, on the one hand, and hypsithermal changes on the other, produced more profound effects than the Younger Dryas period. Finegrained stratigraphic analyses of faunal remains from key sites with organic preservation reveal regional and temporal differences in climatic conditions, available taxa, settlement patterns, and links with artifact assemblages, with implications for peopling of the Americas. [124] First Chair Yoder, David (William Self Associates) [203] Invisible Culture: The Use of Soft X-Ray Radiography in Perishable Artifacts The research potential of some artifacts has been hampered by our inability to observe hidden features. This problem can be solved in part by the use of soft Xray radiography, an archaeometric method that enables the viewing of internal elements that are sometimes unavailable through physical inspection alone. Multiple case studies of perishable specimens from throughout the Great Basin and Southwest are presented to demonstrate the utility of this technique. Results show that while not suited for every situation, soft X-ray radiography can be a powerful, non-destructive, and inexpensive tool in the analysis and interpretation of many types of perishables.

[94] From Warner Valley to Honey Lake: Middle Archaic Logistical Mobility in the Western Great Basin Targeted provisioning within a pattern of logistical mobility is a hallmark of the Middle Archaic in the western Great Basin. Discrete components at Honey Lake in northwestern Nevada provide datasets for testing this statement and provide openings for addressing implications of seemingly sub-optimal behavior (e.g., prestige hunting) within a broader socio-economic system. Toolstone collection mirrors other provisioning activities and provides a structure for targeting resources that may not conform to expectations of optimality. These data have forced me outside my intellectual comfort zone, not a difficult push, but one that Don Fowler has consistently challenged and encouraged me to accept.

During this time, this relationship has changed from informant and crew member to collaborative partner. At the Homol`ovi Ruins State Park, recent collaborations have focused on public outreach projects and educational opportunities. This poster examines how archaeologists and Hopi tribal members worked together on two interpretive projects: a podcast audiotour of an ancestral Hopi Village and the construction of a traditional Hopi corn roasting pit. We also discuss the recent changes that have occurred with the closing of the Park. Young, Lisa [135] see Sampson, Christina Perry Young, Tatiana (PhD Candidate, Temple University) [131] Occupation and Abandonment of sites in the Cochuah Region, Quintana Roo, Mexico Occupation and Abandonment of sites in the Cochuah Region, Quintana Roo, Mexico The majority of sites in the Cochuah Region, Quintana Roo demonstrate a similar pattern of occupation and abandonment. The sites in the region were occupied during the Middle and Late Formative Periods, with considerable population increase throughout the Formative Period. Most sites in the vicinity experienced population decline and abandonment during the Early and Late Classic Periods, only to witness a peak of occupation during the Terminal Classic Period. What was the determining factor(s) of resettlement in the studied area: geological and ecological settings, environmental conditions or political and religious structures? Younger, John (University of Kansas) [47] Minoan-Mycenaean Sealstones: Understanding Chronology and Function Facilitated by the volumes of the Corpus der minoischen und mykenischen Siegel (Berlin 1960-2009), scholars studying Minoan and Mycenaean sealstones and sealings of the Aegean Bronze Age (ca. 2300-1300 BCE) have worked in two major areas: chronology and function. Chronology is now well understood through a process of creating a stylistic typology for seals that can be fixed in time through seals from stratigraphic

excavations. Understanding the function of seals relies on a detailed typology of sealings and their role in administration as witnessed by documents written in the three major Aegean scripts, Cretan Pictographic and Linear A and B.

The site`s buried cultural layer is situated within a stratigraphically sealed silt deposit, underlying grussy colluvial deposits. Excavation highlights include the discovery of a new hearth feature, additional lithic and bone artifacts, and a fluted point directly associated with charcoal and charred bone from the hearth. These appear to be stratigraphically associated with a previously excavated hearth feature dating to approximately 10,000 14C BP (11,500-12,000 cal BP).

Special attention is given to genderspecific organization of labor during periods of intensive fish harvest, and technological behavior associated with large scale processing practiced by aquatic-focused hunting and gathering peoples.

Se propone a partir del caso de Aguateca una centralización observada en el manejo de la materia prima de la pirita, su transformación y uso ritual. Su distribución restringida a contextos administrativos y residenciales le relaciona con un símbolo clave en la conformación del habitus gobernante, difícilmente intercambiable por otro tipo de objetos. Una comparación con el intercambio ritual de brazaletes en el Kula, y con el consumo ritual de sal entre los Baruya, nos provee de una idea general sobre los posibles significados sociales de la pirita dentro de las élites políticas mayas durante el clásico tardío. Zaragoza, Diana (INAH) [21] Los otomíes en la huasteca La Huasteca es sin duda uno de los sectores que conformaron Mesoamérica en época tardía. Su posición en la llamada frontera norte le confiere cualidades excepcionales; probando además, su prolongada secuencia cronológica y muchas de sus manifestaciones culturales indígenas han trascendido hasta nuestro tiempo. Aquí confluyeron muchas etnias las cuales, en el contexto arqueológico, son muy difíciles de determinar; sin embargo, existen ciertos indicadores que pueden relacionarlas. En esta presentación me dedicaré más al aspecto religioso de la región y el impacto que tuvieron los otomíes en ella. [21] First Chair Zaro, Gregory (University of Maine) [223] Agro-ecological management of intervalley landscapes on Peru`s arid south coast Recent archaeological and geological research on Peru`s arid south coast has highlighted the intensity of human occupation and land use beyond primary river drainages during the late Late Intermediate Period (A.D. 12001400). While human settlement was suitably positioned to take advantage of the rich maritime base, farming remained integral to the local subsistence economy within intervalley settings. This paper specifically addresses Chiribaya agro-ecological management of dispersed intervalley field systems, including terracing, irrigation, and soil properties. When treated in the context of global change, the study of ancient fields holds significant implications for sustainability, resilience, and coupled Earth-human systems. Zawadzka, Dagmara (Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM)) [60] Woodland critters great and small in Canadian Shield rock art Animals figure prominently in the spiritual beliefs of Algonquian-speaking peoples. Oral traditions abound with accounts of animal ­ human relations and animals are often invoked in ritual practices. Animals are considered other-than-human persons and various rituals accompany the hunting of certain animals such as bears. Though animals are such important elements in Algonquian peoples` beliefs, they do not figure prominently in their rock art. This paper will examine which animals are depicted in Canadian Shield rock art

and the reasons for their inclusion. Zborover, Danny (University of Calgary) [200] Archaeology, Ethnohistory, and EthnologyInterpretive Interfaces in the Chontalpa Historical Archaeology Project, Oaxaca The systematic integration of archaeological, documental, and ethnographic data sets was a hallmark of Thomas Charlton`s scholarship throughout the decades, while the interpretive interfaces outlined in his 1981 seminal article are still highly relevant to contemporary integrative research. Through a documentoriented archaeology combined with ethnographic data, the Chontalpa Historical Archaeology is examining the Chontal territorial narratives` in corroborative, complementary, and contrastive frameworks. By critically evaluating both indigenous and European perspectives, historical archaeology is further able to transform the image of the Chontalpa from a passive periphery into a dynamic player in the Mesoamerican arena, before and after the Spanish conquest. Zeanah, David (California State University, Sacramento), Douglas Bird (Stanford University), Rebecca Bliege Bird (Stanford University) and Brian Codding (Stanford University) [74] Anthropogenic Burning, Intensive Seed Exploitation and the Organization of Ground Stone Technology in Western Australia We propose that the late Holocene proliferation of ground stone tools through the Australian arid zone marked the onset of anthropogenic fire regimes. The effect of controlled burning was to disperse seed patches to catch unpredictable rainfall. Consequent transport costs made investments in ground stone technology worthwhile leading to curated, portable, specialized and cached milling equipment. Ground stone assemblages from Western Australia were analyzed to assess how well variability supports a link between intensive seed use and anthropogenic burning. Results of the study have implications for longstanding issues of seed intensification in both North America and Australia. Zedeño, Maria (University of Arizona) [18] Archaeology, Legitimacy, and the Contemporary Indian Nation Understanding the relationship between past peoples and present power is one of Don Fowler`s enduring legacies. Particularly compelling is his view of archaeology as a symbolic resource used to co-opt political power and to disenfranchise descendant populations. In three case studies from western North America I illustrate the evolution of sociopolitical ties between tribes and archaeological landscapes and objects since the establishment of reservations, and how these ties contribute to the consolidation of identity and power among contemporary native nations. I argue that archaeologists may strengthen native nations` legitimate rights to the past through the practice of indigenous archaeology.

the status quo coupled with the anal-retentive pursuit of its empirical underpinnings are traits shared by many UofM alum. While this contrarian approach may not always be comfortable, it can result in paradigmatic shifts in archaeological theory and practice. Here I give a few examples from my own work where this ingrained Michigonian characteristic has contributed to changes in the ways we both trace and explain agricultural origins in the Near East. Zegarra, Fredy Zegarra [269] see Rodriguez, David M. Zeitlin, Judith (University of Massachusetts Boston) [200] Authority and Representation in the Mesoamerican Past: Relating the Textual and Archaeological Records from Formative to Postconquest Times. North American historical archaeologists focus on the post-1492 globalized world, but it is a temporal perspective not shared across the Atlantic, where researchers may extend their reach back to the Roman imperial expansion. For Mesoamericanists, working in a region where Precolumbian societies produced their own graphic writing systems, bridging the dividing line formed by the Spanish Conquest enables an examination of changing relationships between the written word and the communities it addressed across multiple time periods. A sampling of these developments highlights the materiality of the text and its often ephemeral power over imperial subjects. Zelazo, Emilie (CSU Sacramento) [256] Resource Intensification in Central California: Evidence from the Sacramento River and Consumnes River Drainage Recent models of resource intensification in California argue for a decrease in foraging efficiency over the late Holocene for Northern and Central California. Causes of this decrease are understood to be the results of harvest pressure resulting from rising human populations and/or a decline in the absolute number of large mammals available due to environmental change. Faunal assemblages from Middle Period (2800 B.P. to 1200 B.P) and Late Period (1200 B.P. to 100 B.P.) sites located in the lower Cosumnes River drainage and the Sacramento River will be used as case examples.

matrix-supported conglomerates. Determining the external dose rate for mammalian teeth recovered from typical cave sediment always requires that some volumetric dosimetry be used to average out the effects of sediment inhomogeneity (lumpiness) and the thin layers typically found in archaeological contexts. At Smugglers`, two methods to calculate the volumetric dose contribution from éboulis and other lumps, and its effects on the calculated ages are reported here. Zhu, Tiequan (Sun Yat-sen University) [142] The Scientific Study on the Exported Porcelains from Xicun Kiln in Guangzhou Xicun kiln, located in Guangzhou, China, is a typical kiln that produces the exported porcelains during Song Dynasty (907-960AD). Using a series of experimental methods, including Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (EDXRF), Laser ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (La-ICPMS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman Spectroscopy (RS), samples were analyzed systemically. Based on the analysis, the technological and provenance characteristics of different types of porcelains (Celadon with the incised and carving flowers, Qingbai wares, Black porcelains, Colored porcelains) were discussed, including material exploitation, glazing, firing temperature, etc. This research has potential for revealing ancient ceramic trade across East and Southeast Asia. Zihlman, Adrienne (University of California, Santa Cruz) [16] Sex differences and gender roles: persisting issues in human evolution Reconstructions of early hominid social life prior to the 1970s portrayed males as the key to becoming human, through hunting and sharing meat; females, bonded to males, were dependent, inactive, and invisible. Women`s visibility in the evolutionary picture has been shorted lived, with Science articles (1981, 2009) giving prominence to males initially as provisioners of lettuce rather than meat, and now as care-takers. I review the history, question the fossil evidence, and draw on examples from recent textbooks. The profession has not progressed in its portrayal of women in evolution and may have even lost ground in the last decades. Zimansky, Paul (Stony Brook University) [258] Cultural Assimilation and Imperial Control in an Urartian City From c. 800 650 BC the Urartian empire constructed settlements in eastern Anatolia and populated them with captives taken in military campaigns. Excavations in the outer town at the center of Ayanis, Turkey, demonstrate that the level of imperial planning was uneven in the settlement area and while all of the inhabitants used artifacts associated with the imperial assemblage, there also many idiosyncrasies in individual households. The patterns will be compared with models of imperial-local interaction in the New World. Zimmerman, Larry (IUPUI/Eiteljorg Museum) [78] Discussant Zimmerman, Larry [197] see Singleton, Courtney E.

Zipper, Carl (Hamilton College) [208] Digging Deeper into the Campus Rd. Site: Excavation and Analysis of a 19th Century Farmstead The remains of 19th century farmsteads are a common feature of the American landscape. Their archaeological excavation and analysis provides a useful supplement to the historical documentary record. The Campus Road Site in Clinton, NY is one such site. A previous study of nails from the site determined that the farmhouse was likely built in the 1870s and burned down in the early 20th century. This study presents the results of further excavations and analysis at the site. It seeks to further refine the site`s chronology and to illuminate aspects of social and economic life at the Campus Road Site. Zori, Colleen (University of California, Los Angeles) and Erika Brant (University of Virginia) [39] Landscapes of Conflict and Resolution: Warfare, Ritual and Trade in the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1000-1450) in the Quebrada de Tarapacá, Northern Chile The Late Intermediate Period (AD 1000-1450) in the Quebrada de Tarapacá of northern Chile is characterized by two contrasting forms of social interaction: warfare and inter-regional trade. Combining settlement data with an analysis of both the built environment and the anthropogenic landscape, we demonstrate that the development of successively more defensible architecture in the valley was paralleled by the creation of two distinct arenas for conflict resolution. The first consists of public spaces within fortified sites that served to mediate intra-group conflict. The second, consisting of isolated ritual sites in spectacular natural settings, would have facilitated inter-group interaction, including trade.

The ceramic data suggests important differences between the occupations of Pukara de Khonkho and neighboring coeval settlements, which may help to create a better understanding of issues of community identity formation, craft production, population movement, and intercommunity interaction in Late Intermediate Period Bolivia.

Zuckerman, Molly (SC Institute of Archaeology & Anthropology) [16] Mercury in the midst of Mars and Venus: Reconstructing gender and socioeconomic status in the context of mercury treatments for syphilis in early modern England (c. 1650-1864) This study examines trace element concentrations in skeletons (N=30) with acquired syphilis from 17th to 19th century London for evidence of differential treatment with mercury. Controversial historical evidence suggests that access to mercury, the dominant contemporary treatment for syphilis, varied dependent on sufferer`s gender and socioeconomic status, but actual practice is indecipherable in documentary evidence. Hg concentrations were assessed via X-RF in the above, a non-pathological control sample (N=70), and soil samples (N=15). Skeletal evidence and historical context was employed to estimate gender (i.e., embodied schemas), following the assumption that gendered ideologies and economic realities produced systematic effects on access. Zufah, Charles (CSU Long Beach) [163] LiDAR Survey of Soconusco, Chiapas This poster will be presenting the result of an airborne LiDAR survey of the eastern Soconusco region of Chiapas, Mexico. LiDAR, or Light Detection and Ranging, is a remote sensing technique that, utilizing very rapid laser pulse which record both the xy coordinates as well as the elevation of the point they hit, is able to provide high resolution images of terrain and elevation. Using the data received from this survey, I will identify and map the prehistoric man-made earthworks found in the region to provide a basis for future pedestrian survey. Zutter, Cynthia (MacEwan University) [25] Tea, Medicines and Spruce...the role of Wood and Woody plants in Labrador Inuit Economies The role of wood in Labrador Inuit architecture has provided a multitude of results, including climate reconstructions and site occupation time lines (D`Arrigo, R., B. Buckley, S. Kaplan and J. Woollett 2003) Although this is important, the use of woody plants in Inuit life ways is much more rich and diverse. The following paper will present results from 17th C. Inuit sites along the Northern coast of Labrador that exemplify the variety of uses and ubiquity of wood and woody plants by these Arctic peoples.
